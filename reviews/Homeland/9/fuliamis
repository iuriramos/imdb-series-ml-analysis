First of all i am not Muslim, but i'd been raised as a Muslim and i live in a not radical but temperately Islamic country < especially for last years, thanks to our government!>. May be that's one of the reason that i like this show. The show is tells us the what's wrong about both sides clearly.

The major reason which makes me like this show is acting. It seems everyone is doing their job very well done. 

"Spoilers begin"

my negative criticism about the show is to writers. What the hell? why did you killed Brody. I know that you wanted to kill him at the end of first season but you didn't. If he'd be dead by then there won't be any problem. But you did not do that. That's why you've should not kill him after 3 years, after we loved him so much. That's was a huge mistake and you proved me by bringing him back (even as a hallucination) in the episode 'Redux'. 

Yes, I still love the show but this is different kind of love right now. Shame on you!

And also AL Qaeda and Iran? that was kind a pushing too hard.

My suggestion is whatever you do bring Brody back, even a far-fetched way i will accept. i am sure that everyone will be glad.
