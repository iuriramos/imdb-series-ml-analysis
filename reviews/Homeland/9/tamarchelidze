I started watching Homeland after Game of Thrones (which blew my mind), and I loved it. And I LOVED most its 4th season. One could argue about it, but I though it was the best season they've done. I can't argue about misrepresentation of factual circumstances (whether or not locations or bias are real), I can say, it is a fiction, a story, and it is damn captivating, nerve wrecking, full of twists and surprises. It makes you think all the time what's going to happen next, and you think you can predict, but actually it twists in a way that makes your jaw drop. That's what I love about Homeland. And particularly about its season 4. I am looking forward to the next season!
