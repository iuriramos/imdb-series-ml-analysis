This show is like what 24 could've been had it been based in reality. It also shows that you don't need multiple murders and torturing in every episode to make terrorism/counter-terrorism gripping and suspenseful. Claire Danes plays crazy like a champ, and even though the emotional bits can start to get annoying, she is usually right and that makes you root for her. Damian Lewis does a fabulous guilty-conscience/conflicted veteran type. The CIA should actually recruit Mandy Patinkin to interrogate terrorist. The only stereotypical character is David Estes, the angry black chief who wants all the credit and doesn't want to upset his political connections.
