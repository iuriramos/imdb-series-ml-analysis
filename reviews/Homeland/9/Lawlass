I hesitated in purchasing the DVDs of this show, because I am not a fan of Claire Danes. But I heard so much hype about how great this series is, that I caved in and bought seasons one and two. I am almost finished with season two, and I have found Homeland to be vastly entertaining and intriguing.

I disagree with the reviews which criticize some of the slower-moving scenes, as being unnecessary or dull. I like the plot lines dealing with the family issues of the returning POW and believe that those moments have made Nicholas Brody an interesting, complex, character. Instead of being a robotic, Manchurian Candidate-like character, Brody's interactions with his family show the human, normal, side of a man whose conscience is in an erratic state of flux and peril. His daughter, who is a troubled teenager, is ironically, the stabilizing force for the more-troubled Marine. The actress who plays Brody's daughter is the scene-stealer of this show, outshining the much-hailed veteran acting cast.

The only downside of this program is Claire Danes, who is difficult to listen to when she delivers her lines, because she is so over-the-top and bordering on hysterics in nearly every scene. The fault for this probably lies more with the writers and director than the actress. While Danes is indeed playing a character who is suffering from some serious mental disorder, she cusses, yells, cries and contorts her face into ugly forms throughout every episode. It is simply unbelievable that the CIA would allow this person to even have a guest pass to its headquarters, let alone be an employee. Cannot the writers of the show give us some moments of an unwired Carrie with a quiet mind, such that her character becomes a bit more believable, or at least, likable?
