When first watching the series It does not make me much interesting but after watching it on 1-2 episodes it made me very interesting.I thought while watching the series characters my be real but after completing two seasons I came to know these are compared to real incidents and taken,but truly series had wonderful drama and thriller master piece.i imagined second season last episode would be end of series but some things ends in unexpected way.The writers and directors of every season are creating very interesting for each episode.Cast of the series are doing well.Every series will have flaw,but till know it is very minor in my opinion.

Finally homeland till know is excellent hopping till end of series will be as interesting thriller.so I had given 9/10.
