It's interesting reading the previous comments because what people seem to say is that Homeland is either: 1. "Dumb American, racist propaganda that makes the US out to be the true heros fighting all the worlds terrorists" or 2. "Nothing but United States Citizens as traitors, liars, mass murders" or 3. Bad acting or 4. 10/10 ....

I have to say I'd have put it somewhere around a 7 and into season for a few episodes I was leaning to moving it down to a 6 or so and just stopping watching all together. I took a break off for a couple weeks, came back and the next 7 episodes in season for were tremendous and you are routing for and against people on all sides.

I find the acting a mixed bag: - Claire Danes is fine and sometimes amazing the way she portrays the mental illness of her character but other times the writing of the character seems lazy.

- I really like Mandy Patinkin in the show.

- Rupert Friend is my fav character in Quinn.

- Damian Lewis did a solid Job in his role.

If you can put up with some odd character choices and some errors in real world locations it's an okay spy drama I feel is elevated in season 4. I have seen season 5 year but the show went from teetering off a cliff to being a good one for me.
