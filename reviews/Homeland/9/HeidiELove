CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Clare Danes) is not convinced the rescued soldier Nick Brody (Damian Lewis) is not a double agent of al-Qaida.

This is an intriguing and engaging Drama that challenges American Political morales and tackles a very controversial issue - War and al-Qaida.

The Action is in the background but what is more interesting is the relationships developed between these characters. It is about family and love, betrayal and ruin. All the characters suffer within the plot. 

Up against "Breaking Bad" this show did very well. The series has received critical acclaim, as well as several industry awards, including winning the 2012 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series Â– Drama, and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Damian Lewis and Claire Danes respectively. Showtime renewed the series for a second season of twelve episodes,[5] which premiered on September 30, 2012

I am really looking forward to the new "Homeland" with Carrie in the Lead.
