Season 5 is a very stunning and realistic season of Homeland. I am obsessed with Claire Danes' performance. After 5 seasons, I think this TV series still ranks at high quality. In this season I admire its thriller and mystery. The new leading female role, Allison Carr, gives me an important impression. Her betrayal to country is hateful, but her conclusion, to a certain degree, it serves her right, but in another sense, she is poor. And the two computer hackers, who wish to sell intelligence to the KGB, I think their conclusion is right too. A normal and foolish person can never have any relationship with espionage. After watching this show, I myself wishes to join the CIA too, but the question is how can I? Does anyone has a good suggestion? It is really interesting.
