Breathtaking cast!! Claire Danes is stunning, I mean outstanding! Every aspiring actress should get a role like hers, try and depict a bipolar character. She does it sublime.

Homeland is much more interesting than the 2 lines of explanation suggest: intelligent written thriller that doesn't bore any minute. The only part I FFed was when Terri goes to her Sisters house for the first time. This is a major scoop, for I rarely watch any TV-series in total, and more often than not fast forward plot lines that don't interest me.

The only few minor negative points I can think of, is some rather unbelievable plot twists like: *spoiler time, stop reading from here if you haven't watched the show*

- A POW turned with a suicide mission, going soft on the moment supreme? I seriously doubt it. If he was fanatic enough to go all the way, then he would never ave stopped at the end.

- Im pretty sure the CIA would not let people get off without any charge after wearing a bomb vest near half the future US government. Not even if Brody would hand them over Satan himself. Most likely still get several years in jail, probably only spared death row.

- Terry meets Brody at noon, and gets a call from Saul moments later. His watch reads 11:15. Sloppy.

- A tortured POW, held for 8 years in captivity and when he gets back no psychological support whatsoever? I find that hard to believe.
