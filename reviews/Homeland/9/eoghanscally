Every week I anticipate a new episode of Homeland, and every week I'm highly satisfied. With a strong cast, this show never fails to deliver a heart stopping story-line.

With excellent writing and directing, Homeland shows that good T.V is still out there. Every week my heart beats so fast as the show reaches a climax and I am always satisfied with the conclusion, and left in agony for the next episode

I think the strongest point of the show is the acting, Claire Danes portrayal of Carrie Mathison, a CIA agent with a bi-polar disorder, who is the only one who believes the Marine Nicolas Brody is now a terrorist, is the most realistic acting I have ever seen on T.V. She brings something to the role which I think no other actress can, although I think there are too many scenes where we see her crying face, which is annoying. 

Also Damian Lewis portrayal of Nicolas Brody a turned U.S Marine, now a terrorist after 8 years in captivity, is outstanding. He shows the real struggle a soldier faces when coming back from 8 years away from people and connecting with his family once more, and trying to hide his alter- ego terrorist.

With a superb cast, directing, and writing, Homeland is the show to watch, yes some parts are unrealistic, but its not a documentary, I only fear that it will soon get too unbelievable, but I have every faith in the writers. So get watching if you want your heart going 100 miles an hour..
