A Show that will follow Dexter on Showtime and is created by Producers of '24' was enough to make me excited. The pilot is fantastic and has the capability to produce a lot of weekly loyal viewers. 

The Story is about a US Marine (Damian Lewis) who returned home after being held captive for 10 years by terrorists and has immediately caught the attention of public and press as a National Hero. But a CIA agent (Claire Danes) thinks otherwise and place the Marine as part of a terrorist plot and spies on him.

The Plot of the show is simple enough yet It has a lot of room to expand and go in a lot of different directions. Damian Lewis did an excellent job with his character, Claire Danes felt a little short from her character but her character will be explored more and i think she will grow into it as the series progresses. Morena Baccarin role as Marine's wife is also worth mentioning as She is in the center of it all with some secrets of her own.

So far it has the same '24' like twists and thrills as both main characters play each other in a game of cat and mouse.
