Guys, don't be hurry, read me to the end, I read somewhere that it's the favorite series to president Obama,so, I bought the series, I watched the only first episode then Iam hooked !!! Great acting, huge producing , and perfect directing... all are genuine, even the beginning song , and Iam sure you will love it, its like "Person of Interest" series in action acting , "CSI" in analyzing,"Breaking bad" in mystery and human conflict in dealing with their Conscious disorders, its a smart show, dedicated for smart viewers..

I recommend you to watch, do not listen to bad critics, Iam sure they hate politics,and tactics...its great show for great minds..
