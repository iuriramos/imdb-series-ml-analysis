Personally, I have never been, totally, absorbed with a TV. series, as I have with "Homeland." Partially because of the content of the wonderfully revelent and brilliantly written plots. The other half is the performance by Damian Lewis....a superb and brilliant actor! Damian's portrayal is heart wrenching and sympathetic while, at times, deplorable and shocking. He tries to do the right thing, but he struggles to please everyone and he becomes easily manipulated. Carrie's harsh treatment toward Brody, initially , was unsettling, and I couldn't understand how Brody could forgive, but his character needed her help, and, of course, he had "turned" against America. The final episode brought tears. I wonder if I can revisit "Homeland" when there is no Brody.?
