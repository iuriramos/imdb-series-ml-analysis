All of the characters are great, with all around superb acting. Although the people who made this show also made 24, I'm not sure why people are comparing the two...they are very different. I would definitely recommend this show! Not sure why some people are giving it 1/10 that just seems ridiculous to me. Anyway if you love a show that will keep you hooked with an interesting story then Homeland is the show for you. Having a lead character with bi-polar disorder adds a great element to the show and makes it much more interesting to watch. I'm also a huge fan of Peter Quinn and hope to see more of him in the future of the show! Overall I'm incredibly happy with how Homeland has turned out and believe they deserve all the award nominations and wins!
