Greetings from Lithuania.

Going to be short here. 

This show is definitely the best one i saw in 2012 yet. 

The acting is outstanding especially from the two leads.

This is brilliantly written, smart and realistic show.

It's very interesting, what they will show in a season two cause the series climax is completely spell-binding.

As it is a TV serial, most every episode ends with an obligatory twist or turn or revelation about one of the characters. Unlike other shows , these revelations are not contrived or unrealistic.

This is a must see for all people who enjoys good shows.
