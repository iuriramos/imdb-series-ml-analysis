This is the best show on TV. It will keep you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode and keep you coming back. The first few episodes are a little slow, but it eventually gets to be the most suspenseful show ever created IMO. The writing is perfect and everything you see will later come back. The plot is also probably the most intricate of all shows, though still easily followed. The characters are so realistic and you will go from not understanding them to fully understanding them and watch them develop. I can't believe it has just an 8.6, I'd put it up there with Breaking Bad for sure. Give it a chance!
