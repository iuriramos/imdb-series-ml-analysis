I thought season 1 was enjoyable, nothing special, it just seemed a bad copy of 24. But season 2 ... WOW ! It's just great. The plot is great, the twists make the series breathtaking, and even the love story between Carry and Brody make sense and is well built( I usually don't like love stories in this kind of series ). I also love how the series shows us indirectly how things work on the upper floors of the government, where we realize that we are aware of like only 5 % of what happenes in our government. The acting by Damian Lewis was fantastic, i thought he was great and I can't wait for season 3 to air, hoping it is as good as this one.
