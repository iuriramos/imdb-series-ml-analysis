Homeland is a masterpiece. It started with a really strong 1st season that made you stay tuned no matter what. However many fans of the show found that the second season fell short of their expectations and that a few episodes during the end of the season lacked plausibility. Well I have to totally disagree with them and say that Homeland's 2nd season is a masterpiece as well.

I have to admit that as approaching to the finale, some episodes seemed a little extreme and hyperbolic. But after watching the 2nd season finale I have to say that I take everything back! So many things were explained and in the most unexpected way. Every weird moment suddenly transformed into a well-written requirement that lead to this triumphant closure.

Hating episodes is easy but it's the big picture that we must see. It is true that every episode must be able to stand alone but let's don't forget that Homeland is a serial drama. And serial dramas have transition episodes. After all what Homeland's writers pulled is impressive. Make transition episodes action packed!
