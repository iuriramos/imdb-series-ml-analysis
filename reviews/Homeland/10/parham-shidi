i'm only writing this because there were some negative reviews which were not fair and very stupid! first of all some people come and talk about locations and other things not being accurate in reply please pay attention to this point that in the last two seasons (1.Iran , 2.pakistan ) the first won't let Americans to make a movie in and the second is totally unsafe to do so! so they had to film it somewhere else.and it's almost impossible to make an other country the same as the original one, but they did a good job making a similar one.only Iranians and Pakistanis would know the difference. then somebody said why they don't have good accents and in the 4 season people were using Indian version of urdu , what do you expect? most of the actors and actresses are Indian( since pakistanis won't play in a show that shows the bad face of their country) and in the Iran season most of them were iranian national except for 1 or two which they had to use foreigners since obviously they couldn't have found more iranian actors.

in case of carrie being annoying ,i agree , her face and almost crying in every scene is bugging me as well. in CIA or any other intelligent agency, it's impossible to find the similar character.these people are like machines,they are trained this way to be able to operate in very complicated situations.i'm sure they don't cry when they talk. beside this small issue ,the plot is magnificent! i hope it will be a 10 season show. watch it!!!
