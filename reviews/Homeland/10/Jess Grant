My wife and I love this show. One of its best features is its moral ambiguity, such as when Abu Nazir (the Bad Guy) mutters about the madrassa drone bombing that killed his son, "and they call us terrorists." Brody's anger at VP Walden for lying about the bombing, and his condemnation of him as a "war criminal," is a healthy antidote to the jingoistic pap we're fed every day in the news. Brody's motive to avenge Isa's murder offers patriotic Americans some much-needed perspective on political "blowback" against the U.S.

Other examples of this subversive aspect include: Dana correcting her classmate on the difference between Arabs and Persians; Brody's silent fury at Jess for desecrating his copy of the Koran; Carrie's request that the FBI agent remove his shoes in the mosque; and the fact that, of Aileen and Fareek, it's the blonde American who's driving the terrorism, not the brown-skinned Arab. All these scenes weigh against the usual demonization of Islam in this country.

Well-written and wonderfully cast, we are totally hooked.
