How can I say anything negative about Homeland. One of, and arguably the best drama action series ever filmed. 

Mandy Patinkin... you are amazing! If you don't win best supporting actor in the next Emmy Awards... something is wrong with the system. And your bizarre chemistry with Claire Danes is not something to be ignored. You two on camera together absolutely command the attention of viewers... (It's weirdly powerful stuff). Congrats to you two and keep up the good work. I just love when things come together perfectly... and Homeland is just the ticket in this case. 

Looking forward to awards for the fruits of your labor... and to season 3 of Homeland. 

Take care!
