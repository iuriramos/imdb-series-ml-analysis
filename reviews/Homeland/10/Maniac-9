Showtime has hit a home run with their new series Homeland starring Damian Lewis and Claire Danes. It's about a Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody(Lewis) who was taken as a prisoner of war for the past 8 years that an CIA Agent Carrie Mathison(Danes) believes has been turned by Al Qaeda. While Brody comes home as a hero, Mathison has her doubts about him. Just such an intriguing idea for a show that unravels it's layers one by one learning a little bit more about the puzzle each and every episode. It's not till the end of the first season where you really even know where Brody really stands. Just such a great modern show that has some real life practicalities about it, like this stuff could actually take place in the current world climate.
