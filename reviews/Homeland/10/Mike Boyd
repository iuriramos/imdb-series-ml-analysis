Claire Danes' acting is superb. I always thought she was a typical dumb blonde comedy actress, but in this series she is magnificent. The story line is very simple - is he a terrorist or isn't he? And Claire Danes is the one who knows more than most the truth. But even she gets fooled but then realises the truth again.

The series climax is completely spell-binding. And Claire Danes' character asks the daughter to telephone her dad to try to get him to change his mind, and although the daughter doesn't believe for a second he could be a terrorist, she still calls him and it is enough to make him change his mind.

And then the climax - she remembers the dead boy's name and that Brody knew him - he called out his name during the night. She remembers just as she is about to undergo electric shock treatment. Will she remember the link when she wakes up? What a fantastic series! Roll on series 2.
