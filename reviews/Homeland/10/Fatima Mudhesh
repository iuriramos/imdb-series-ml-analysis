This is an excellent work of direction and acting and I was so engrossed in it, that I used to watch it late nights. "Carrie Mathinson" is a woman who puts her mind, body and soul in her work. She is a bit psycho but I love her determination. "Nicholas Brody" is a mysterious man, that made me doubt him yet pity him, and monitor his acts. Frankly the other characters didn't much pulled my interest. My interest was captured by Carrie and Nicholas, and I was totally involved in them. I like the plot, a very absorbing one. The details are good, and I enjoyed the show. If you like thriller, mystery and drama, this is the show you shouldn't miss. This show won't let you down, and you would feel as if something really is going on, and you are aware of it. I kind of felt this would be coming in News.
