At the end of the episode, we see Carrie as she arrives back home. She's a wreck. Her doubts about herself, her near death, the intensity of her experience in Beirut and her letdown as she returns to "ordinary life" have taken their toll. She is a spy. It is her whole identity. It's why she rushed into Fatima's building heedless of her own safety.

In the final scene, we see Saul going through the items that Carrie retrieved. The papers have revealed noting of importance. But Saul feels something sewn into the ling of the bag. He rips the bag open and retrieves an SD chip. He puts the chip into his computer and plays it. It is a video recording of the confession that Brody recorded before his aborted suicide mission. Had the mission been carried out, the video would have been released. Saul has essentially spied on Brody when he found and watched this video.

Now what? Brody is exposed. Is the series over? What happens next? Will Brody become a "triple agent"? Will he be turned into an unwitting tool of the CIA? This discovery certainly took me by surprise. I don't know what to think. Guess I'll just have to watch next Sunday.

This is the last three paragraphs of the full review that I did at Premium Cable Reviews.
