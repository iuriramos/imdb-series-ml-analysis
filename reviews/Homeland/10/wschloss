I think Brody looks like Homer Simpson. Carrie too has a face that looks like she could be a Simpson. I like the series a lot but I cant help seeing this in every episode. I need ten lines: Brody's family is annoying. Jessica is so annoying I don't even notice how hot she is anymore. Roya, Mira and now Esme are HOT, Thank you. The plot is very believable and I think educational for Americans. I can't believe Brody doesn't jump from the Tower of David. Will it be explained why Brody is in South America? I think Peter Quinn is my favorite character along with Saul. Good for Mandy Patankin, he deserves the career boost. This is meant more as a comment than a review.
