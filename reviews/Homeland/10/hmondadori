Featuring an outstanding Claire Danes performance in your best character and also with particular attention to Damian Lewis and Mandy Patinkin. The series constructs and deconstructs human and conflicting characters. The narrative is not tedious and most the episodes have plausible twists. Dense and fast dialogues plus the alternation of the characters between protagonist and antagonist results in an accelerated narrative. Not showing the amateurism in visual effects or film setting that affects most of the spy genre series. I highlight the unpredictability as the main feature of the series and for me this is the best series ever seen on TV in this genre.
