Possibly one of the best shows I've ever watched. Homeland is well made, it keeps you guessing and makes you think. I was a bit apprehensive because it was one of the first TV shows that have been based on the War on Terror, but after watching the pilot, I was hooked. Claire Danes pulls out all stops and is absolutely incredible as a (possibly unstable) CIA officer (Carrie Mathison) and deserves all the awards she's getting. Damien Lewis is outstanding as well, who thought a Englishman would play an American marine THAT well that they get an award for it! 

Plus the little story lines (including Jessica Brody's relationship with his husband's best friend, Carrie's relationship with Nicholas Brody, Carrie's bipolar disorder, Faisel's house underneath the flightpath) are well made. The flashback sequences are well made as well, in fact, there is more to like than not to like.
