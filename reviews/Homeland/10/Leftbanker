It seems like this series has learned from its mistakes, namely not to have children in the mix of the story. The first couple of seasons were pretty dreadful, at least when they dealt with Brody's teenage daughter. So many series suffer from this Meadow Soprano syndrome. I judge characters by how much I enjoy seeing them on screen. His daughter and then later the baby were way below my enjoyment radar. By the fourth season Homeland had switched to a pure action genre and its quality quadrupled, in my book. No babies and no teenagers and none of their boring and insignificant problems, just intrigue on a high level.

I could use this review as a boilerplate for reviews of a lot of series of this nature. Breaking Bad went slightly off the rails dealing with his family garbage. I hated every scene with his mush-mouth son and his baby. His wife was also mostly a drag on the story. I sort of get what they were doing by that didn't make it even remotely interesting for me. I hated Tony Soprano's retarded family. I wish that at least I would have been given the satisfaction of seeing Meadow and AJ gunned down in cold blood in the series last scene. His wife would have been a nice addition to the dead list as well.
