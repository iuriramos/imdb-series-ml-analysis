Overall, I enjoyed Homeland's season 4; the departure of Brody didn't hamper the series reboot. I will admit, I found the season 4 finale boring. The episodes that I recommend are "13 Hours in Islamabad" and "Krieg Nicht Lieb." Fantastic suspense in both episodes! The ambiance of Pakistan could be more realistic, less grimy. Contrary to Homelands' portrayal, Islamabad is a picturesque city. Homeland's usage of Urdu is strange - the incorrect translation of English phrases to Urdu on signs and the unfamiliar Urdu accent. Jaffrey and Nimrat Kaur are great actors, easy on the eyes, and wonderful additions to the season 4 cast. Nazanin Boniadi made me cry, she will be missed. Another surprise performance in season 4 is Rupert Friend, "Krieg Nicht Lieb" should be the season 4 finale.
