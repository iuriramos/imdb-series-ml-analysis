I was, since the beginning of this show, a big fan, but after seeing the 11th episode of season 3 I have to say... BEST SERIES EVER !!

I ended up, in the end of that episode shaking. It's so intense, that it feels that you are inside the action and bounded with the characters. It's a torture to wait a week for the next episode and to even think that one day this sow will end. The acting is astonishing, the landscapes and all combined give us viewers a great experience. I strongly recommend this show to everybody

Can't wait for the season finally, a truly 10* !

Thanks Claire Danes, Damian Lewis and all other actors and producers.
