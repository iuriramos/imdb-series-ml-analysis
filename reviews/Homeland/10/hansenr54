I sit thru the whole episode and almost always can't believe the episode is over. Writing is believable and dramatic and there are many subplots happening that give you a panoramic view of not just the intense lives of the CIA game but the mundane challenges of everyday life. We get to see the emotional ride that the main characters experience and how they handle the morality of each situation. How each main character thru their choices have built their own prisons and lonely lives. The actors are great! I have always appreciated Claire and she easily navigates the roller coaster ride her character is on. Damion's range is awesome and Mandy delivers a subtle but powerful presentation.
