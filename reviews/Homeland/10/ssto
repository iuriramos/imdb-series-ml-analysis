i'd hardly give 10 to a movie, let alone a TV show.

'homeland' though, definitely deserves highest marks. there has never been a US TV show that would shake me this much, make me actually think what is happening, what is causing a person to act this way, leave me wondering "is he lying, or is this the truth", "does he really love her" and so on.

'homeland' actually makes me feel for the characters, which is simply astonishing. the story is so unpredictable and so deep that there is probably material for a few more seasons, yet (for Lost's sake) i regretfully hope all ends with season 2.

the cast is wonderful, the only two weak characters for me are brody's son and cia's director, estes. Claire Danes plays her role in a magnificent way that is probably hard to find in theaters, let alone a TV show. Damian Lewis's character is absolutely unpenetratable. mid-season 2 i still cannot tell how he's going to react to this or that and what path will he take, not to mention is he lying, telling the truth, or half-truth. still cannot be sure if he'll turn out a monster or maybe do "right thing" (although we know he believes he IS doing it)

ah....simply enjoying 'homeland' - and actually i never intended to sit and watch it, based on the premise of a POW returning home, but it is a beautiful piece of TV art - altogether the story, acting and production

cannot wait for the next episode, yay :)
