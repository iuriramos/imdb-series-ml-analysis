The BEST TV drama on TV...period! Showtime has joined the ranks of HBO with this one. I was a huge fan of Six Feet Under, Breaking Bad, and The Killing. This show is like watching a Bourne movie every episode. It's that good. 

I have been searching for a new show and found it. I can't believe the budget Showtime has for this series. Watch this! You will not be disappointed. If you want to see what bipolar type I is about, the lead character does a good job. She has similar energy to "Deb" from Dexter. 

What makes this so good is the space between the notes. The director/writer/whomever has the confidence to allow for space rather than pull an Aaron Sorkin and dialog you to death. This really is art.
