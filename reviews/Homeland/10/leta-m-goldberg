Claire Danes is the most brilliant actress on television. I have not seen any of her movies and I am embarrassed to say that. Damian Lewis is also a magnificent actor as is Mandy Patinkin et al. A year and a half ago my only son died. Anyone who goes through grief from losing a child knows that your mind and heart are fixed on one thing.....your lost child. The only drama that has been able to hold my attention for any length of time is the series "Homeland". Maybe that does not say much for me and my life, but I have an undergrad in English Literature and a Masters Degree. I LOVE to read. But what could be more gripping than a narrative which deals with issues effecting the entire world. In a book I am reading called Justice and the Enemy, the author compares the Nuremburg trials and the potential trial of Sheik Mohamed. As he points out, we defeated Germany...what do we do with a violent minority whose only goals is the destruction of the entire western world? Homeland appeals to the intellect who enjoys magnificent acting, accurate details and global issues; a series which leaves us discussing or questioning the reality of terrorism.
