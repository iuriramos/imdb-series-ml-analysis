Finally a captivating series for my generation. 22 years old and LOVE current events/military. I actually found myself glued to this series just by seeing the trailer. I can't wait for next weeks episode. This is a psychological-thriller to the T. I feel that the series wouldn't be as captivating if it wasn't for Claire Danes' character and the question of her mental stability. The script and characters really provide a great cat and mouse game.

In response to ScapegoatsOfTheEmpire, The Marine Corps does not salute when indoors and are to remove their covers upon entering anything indoors. They are only required to salute a CO if they are under arms. Which he was not. I just wanted to clarify that, to prevent anyone from thinking otherwise.
