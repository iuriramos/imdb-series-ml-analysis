Top quality TV is a rare thing, but this particular TV show definitely deserves that praise. Its content is realistic, its subject matter all too current, the plot tense yet utterly believable, the acting simply superb. Claire Danes' Carrie Mathison character is a wonderfully human portrait of a professional in a sordid but alas essential business, as prone as any other to human foibles and fallacies. Her performance however does not detract from those of others, notably the Saul Berenson character, brilliantly portrayed as well. In a word, the series is superb, and its writers, cast and producers merit congratulations. People at Showtime: more of this, please - and yes, I know I'm asking much.
