Yeah,it's true. Homeland is actually US President's favorite show.How can a president give support to a TV show so polemic about his country like Homeland is about United States,you ask. Well i can't tell you the reason why is that but i do understand that Obama's "movieaholic" side talks louder when it comes to this special TV show. Homeland is such an emotive and sensational story about Carrie who is a CIA chief that has her life completely focused on her job and her country.The main action theme? This so common but interesting - ISIS vs US Government. So every episode is full of life with all it's madness, decision and risk that follows this confront putting you on the side of US,like we are used to.Still we can't forget the way that the producers explores all the dark side of this man and women work on the field (CIA people) it might be a bit to deep, making it polemic in one way but quite real in another. I gave it 10 and i'm sure that a lot of people that follows this show think the same as well. It's just brilliant!
