I have watched so many TV series an none of them are like homeland! One of the best, if not the best thing on TV in the last 5 years. The story is amazing, the characters are so developed and so profound, that you watch it in awe. Damien Lewis and Claire Danes are so good that you believe them every step of the way. And the most important thing about this show is that this is an American hero story with a twist and you can see the other side of terrorism, the other side of the picture... I absolutely recommend, if not for the story, then for the amazing acting, especially Claire Danes, this girl deserves every award on this planet for this role.
