When I see Homeland on showtime, I always get excited for the second season. Sargent Brody(Damian Lewis) is one scary character. Great acting, it was a thrill to watch him each episode. Carrie Mathison(Claire Danes) Is a trip. Claire Danes, a woman not very big is the film business, gives a spectacular performance. She is now on my radar and has proved she can act. All supporting characters, sub-stories, and the main story about a P.O.W. gone for 8 years, now returns and suspected to be turned, working for the biggest terrorist threat, Abu Nazir. Homeland will truly have you guessing and second guessing what you first thought. A show for everyone to watch.
