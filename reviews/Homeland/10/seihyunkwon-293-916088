When I started watching this series, I was't sure what to expect. It looked like a 24 with no action and macho-ism possibly. It was a little boring to start with. CIA, terrorist... all the usual stuff. 

Characters are engines for this fantastic drama. An American Marine who are brainwashed planning to attack his own country. Okay, that's a little different. He is also a father of two and loves his family. I think that's quite a conflict. The actor who played Brody was exceptional. Is it ridiculous that he is a terrorist and also a father? No. It's a real dilemma.

Carrie. According to Saul, one of the smartest but the stupidest person. A brilliant agent but also emotionally vulnerable. 

I thought the love story between Brody and Carrie is a little bit of too much dramatization but you know when acting is so damn good, you get to nod your head. 

What they show us, it's real pain and emotion. 

Also, there is an idea something people in U.S. are not exactly used to. 

What if those people that U.S. attacked and killed during wars, their friends and families and come right back and attack people in U.S. soil? 

That wasn't something people used to or wanted to watch on TV. 

Now it's on. interesting. More of real story in prime television show.
