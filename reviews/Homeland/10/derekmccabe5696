From the start of the first episode this show immediately hooked me. With it's non stop twists and turns you will want to make sure you catch every episode.I highly enjoyed every moment so far and am always left wanting more, the thing that struck me the most that I thought really stood out was characters which are all brilliant and with flawless acting. Reminds me of one of my other favorite shows 24 at times. It never makes you feel like you know what's going to happen next which is a must for me, but I also never felt it took to long to get to the point or was drawn out at all either. All in all just a really great show that deserves your time guaranteed that you will not be let down or let down.
