I got absolutely hooked on the show! Having watched a number of series and films, I tend to predict the ending of any thriller, action etc, but when I am wrong or I don't know what to expect - that's when I get particularly hooked on the show/film. Homeland, for sure, made it interesting for me in every single episode and left me hanging for more. Not a lot of shows have such a great suspense through out! I waited anxiously for every episode :)

I also absolutely love the acting of the main characters who replicate raw emotions exceptionally well. Cant wait for season 3 and I hope it stays on the same level!
