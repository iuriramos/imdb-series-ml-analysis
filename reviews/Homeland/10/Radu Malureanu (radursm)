Now... Homeland is not necessarily original. I recommend Hatufim , an interesting Israeli production, which was the inspiration for the script-writers of the series. Nonetheless, the topic twists, the sensibility of Carrie, the complexity of Saul, the oxymoron that is called Brody. the secondary plots (which, by themselves, define a good point for another autonomous story), made me believe that Homeland is a masterpiece beyond cheap propaganda, stereotypes, all-hail-America movies. It is about intelligence. I mean: intelligent. So. if you are somewhat interested in understanding some of the hidden strings of this twisted world, a bit romantic and idealistic, a believer that there is a greater good up there, I totally recommend watching it. Seriously, completely, free-of-mind-like, rationally, loving what democracy, humanity, sacrifice in the upper-level battles might be. Homeland has become one of my most favourite TV productions until now.
