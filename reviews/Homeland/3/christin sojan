A wonderful and captivating series..with a few crappy twists..but nevertheless enjoyable..but if u like the character "FARA" i suggest u stop watching at S4E10..the next one made it a very crappy one..which destroyed the entire series for me..but like i said it is entertaining...but it may also be a bit slow but bear with it.. it is worth the wait ...until S311..in the end it is just gruesome..which could get u saying what the fish(****) man... but if u have better stuffs to do..i suggest u try daredevil or arrow this ain't as good but the crappy tragedy certainly destroyed it for me.. but if u don't like Fara this is an awesome series made for the patient heart..bear through..ENJOY
