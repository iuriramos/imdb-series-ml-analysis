I've only watched 5 episodes so far, but I just don't get it. I've heard this touted as the next 24, but it's nowhere near as good (comparing it to the first series of 24), nor would I even start to compare it with 24. Homeland is very slow, and just seams to be drifting along, as yet there are no twists and turns, no cleverness in it's storyline, no surprises or elements that keep you guess between episodes. May be some of this is to come, but's that if I stick with it to find out. I'm finding that I don't really care about any of the characters such as Carrie (the CIA agent) or about Brody's family. Damian Lewis is acting his role as Nicholas Brody well, but Claire Danes is very poor, and Morena Baccarin is a much better/ stronger actress than she is showing here. I can't believe it has a current rating of 8.6 on here, but may be that because there is more to come in the later episodes (and I really hope so) and may be it's just that people want some that's fairly easy to watch without complicated twists and turns from the likes of Lost, flash-forward and 24 etc.
