I started watching "Homeland" because I was bored. I started researching it a bit and found I the creators were also the ones behind "24," the Fox drama that somehow became the chief piece of evidence for the effectiveness of torture and was a favorite of Dick Cheney. I found that even though it was a Obama's favourite series and was hugely popular that no one spoke of the racism. I mean the plot becomes increasingly absurd and totally Islamophobic. All the standard stereotypes about Islam and Muslims are reinforced, and it is demonstrated ad nauseam that anyone marked as "Muslim" by race or creed can never be trusted. Then I thought about the latest candidate running for US presidency Trump and the sort of anti- Muslim rhetoric he uses. It all makes sense. Take one scene supposedly set in a famous and fashionable street in Beirut - in Series 2, episode 2 titled "Beirut is Back". Its The upper class neighborhood of Hamra street but in Homeland it is shown as den-like place populated by men in headdresses and women in full hijab shopping in ancient souks while machine-gun-wielding thugs roam the streets. So wrong! There are so many of these inaccuracies. Horrific that no-one much in the US - even well read critics - are not talking about the inaccuracies and racism..
