Another one of the right-wing xenophobic propaganda being circulated on for decades to keep the majority of simple, not-so-informative and don't-care-much Americans who are trying hard to make a decent living, in continuous trepidation that they are on the verge of extinction by some group of people who live at least 6000 or more miles away in primitive conditions in the third worlds with almost no access to modern technology.

It is 21st century and long overdue that the simple, not-so-informative and don't-care-much Americans, in this "People's Democracy", make at least an attempt in this age of information and knowledge to understand about the world they live in and the entities they do business with and reflect on how their actions, in a whole, affect the much bigger world outside their territory as well as in their own and hold its administration, its affiliates and its representatives accountable for their not so constructive proceedings.

Everybody in this world wants to live in peace and comfort and cherish the future. No exception. Unfortunately trouble starts to brew when somebody's existence becomes at risk because of somebody else's actions. The past human history is a testament to that.

As for the drama, it is poorly acted and directed. And stop Xenophobic propaganda. It is only destructive.
