...otherwise how can they truly say that this average-at-best show is so terrific! The best way I can describe it is "a quality production, with a soap-opera level of drawn-out plots which makes it excruciatingly slow, and a plot which seems to have come out of an average spy book off the shelf". The entire 3-season plot can be described in 2 pieces of paper. That's how soap operas last years on end. And don't get me started on Brody's family. There's a filler if I ever saw one. There isn't a single second of family time that has ANYTHING to do with the overall plot. They were just trying to fill in hours. Shame on the sub-average writers, shame on the rest of us who truly WASTED so many hours of our life to NOT be entertained one bit by this sub-average show. Live a little people!.. Not worth your valuable time.
