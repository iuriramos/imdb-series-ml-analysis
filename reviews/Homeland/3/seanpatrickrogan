A study in Claire messing with her hair, going on crying jags, and making awful, over expressive boo-boo faces interspersed with espionage delivered through lazy, plot serving coincidences.

Most of the acting is OK. Liked the first season. Mandy Patankin and Rupert Friend are solid. F Murray Abraham appears out of his element and delivers every sentence like he's in a TV commercial for a one-liner.

Now it's just a tad ridiculous and rides the edges of flirting with reality. Seems as if the off season the staff must spend time sorting through real events and deciding how close to get to it. Could potentially be a recipe for disaster.
