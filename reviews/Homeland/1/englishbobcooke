19th February 2011...Yep! Here I am, English, sympathetic to World crisis and human suffering, so little did I know that by watching the 1st episode of this I would have to suffer. Surely this whole palaver hangs on the main characters, so why are they so far fetched, or are they? After all, this is an American production. No disrespect to the actors, Damien Lewis is brilliant and his daughter has a wonderful bad eye look for the wayward mother. The mad Homeland investigation girl also plays her part...but would these be any where near realcharacters, even in the U.S of A, best leave George Bush out of this I suppose. OK I know it's made for the furthering of American paranoia,on that no comment is needed. If this is going to be UK Channel 4's 2012 flagship Sunday drama, I'll take the popsi challenge that once viewing figures start dropping, this series will also be dropped.
