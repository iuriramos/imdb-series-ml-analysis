I watched the 01 season. The problem was: I watched it after I have seen 8 seasons of 24. From my point of view cliffhangers in season ends is something gone away years ago - though we buried that - but, tada, there is Homeland. And the cliffhangers ending no plot at all just keep going (if they would end at least one story line it would be nice).

The characters are over drawn and very stereotypic and played good but the actors. Applaus!

I'd like to compare it with "how I met your mother" - I know it's a different genre - but it's one that never ends as well. Homeland is the never ending story about homeland security, cia, fbi playing cats and mouse with each others - and of course with their opponents.

One Season is enough.
