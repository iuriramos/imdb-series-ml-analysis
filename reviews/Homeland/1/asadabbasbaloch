This show looks promising in the season one but then goes down the hill. Characters and scenes are very predictable. The lead character has good acting skills but again predictable. He is bound to disobey his superiors and everybody knows that he will be forgiven each and every time. 

But the other than predictability, I have watched 3 seasons and I was thinking on every move that why on earth every one else is dumb and stupid and only CIA has all the tricks up their sleeves. The way Brody character is beaten every time and still he cooperates with CIA is absolutely unreal.

Also this show doesn't have any balance. Leave Irani or Iraqi or Lebanon intelligence this show teaches us that MOSAD and ISI are also dumb. 

If you want to watch a show with balanced realistic scenarios I recommend Dexter.
