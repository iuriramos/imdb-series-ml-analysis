This show is well written, but the writers need to do something more worthwhile with their talents.

The audience is implicitly asked to suspect everyone--and, OF COURSE, especially those scary Muslims--of plotting to blow up civilians. This show is an insult to our intelligence; it plays like a comment by the Showtime executives to the effect of, "If you folks (watching TV) are so smart, why ain't you rich?" The people who decided to field this turkey must think of their audience (us) as a bunch of ignorant peasants.

In short, apart from people studying this program to learn the mechanics of good script-writing, only ill-literate, other-phobic, intelligence-phobic bub-bas (the only way this field would let me spell the word) are going to love it.
