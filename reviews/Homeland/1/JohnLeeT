This program is obsessed with sexual perversion and depicting it gratuitously at every opportunity. Nudity is rampant and uncalled for. There seems to be little plot but for the sick sex scenes and naked women, thrusting and sweating constantly. It is difficult to understand the awards presented to this filth, especially to Lewis for stooping to such garbage after his heroic performance in Band of Brothers. The late Captain Winters, whom he portrayed so beautifully and with such sensitivity, must be abhorred as he looks down on this hateful show. All concerned with the production should be ashamed of themselves for participating in this pornography. The actresses have debased themselves and allowed themselves to be exploited for no dramatic purpose but for ratings alone. Simply a terrible program and one of the sickest to ever appear on television. Most decent people will be sickened by what is depicted in their living rooms.
