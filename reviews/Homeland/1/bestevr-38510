The main character is HORRIBLE!!!! She cries 20+ times every episode! All I see is "chin quivers"!! The whole thing is ridiculous and would never happen. Ugh! I wouldn't mind her being replaced in the middle of an episode at any time. He wouldn't still have been a marine, she wouldn't be allowed to continue to be in the CIA and she sucks. Cry less!!!!!!!!! There are a few characters that make it OK, and overall the show is OK...but I can't make it past crybaby Carrie. Not at all. I liked her in her show on MTV and now I hope to never see her in another show EVER! She can never be redeemed after this performance. Ever. Quinn is cool, the main CIA dude is cool, her role will never be believable or plausible or possible or ever happen. The plot twits are totally foreseeable and not realistic and this show is for "blind America".
