After all the hype, I finally sat down to watch the first season of this series. The acting appears competent, as is the production values and direction. But the script... It is inane, makes the Berverly Hillbillies look like the Nobel prize for literature. The pacing of the plot is not just predictable but insulting to the average intelligence. And as for consistency....my grocery list makes more sense. If this series had been produced by British television, it would have been wrapped up in eight in ten episodes at the most. More concerning is the US television obsession with drawing out a short story into an interminable series: a sharper script and production always merits a better audience experience.
