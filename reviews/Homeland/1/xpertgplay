Counting the cultural gaffes in Season 4 of Homeland which portrays Pakistan in a very unfamiliar lightÂ….. 

The US Embassy in Islamabad is unapproachable and even the Consulate in Karachi is likened to Guantanamo Bay in terms of its inaccessibility. To be able to hold a protest outside its gates is something that can only happen in fiction. (Episodes 1 & 2: Pilot) Pakistanis write Urdu in Nasta'liq script not the derivative of the Nabataean Aramaic script, which is more Arabic. And yet all shop hoardings and signs are scripted in Arabic Style Urdu. (Throughout) Its shows people in Islamabad speaks Pushto which is strange and also the dialect used for Urdu is far away from the way Pakistani people speak; It's partly Arabic influenced and partly Indian Muslim' the word for Toilet/wash room in Pakistan is "Ghusl Khana" or "Lait'rein" not a single Pakistani say it "pakhana" ... in fact its an Indian version (Episode 3) Pakistan is quite famous for its bus and truck art and that's an understatement. So the white and blue buses that Ayaan travels in just don't cut it as Pakistani.I'm sure you all can add to this: do we, or foreigners all have to cover their head in Islamabad? And is the view from the Amercian Embassy rooftop really the best? Whatever happened to the picturesque Marghalla Hills?
