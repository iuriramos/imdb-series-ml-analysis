I found this TV show offencive in many occasion, specially against Arabs and Muslims, I think some of the movie plots were written by some "half idiots", for example what's the point of portraying an Arab diplomat as gay!! He was also threaten by the CIA to cooperate otherwise his daughter who studies at Yale university will be sent back home to live a miserable life in BURKA. Is that true? Some reviewers compared this show to "24"? You must be joking? 24 is more sophisticated, fast, and highly entertaining, without stereotyping mambo jumbo , also in 24 bad guy can be anyone including the president of united state , a drug cartels from Mexico or Russian arms dealers I also think Homeland TV show is the "porn version" of 24, I mean what's the point of the scene where Broody and Carrie are having loud sex whilst the surveillance team listening! The capture of Abu Nazir was ridiculous, he was one of the most wanted terrorist, he managed to enter the US after shaving his beard to be captured hidden inside some industrial plant!!!
