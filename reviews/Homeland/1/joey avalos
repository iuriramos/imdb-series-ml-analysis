Spoiler alert......Siiiiiiigh....where to begin? First off let me say that i only subscribed to IMDb so that i could rate this garbage.Homeland is rife with completely unbelievable attempts at realism. Yeah i know it sounded cool and you, like myself, "heard" good things. Well those good things came from morons. Lets start with the faces that clare danes makes, they are so annoying and stupid looking. She is constantly grimacing the entire run of the show-she is NOT a pretty crier also. Her demeanor will make you want to throw something at the television set or start beating your wife. Its that bad. If you can stomach clares' facial scenes and wish to continue watching you'll have to assume that in the cia there is no reason not to sleep with all male coworkers,terrorists and underaged refugees in your vicinity, because there are no consequences; not for clare at least. The show turned into a joke for me when the producers expect me to accept that an illegal prescription dependent, who almost everyday puts lives in danger by going against protocal during operations and is never reprimanded; has a complete medical meltdown due to lack of drugs but then stops her meds and nothing happens. C'mon really? We are also to believe that the cia employs and empowers folks who come from mental wards, that are a danger to themselves. If you're into soap operas you might enjoy this stupid, malarkous content. I could go on and on but i only have 1000 characters. Get drunk and Watch some immature adults play call of duty, its more realistic than homeland.
