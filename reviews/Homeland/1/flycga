What is with people rating this 8 and above - are they Trump supporters. There is not one single redeemable character in this TV SHOW. Nothing but United States Citizens as traitors, liars, mass murders. I am a veteran and I am proud of my service. This series depicts veterans as Traitors, mass murders, killers, terrorist, and liars. SHAME ON SHOWTIME. How is a supposedly "United States Company" put out something so very so ANIT-American. Is this a Trump Professional??? As a disabled veteran this particular TV show caused me a great deal of anger - how could they portray a tortured person as such a traitor - it would be normal due to the tortured veteran to be angry - it is the responsibility of the military to help veterans whom have done 5 to 6 tours in the sandpit being subjected to live fire each and every day of their deployment. I would never subscribed to a cable company that hated American Military Veterans so very much.
