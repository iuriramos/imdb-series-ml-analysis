After watching every episode of every season, I cannot recommend "Homeland" to anyone who is searching for a sober analysis of Islamic Jihad, the goals of Jihadis, and the millions of muslims worldwide that tacitly support Jihad, fund Jihad, and through it propagate Islamic culture at the expense of non-Islamic cultures.

The show goes to great, almost heroic, lengths to present Islam and muslims as hounded, hunted, and misunderstood; a harried, innocent people backed into a corner and forced to behave in horrible ways. Not once is the history of Islamic Jihad ever presented in an honest way.

This show is rife with taqqyia. If you are looking for an example of sophisticated Islamic dawa, then "Homeland" is the gold standard.
