With season 4 I suppose the writers and directors got back to the old style of: 

"let's make somebody do something so stupid that it isn't even on the scale, so that we don't entertain viewers, but annoy and disappoint them, and let's repeat this every couple of minutes".

There were so many wholes in the plot that season 4 really brought some feelings in me to come and mark it as awful. 

Nothing compared to the previous three Seasons.

Seriously, if you are about to watch it, just stop at season 3 and you would have much greater chance to remember Homeland with good.
