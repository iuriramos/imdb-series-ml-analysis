... if by any chance that may not be the case (quiet sure it is) than Hollywood writers have completely lost touch with reality. i would have expect more from HBO, at least to insert the question "why they hate us" instead of just taking for granted the official governmental line that is continuously fed to us 24/7 on the "news" channels...there is nothing here that explores motives and such, just same old stereotypical bad guys... the shows takes itself serious while in reality that's not the case.

the plot from the very start establishes a pattern of playing the terrorist card to inspire fear on its viewers and most important to yet again justify the need for homeland security having a bigger and bigger budget to hunt down its own citizens. 

every character that infringes on your rights as citizen is portrayed in a sympathetic way ( good intention my backside...sure...). watching "innocent" "well intended" Clair character reminds me how extremists the American security bureaus are themselves. for people that do such action as described here (Clair) there is no room for "second chances" when you play with the rights of the very same people you are sworn to protect...who are they kidding?...

if keep in mind its likely propagandist objective you might actually enjoy this show. i have already watched a few episodes and will continue do so but at the same time i keep having ironic smiles every few minutes or so especially with paranoid Clair (if this would be that simple in reality i could actually laugh )
