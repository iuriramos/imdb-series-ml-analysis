I have some points that i would like to tell:(keeping in mind that it is a DRAMA, and that it was MY choice to watch it) 1)The series is good , i am watching season 4, but i find MANY flaws (as seen from the eyes of a Muslim,Pakistani n Drama loving person) in the series like, 

i)The facts , the delivery of Muslims and there actions is completely wrong, and i am not talking about the terrorism, political agendas, differences or things like that what i am talking about is the FACTS like the method of how Muslims greet, how we pray etc. its all wrong as seen when Brody is praying and as seen in numerous interactions between Muslims and other Muslims And/or Non- Muslims. Come on these are simple things HOW CAN YOU GET them WRONG (Islam Being one of the Largest Religions of the WORLD).... it just shows how badly an extremely well written drama can be directed.

ii)The series shows Tehran and Islamabad, whereas i can guarantee you that it's not filmed in any of the 2 cities(or countries) , BECAUSE , the roads, infrastructure, vehicles,(even taxis) are all wrong people are all posers maybe not even 1 percent real Pakistani or Irani people. AND the LANGUAGE, OMG!! no one speaks Urdu like that NO ONE, the URDU is SO BAD that i wanted to throw up, What would happen if a native English speaker hears someone saying "PAALEEESS, PASS me DA SALT, PAALEESS" ...it is THAT bad... 

iii)The director shouldn't be allowed to make such a HUGE mistake again, this is just so bad.The only reason to watch is because of the story, spy stuff, and political tension... but still i would recommend The Blacklist and Person of Interest if you don't want to be disappointed
