Another one of those American propaganda shows. Trust the government, and America is great. U.S. is the only one fighting terrorism etc etc 

I fully admit, never watched passed 1st season, except for a couple of episodes here and there. I can't. The show is horrible. Extremely bad acting and a horrible script coming directly from DOD. I'll probably be put on a watch-list for giving this horrible show a 1, but it does not deserve anything better.

Nothing is good with this crap, unless you like it when war is peace and ignorance is strength. Only mindless drones and fully indoktrinated American nationalists can like this show.
