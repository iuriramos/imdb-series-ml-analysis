After friends telling me to watch Homeland for years ("This is the kind of show you'll love!"), I just started watching the pilot this morning. I gave up after a record breaking 15 minutes. In my brief viewing, I saw her receive orders to "let it go", abandon her vehicle on the street, and sneak into an Iraqi prison to talk to a terrorist awaiting execution. Cut to 10 months later, so obviously no repercussions for her. Arrives at the briefing that only she's always late for - no repercussions. Discussion of how we surgically killed 13 insurgents and found a missing presumed dead American, a win for the good guys...turned it off.

Let's see if I can call the series: Danes' character - seen it a hundred times - the rule-breaking rebel that really cares, very emotional, maybe unprofessional, never listens, never called on it. CIA - doing God's work in a dangerous world. Middle East - very foreign, full of very foreign potential terrorists, the Call to Prayer always in the air. Situations and resolutions - suspension of disbelief required.

How'd I do?
