I really was starting to get into this show, it was realistic and I can see the complicity that is broached in the series. The thing I hated is that every time the blond chic said something, it was prefaced by Jesus Fn this, or Jesus Fn that. I can deal with the nudity because that's a part of life, and the plot had strength and was consistently fast paced enough. What I really couldn't deal with is the absolute extreme pointless holy desecration to this extent, it's almost like half the show is cursing God. It does nothing at all to enhance the plot, it cheapens it. I wonder how many others felt cringed by this. What was the point of cursing Christ?
