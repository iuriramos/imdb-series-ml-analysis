Normally I don't write reviews, but sometime things are so evil that I feel I have a obligation to warn others.

After starting to watch this TV series some thoughts struck me quickly. First of all there is no obvious hero or heroes here. This is usually a bad sign. Often it is made like this on purpose to blur the lines between heroes and villains. In the story we see a CIA person trying her best to defend her country, but the way she acts and the randomly connected events she use to build a case make her annoying. Also she use drugs to deal with her problems. This cause doubt about her character and make viewers start to question her instead of connection with her and supporting her. Is she a hero or is she a desperate lost woman grasping for straws? 

On the other side we have a military person being rescued after 8 year of capture and finally reunited with hes family. Again the story reveal things that make you question this character also. Is he a hero or is he a terrorist?

I will say without doubt that Homeland try to blur out who is the hero and who is the villain. This series is on purpose creating a blur between good and evil. It create sympathy for evil and resentment against good, trying to blame the good for evil happening. This is a typical attack on America where the authors/directors want to get the message across that maybe America is the cause of terror against America. That it all is Americas own fault. I find this thinking among the most evil I know, trying to legitimate evil to happen. Its the same as saying that a girl dressing sexy is responsible for getting raped. 

War is never beautiful, its horrible and innocent people will get killed and material destruction will happen, that's the fact about war. But all this is to blame on the aggressor, not those trying to defend themselves. To try to give blame to those that is defending against aggressors is true evil. It take away their legitimate right to defend themselves. It legitimate evil.
