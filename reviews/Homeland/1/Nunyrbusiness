I am on season two episode eight and I can't take anymore. I watched it as a favor for someone who was in the process of watching season two. I have just learned that that person has since abandoned it. I don't think I've ever sat through a show that is more boring and absolutely full of total letdowns. It is the worst written and the worst acted TV show I have ever watched. It deserves a -10. I can't believe it has gained the ratings that it has. This show has been such a let down I feel like it needs a prescription for Viagra. I don't want to say anything in particular about the show because I don't want to spoil it for those of you who are odd and apparently bored with life enough to actually like it. I've pretty much said everything I can say about the show. It's pretty bad. I have two more lines that I have to write but I can't think of much more dribble for this review. Thank you for letting me vent.
