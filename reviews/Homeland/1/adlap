Every time Carrie cries... Take a shot or chug a beer! You will be hammered before three episodes into the first season!! This show is littered with plot holes! Absolutely littered. The poop they pull on this show would never happen in real life! Brody being able to reenlist after being a POW for eight years would never happen. Carrie being bipolar and in the CIA ,would never happen... Hello drug tests! Attention to detail in this show is absolutely atrocious! Brody was bumped up to Gunnery Seargent after he reenlisted and in season two shows up as a Seargent in his dress blues! Never!! CIA agents with weekly routines! Never! Did I mention that Carrie cries in every episode! If they changed the actress in the middle of an episode in season three I wouldn't bat an eye! Why does she cry in every episode man!!! Drink up!! If you can make it through the first season without puking from all the shots you take or beers you chug from either watching Carrie cry or how bad this show is you probably need to go to meetings!!!
