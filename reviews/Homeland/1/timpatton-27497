complete crap!,when would the Cia be allowed a house in the us to torture a suspect.The Cia have different dept's,no analyst would be trailing suspect's in the us(f.b.i)nor pick up a terrorist suspect and drive all the way from Mexico to Dc in a car alone,right now i'm just watching to see how much dumber this crap can get ,but it won't be for five season's worth!Have to write more .Brody told her he killed the other marine,but when her boss called her ,she said nothing,instead run's to the car crying Brody!It seems like she's the one getting turned instead of him .This is probably how this country deal's with national security after attack after attack and nobody's the wiser.
