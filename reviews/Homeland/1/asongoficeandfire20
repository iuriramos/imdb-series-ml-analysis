Homeland is a show about a CIA agent who suspects that a returning prisoner of war is secretly a terrorist. They are both played well by Claire Danes and Damien Lewis who both carry the viewers through the series. Unfortunately I think that this series may have worked better as a film because it is very dull. A huge part of this series is devoted to how Brody(Damien Lewis) integrates into everyday life with his family and with his newly found public attention and how Carrie (Claire Danes) tries to convince her superiors that Brody is a threat whilst also suffering from possible mental illnesses. Now Homeland is ridiculous like 24 was, it focuses on possible agency conspiracies like 24 does, it is also focused on a particular unit like 24 was, and deals with threats for both terrorists and the agencies like 24 did. But all that aside the basic premise of Homeland is whether Brody is a terrorist or whether Carrie is just mad. This drew me in at first but it never really carried the series very well and whilst Danes is good in her role her character is very unlikeable and reminds me of all the crazies who claimed that the world would die from the millennium bug. The odd thing as well is that I actually route for the person who is supposedly the villain of the tale, but the episodes largely consists of his interactions then flashbacks, whilst his family struggles with his very existence. The whole thing is a complete mess from the start and largely relies on what will happen at the end and leave us with episodes where nothing happens where the story drags itself out. I won't be sticking with it because its just drivel and not in an entertaining way.
