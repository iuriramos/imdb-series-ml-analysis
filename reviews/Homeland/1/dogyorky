What could have been a superb one-off series turned into a pile of time wasting and embarrassing cr*p. The start, build-up and continuation towards the end was terrific. I then firmly believe the producers thought 'hey, this is getting really good reviews, let's extend it as much as we can - don't worry that we've run out of ideas - just keep going...!'. As a result, it became a joke. The last few episodes of this series were terrible. I don't even think the acting is that good - I couldn't believe the amount of awards the program has won! Who's voting? The writers? Producers? Sorry, but this is all wrong. There are far better programs out there that haven't got the recognition they should have and this is the opposite. Don't waste your time on this tosh - watch Breaking Bad for some real high quality acting, production etc.
