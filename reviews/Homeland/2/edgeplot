This is a reasonably compelling modern spy drama focusing on a skilled CIA agent who is haunted by intermittent mental illness and consistently poor personal decisions. The protagonist is flawed (both in terms of the show and in the abstract sense) in that she only appears to have two modes of operation: hard-charging agent, and complete emotional mess, which is distractingly improbably for a person of her training and position. There is some strong action, acting, and intrigue. The supporting cast and guest stars are generally top notch, although some of the plot lines surrounding secondary characters distract from the main story line and spy content, particularly the largely irrelevant explorations of the Brody family dynamics. Unfortunately, the entire show is ruined by ubiquitous use of shaky cam, which renders nearly ever scene - whether action or dialog - nauseatingly and unnecessarily unsteady. Seven stars for action, story, and acting, but it looses five stars for the poor cinematographic choices.
