I originally started watching Homeland one year after it come out. After nine or ten episodes of season 1, I was so bored, I couldn't force myself to watch it any further and quit the series. I found the main character Claire Dames plays to be so annoying, I couldn't bare watching her anymore. Such an annoying character. Constantly crying, being emotional, screaming and being unreasonable. It was like watching an adult act as a 5 year old with a mental illness all the time. She is supposed to be a top CIA agent? Yeah, right. The rest of the series wasn't much better. Boring, uninteresting and nothing really ever happens. Just very long, uninteresting dialogue. Friends of mine however were still watching the show, telling me I quit to soon and things would be better, even great. Recently, I completely ran out of stuff to watch, so I tried Homeland again. Started watching from S2 and I am currently halfway S4. While there were some episodes that were mildly interesting, I find most of it to still be boring and annoying. I'll stick to my originally verdict: This show is slow, boring and annoying. The characters are stupid, emotional and unrealistic. I really don't get how this crap can score so high here on IMDb. Maybe it's because I have watched 24 before Homeland. Not a perfect show either, but it least it was fast and interesting with lost of action. My advice, skip Homeland and watch 24 for a much better entertainment value.
