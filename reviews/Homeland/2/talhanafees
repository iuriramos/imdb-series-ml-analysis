i used like this show when it started but now this show has become manipulative political media campaign just to prepare American people for next move or operations on foreign soil first Iran , then Pakistan and now Syria.. this show is just lame justification of American proxy wars on different Islamic countries. i mean the plot on which this series was started is way lost. Broody views about drone attacks and civilian casualties in them and the emotional trauma of families of the marines who go in missions out of the country. now this show getting worse and worse after every season. Langley CIA headquarter perspective protecting country is long gone now show focuses on just regional missions. Homeland is way out of HOME.
