I've just registered in IMDb to say Homeland is bullshit.

There are too many crickets, every night, everywhere, even when it rains.

The script is unreal mostly in the small things.

Boring episodes and secondary stories just to fill minutes.

Mainly good actors, even if you wish to kill Brody (and not for being a ...).

His wife acts well only when she is angry.

I give 2/10 because at least the 2 first seasons were interesting. The 3rd is boring.

Bullshit.
