I am surprised that this series has received such rave reviews. Damian Lewis was outstanding in the Band Of Brothers. I picked up this show because of his performance in that series and I was really looking forward to his commitment here. I had a very hard time watching this show. I spent two years in Saudi Arabia in my youth after high school and before college and made friends with many Saudis in the Saudi National Guard and in various ministries and broadcast TV; it was during the late 70s, so it was quite before all the Al Qaeda intrigue. Despite this, this show feels and looks false. I'm quite certain this is all somebody's invention and it panders to the assumptions about Arab/Muslim culture and the presumed hypocrisies (the search for young girls to fill out an Arab prince's harem, for example). Yes. This sort of "talent search" may have happened, perhaps still does, but it is by no means, regular and conventional. But this show portends that it is commonplace, which is pretty insulting. To have the US investigator requiring substance abuse in order to stay in the game is a huge error on the part of the producers -- it becomes the crutch that makes her paranoia a big question and undermines the possible truth to any situation to which she may be associated. I think the producers of this show know that they have taken liberties with reality and conjured up a big fat lie just because a naive Western audience won't know any difference. And at whose expense? It's pretty shameful.
