The first season of this show is above average. The actors are very talented and do justice to the roles assigned. The creators of the show however are weak and frankly lack courage. They pretend to take risks with their characters but rely on sensationalism and emotions to fill up the show.

The second season already looks to be going Alias way. The lead character, Carrey is above the law and almighty. Even though she appears crazy, she knows deep down that laws of the land are for suckers and her intuition and love is what's right. If I speculate, the third season is to prove to the world that Brody is not wrong, then fourth will be about Saul, fifth about Carrey herself. Mike has to die in 5th season of course! Nothing will ever happen to the main characters ever and at the end of every season one of the side characters die, who would have shown up out of nowhere at the beginning of the season. 

If you like Alias, Desperate Housewives or any such shows, you might like this as this is far more realistic
