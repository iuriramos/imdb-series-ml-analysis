This is my first review, but i felt i had to question how this show could have such a high rating. Most of my favorite shows have good ratings, and i picked this show because it had great ratings.

I have watched 3 seasons, and I can not believe how bad it is. The main character is completely unrealistic. She has a severe mental disability, treats everyone she works with as badly as you possibly can, she even get shot by her own agency when she compromises an ongoing operation, lies to her superiors and coworkers whenever she likes and breaks every rule and regulation along the way. This show could be good for two seasons if you take out the lead character, but once you reach season three the show is so unrealistic that I can not see any way it could be saved.

I do hope they cut this travesty of a show, but I would really like to know how people could rate it so highly and would welcome some feedback about what people who see the faults like in the show.
