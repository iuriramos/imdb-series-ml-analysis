24 is junk food. Candy, nothing more. Good for the occasional sugar fix.

But THIS show is so much more than that. It's writing is impeccable, its casting (Mandy, Claire, Damian) is brilliant. All in all this is light years ahead of 24. To make the comparison is crazy.

Homeland follows Claire Danes through the inner workings (and I do mean INNER workings) of trying to stay on top of who is trying at any given moment to infiltrate US security via terrorist threats.

She has problems, big ones, that she strives to keep hidden from those around her. But Saul (Mandy) knows and the two of them keep her secrets just that. There's enough friction between them to keep us on our toes. And sometimes enough that they keep from one another to keep things interesting for the audience.

Highly recommended.
