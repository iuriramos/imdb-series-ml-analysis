On similar lines to Sleeper Cell, this drama follows the life of a former US soldier, Brodie (Damien Lewis) released from captivity in the Middle East.

Paraded as a war hero, the main protagonist hides a terrible secret. He has converted to Islam and is secretly plotting to attack US targets.

Hot on his tail is a bi-polar CIA agent, excellently portrayed by Claire Danes.

Although predictable, the first season is very entertaining and the episodes just fly by.

So far, there have been four episodes in season 2. Unless we have a dramatic change in plot and direction I worry for the future of this program. It's slow moving, dull and getting a little over the top.

One episode has an ending with a stunning development early on in season 2. You cant's wait for the next episode. Only to wait the WHOLE episode for the 'big reveal' to be addressed. Badly. You have to wait yet another episode for the 'big reveal' to be addressed and when it is...you are completely let down.

After that, I'm not too sure I want to continue watching.

All in all, a very good first season (where I believe the show should have ended if done correctly) and a sluggish second one so far.
