Series cinema is created to entertain and keep it's audience over a period of time. It may be to educate, but mostly it wants to keep the viewer coming back. Zombies, spy's, nerds talking about nothing while eating takeout, period stuff both glamorous and bloody, and on and on. Oh, yeah, don't forget the SUPERHERO! 

In the old days, Lucy, Beaver, Father, taxi guys, Seinfeld, Gunsmoke, Bonanza, Little house, and many more. We didn't criticize the REALITY OR THE VALIDITY OF THESE SERIES, but it seems a lot of reviewers are not happy with HOMELAND. Not real enough.

To even imagine putting together such a work is amazing. To shoot it, after casting, location, scripting, and getting any cohesive, ongoing plot driven series that can be presented to the viewer is incredible. Sure, this one reaches, but where does it take us? As a work of entertainment, this series was huge. Whoever was involved should be so proud of the work. Amazing. Far more complex and detailed than what is obviously swallowed by the public. Game of Thrones, yeah, wow. Homeland can't be judged by it's similarity to reality. Do you really know any more about covert action than you know about how to feed a dragon? Want real political fantasy, watch the debates and read the news.If you haven't seen Homeland, just sit back and enjoy. It's amazing work.
