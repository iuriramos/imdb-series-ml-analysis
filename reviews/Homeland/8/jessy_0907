I just started this show after Breaking bad finished and yes, I'm emotionally empty and still attached to breaking bad. So after it finished I wanted a series that could at least measure up to the AMC's dark drama. Sadly, Homeland does not measures up.

I'm not saying homeland is a bad TV show, it's good. Actually, it's really good; I may say is one of the best TV shows that are airing nowadays. It's catchy, really catchy and I think they have really good characters (complicated, twisted but most of all every character is HUMAN) The problem I have with Homeland is that I'm concerned for the long run, I don't think this will be a good show in the long run, I think it will decrease its quality. I hope I'm mistaken because I really like it. The first season was great but still, there's something missing.

I hope the producers don't prolong this TV show with nonsense plots because it could be a memorable show if it's handled the right way.
