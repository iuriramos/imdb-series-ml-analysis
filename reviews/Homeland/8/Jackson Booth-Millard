I should say that I normally would not watch a lot of political dramas, and I have been disappointed trying the first episode of American dramas, like Dirty Sex Money and The Event, all which did go down in ratings, but as I got into this one I was pleasantly surprised. Carrie Mathison (Golden Globe winning Claire Danes) is the CIA operations officer who suffers bipolar syndrome and is on probation for unorthodox work in Irq, so she has been reassigned to Counterterrorism Center in Langley, Virginia. Nicholas Brody (Golden Globe nominated Damian Lewis) is the U.S. Marine Sergeant who has returned home after eight year in captivity in Al-Qaeda, where Carrie was warned that an American prisoner had been turned, and she is convinced that it may be him. As the series goes on many twists and turns come along, Brody trying to settle back into civilian life after his wife Jessica (Morena Baccarin) has an affair with friend Mike Faber (Diego Klattenhoff), and his children don't remember him well, and Carrie trying to counteract terrorist plots on the country with the help of Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), the only person she can trust. Also starring David Harewood as David Estes, Jackson Pace as Chris Brody, Morgan Saylor as Dana Brody, Hrach Titizian as Danny Galvez, David Marciano as Virgil, Navid Negahban as Abu Nazir, Chris Chalk as Tom Walkerand Jamey Sheridan as Vice President William Walden. The cast is terrific and give all their characters distinct personalities you can empathise with as well as be unsure of, the series brings a good fresh vision of how America fears attacks or terrorism, as well as seeing how it may be created, I admit it gets complicated at times, but when you have explosions, fights, suspicious activity, distinct characters that are good, empathetic, bad and suspicious, it all adds up to a rewarding watch, a great thriller drama television series. It won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series - Drama. Very good!
