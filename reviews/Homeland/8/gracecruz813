never written a review. never had to. but this bugged the hell out of me so i felt like i had to. the show is great except for one thing: Claire Danes. never really liked her so she ruins the show for me. shes an ugly crier which makes scenes unbearable to watch..for me at least. my husband and i cannot STAND her. yes, she plays crazy very well but damn. i so hoped that after season one or two..forget which season she had her breakdown i hoped she was written off. unfortunately that was not the case, needless to say i was VERY disappointed.

but it is a great show. the acting is good and the storyline is interesting.
