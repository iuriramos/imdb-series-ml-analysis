This is one of the shows I've been watching and really like so much. The story since season one is well written and the suspense reminds me of "Prison Break".

Now Brody is dead. If he doesn't magically appears in the next season, I think I'm going to stop watching the whole show. He is a major part of the show since the beginning and without him the whole idea of the show is going to change. Writers always manage to add twist to the story so he gets to be alive again or Iranians might do fake his death so they can turn him back against the US.

The first episode of the next season is going to uncover new things. And as I said, if I don't see him going back to the show, I'll find another show to watch.
