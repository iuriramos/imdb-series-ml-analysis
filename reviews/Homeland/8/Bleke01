Seeing the third season for the first time, the episodes left me with little, and I was both confused and disappointed. The portrayal of Sgt. Brody from the always brilliant Damian Lewis was gone, and we were left with the Brady bunch. Not a typo!

Xander, I believe said it best. The son is like a boy scout, and the mother has a milf-thing going for her, and Dana is just non-descript, being a part of the perfect family. And the ever annoying Maverick Mike gets somehow involved in this. How ever as the season progress we see less and less of time, and we got more and more of the taste of the CIA.

The continues questions of who is a traitor, who is on whose sides, and how USA is going to stop terrorist gets toned down. I guess the show started to become more like how the intelligence business is in some state of a normalcy. We get to see more of the inner workings of the CIA, and we see how they work, and how they try to get result.

This is a totally new sight for the show. Everything started and ended with Brody before, now the entire world seems like a part of the puzzle, and the picture is much bigger. Up and till a certain moment the season was just great. Great suspense, drama and tension like ever before. The plan Saul initiated from the get go, seems like the move that Alex Gansa made. Homeland is going to change, quite radically, and I don't remember a main character being killed off so unsurprisingly and yet so dramatic and so crucial to the story.

I feel being trapped like Javadi, not unable to get away from the strong grip from Saul/Gansa that just can't say anything else that the season just turned out to be great.
