This is a great show and I anticipate each new episode. What I don't like about it and why I only gave 8 stars is the fact that there does not seem to be some sort of closure at each episode ending. Or worse yet, the bad guys always seems to win. I like the anticipation of the next episode, but the sour taste left from the previous episode where the bad guys always seems to win makes me wonder why I watch this? HA! Guess that is the hook....eventually the good guys would win...right? As for the philosophical question on who is good and who is bad....well that seems obvious. The good guys are the Marines, the CIA trying to prevent the next terrorist attack, the US people. The bad guys being those who want to kill in the name of God. Anything else presented in the show is just subterfuge. The writers of the show try to get you to feel for the extremists and understand their cause as just. At times I can sympathize but how can that be when the extremists kill without consideration who dies? And they justify their killing in the name of God. I thought God loved everybody! Maybe I heard wrong. Hence my frustration with the show constantly portraying the bad guys winning at every turn. But I like it and I give it 8 stars for frustrating me, entertaining me and making me think. Otherwise....sure would like to see the good guys win at least once! LOL
