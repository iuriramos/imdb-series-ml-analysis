Very interesting plot, so far.

However, three things really bother me about the plot in season one. The first issue involves the reveal of the Carrie Mathison's manic - depressive disorder. I do not believe anybody having this disorder no matter what level of severity, would be able to get and even keep a security clearance, especially withing the C.I.A. 

I am for patriotism, the military and protecting democracy, but I do not believe that a former P.O.W., in these times, would be given instant access to C.I.A. assets and sensitive information without a long period of vetting and earned trust. 

Also not sure how the Nick Brody can survive into a second season of episodes if he goes through with the assassination or any reference to the plot without having immediately alerting America to this plot upon release from detention. Surely any attempt would most likely imprison him in jail or a psychiatric hospital and kill any chance he would have of access to any access to the C.I.A etc.

Maybe the season 2 plot could have Nick Brody going rogue and continue the assassination plot or something similar in a covert manner. This would be interesting to me.
