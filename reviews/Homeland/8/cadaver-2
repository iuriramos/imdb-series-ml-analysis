Claire is too much EMO about everything, and over-acts otherwise great show

Claire Danes, whose work to date I admire, acts like a ditz who has had too much caffeine and is not convincing as a high-level CIA operative.

Her over-acting is painful to watch. 

Had she actually behaved like this while on duty in Iraq she probably would not have lived to tell about it.

The character of "Saul", played brilliantly by Mandy Patinkin Damian Lewis is a strong candidate for best male actor in English speaking countries today. If you've not seen him in Life, you are missing not just consistently excellent performances by him
