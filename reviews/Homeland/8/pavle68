3rd season finished... Kind of like these 12 episode season, more episodes would definitely have ruined it. And yes, this show have plot holes, some deus-ex solutions which annoys, but it is still action and drama packed worth watching. It is not a typical US show due to its Israeli original idea and co-authors, which is a plus cause it brings out characters and situations that are more believable. I would like it to be more drama and less action though, would have been a true masterpiece, but then it probably would have not lasted for more than 1 season due to bad TV shares.

Lewis is brilliant as always. Danes also, I don't find that she is overacting (bipolar thing wasn't necessary though), Patinkin could have added more depth to Saul, but the girl who plays Brody's daughter is an absolute acting gem.

Anyway, I hope that the authors will maintain their course in next season. I also hope that they will recognize the moment when to finish it.
