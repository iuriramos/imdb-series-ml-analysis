When I came across Homeland I was looking for something similar to 24h which I've just finished recently. I want just to say a few general things about this TV series, as far as I see it from episode 4. I must say, I'm impressed by characters' depth and acting.Both Claire Danes and Damian Lewis play really well, having some very convincing performances. The screen play is also well written and has credibility BUT.... In the first 4 episodes nothing really happens, not even scratching the surface of the upcoming plot.We still don't know who is involved, what are they planing to do, what is the actual target,etc. I'm sensing an overstretched TV series in similar fashion with 'Lost' where, it always took them 3-4 episodes to reveal something.

If you are happy with that, the movie is brilliant. I guess it's a matter of taste in the end. I am now closing to the last episode of the series and I've got the feeling we'll be left with our mouths open waiting..But nonetheless it's a good TV series.

Enjoy watching it!
