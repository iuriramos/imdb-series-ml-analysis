The problem with bringing Holmes into the modern era is that we have technology that makes crime solving a lot easier and his skills of deduction less impressive. And with that modern technology, the police are capable of coming to many of the same conclusions--just not as quickly. So, the show decided to make the cops and medical examiners around Holmes that much dumber in order to make him seem that much smarter. If SHERLOCK were the only crime drama on the air, it would be okay. But unfortunately for SHERLOCK, we have A TON of crime dramas on TV, so fans of the genre are well-versed in TV forensic procedure. Even the dumbest cops and medical examiners on those other shows are smarter than the cops and medical examiners on SHERLOCK. And that really frustrated me while watching the series.

I also found the Holmes character a little too mean spirited (even for Holmes) in the first episode. Although he does calm down a bit for the other two episodes, I never connected with the Holmes character. And this could be my least favorite portrayal of the character (my favorite being by the late and great Jeremy Brett). 

I have other plot-specific gripes with the series, but I will refrain from spoilers.

Out of love for Sherlock Holmes, I watched all three episodes, hoping it would get better. I was sorely disappointed.

Bringing a Holmes-type character into modern times is tough, but it is possible to do it without making everyone around him morons (see House, Monk). So, specific plot points aside, the dumbing down of the cops and medical examiners around Holmes was the biggest problem I had with the series.
