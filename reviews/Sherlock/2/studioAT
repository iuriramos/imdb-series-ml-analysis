Don't get me wrong, Sherlock is well written and well acted.

But, does it deserve all the hype? In an age where TV has never been better the temptation is to class everything as a 'modern classic' and for me that is where Sherlock has been placed.

I think the original novels and short stories give a much better take on the character and although the creative team have gone to great lengths to modernise the stories, sometimes things are best left alone.

I can't say I care for Cumberbatch's performance as the lead either and feel that he is often upstaged by the always excellent Martin Freeman.

The BBC will milk this for all its worth and the legions of fans will lap it up. Best of luck to them.
