I watched the three episodes of Sherlock recently and thoroughly enjoyed them. The BBC updates the famous Conan Doyle creation to 2010 very well.

Benedict Cumberbatch plays the great detective as a young, hyper intelligent and rather unpleasant man. His powers of deduction are as brilliant as you would expect.

Martin Freeman plays an interesting Dr. Watson. He is a war veteran who the viewer can empathise with as he is fascinated by Holmes' abilities while being flabbergasted by his rudeness and lack of social skills.

The first episode sees Holmes and Watson meeting and solving their first case. Episode two features another intriguing case. Episode three is probably the highlight of the series and has a great climax with Holmes coming face to face with his nemesis, whose presence had been hinted at in the previous episodes.

A welcome addition to the long line of well acted, well written and well produced BBC dramas.
