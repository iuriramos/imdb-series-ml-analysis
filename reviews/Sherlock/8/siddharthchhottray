Performances are outstanding. Too many twists and turns. Viewer tends to stay hooked. Many whistle inducing dialogues. Excellent background music. My only problem is with the pace. The same episodes could have been 60 minutes long. I get bored at times but there's feeling of awe after every episode or season. 10/10 for the direction, performances. But overall 8/10 for the pace, as it gets very boring at times.

The other thing that I liked about this series is that every season ends on a high note. I am looking forward to Season 4.

Hats off to Benedict and Martin who play the roles of Sherlock and Dr. Watson flawlessly. I believe I am slowly getting addicted to the character 'Sherlock Holmes'. Some things are meant to remain eternal, and 'Sherlock Holmes' (not only this TV series) is one of them :)
