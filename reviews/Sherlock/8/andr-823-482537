At first, I was a bit surprised to see modern Sherlock Holmes. Well, we all know the classics and it's really hard to move the characters a century forward without losing the touch with the ground. Congratulations to the screenplay writers! Some minor flaws (do you really think modern Sherlock would beat the corps not just read the book?) but some good ideas, like smartphone replacing the watch.

All in all, is it must to see, especially for the dyslexic generation - very good adaptation for those who never would read these books. For others, who have read them, it is a good example how to use the classics and bring it to the modern time.
