I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan. And Agatha Christie.. For 50 years. I know the stories. I can anticipate the reimagined ones. Even Sherlock. I knew what was going to happen. Like Alice, you know the story it's the way it cinematically presented that matters. The Sherlock writers had painted themselves into a corner. It was clear from the start it was a dream/memory house adventure. It's clear all heroes only exist because of the villains, basic principle. Even their own villains/demons, I.e. Batman. It was fun, including the spiralling ending. But where can it go now? That's the problem. They'd really better off not doing more serials, just occasional specials. And not many. And do not bring Moriaty back.
