Overall, this show is really well done, and I have really enjoyed it.

I love the actors; I think they are all great fits for their characters. Benedict Cumberbatch especially does an amazing job as Sherlock. The stories are interesting, the cinematography is great, etc. 

But having to wait years for three new episodes is what kills me. I have completely lost interest in this show after waiting for so long. Some shows take half a year off between seasons, but this is just ridiculous.

I don't think I'll be watching the next season, or the Christmas special.
