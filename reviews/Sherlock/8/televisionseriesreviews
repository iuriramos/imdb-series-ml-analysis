There's no need for an introduction to Sherlock Holmes, everyone knows who he is and what he does, but this show adds a modern twist to these always intriguing stories.

Since the story is set in present day, all the modern high tech gadgets are available for Sherlock, and he makes good use of them. I also like the style in which this series is shot, I found it rather unique and suitable for the genre.

Benedict Cumberbatch, as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman, as Dr. John Watson work very well together to create that contrast of characters, which of course contributes immensely to the show's success.
