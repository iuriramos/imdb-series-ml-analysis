I am a big Sherlock Holmes fan, but I was a bit skeptical about bringing the character to the 21st century. When I decided to watch the series, I was afraid it would disappoint me. The Pilot was a very good surprise, and the following episodes were able to keep up. The chemistry between Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman is excellent, and their characterization of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson was much better than that of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. The plots are full of mystery and humor. The show is not perfect, however. Some episodes, such as the pilot, entitled "A Study in Pink" were supposed to allude to actual Sherlock Holmes novels ("A Study in Pink" is an allusion to "A Study in Scarlett") but were actually completely different stories, with very few similarities. Also, Andrew Scott's performance of Moriarty is, in my opinion, terrible (although it might not be the actor's fault) and the character, supposed to be an element of suspense, became a comic feature. All in all, a great series that I really recommend
