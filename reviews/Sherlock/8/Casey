Though I enjoyed binge-watching the episodes on Netflix, they are not overwhelmingly surprising, particularly since I was such an avid fan of the books as a young boy and read all of the stories and short stories.

However, I couldn't help but fall onto the band-wagon and enjoy Cumberbatch and Freeman's performances as Holmes and Watson respectively. Even more so than Cumberbatch's performance of the self-described sociopath genius who wields his powers of observations and deduction for the forces of good, I enjoy Freeman's portrayal of Watson as a true "everyman," a solid foundation for the fantastic stories that unfold around him, much like Watson the narrator and participant in the original stories.

The show's modern twists are rather enjoyable, such as Holmes' use of a cell phone to help bridge the gap between the original stories' portrayal of Holmes' massive memory and intellect and current technology's ability to let the average person find just about anything via the Internet.

I believe that as long as the viewer detaches themselves from expectations- much like I believe one should for any viewing experience- they can revisit the world of Holmes with renewed wonder.
