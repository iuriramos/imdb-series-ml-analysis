Season 3 was a temporary (explained later) departure from the style of the first two seasons.

Season 3 essentially inverted the 'plot lines' of the previous 2 years. In Season 3, the writers chose to explore the social life and personalities of Sherlock and Watson outside the main story line of criminal investigations. Restrained helpings of detecting villains were served up as side dishes.

This departure took some courage on the part of the writers and BBC. They would be fully aware of the reaction of the market demographic who adhere to the 'Don't Make Me Think' paradigm and prefer factory made, formula instalments year after year.

A good deal of credit also goes to both Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman for not becoming the typical self important Hollywood style twits. Their sojourn into Stat Trek and the Hobbit has refined their remarkable skills as actors. To see what I mean, turn the sound off and play the last chapter of Episode 3. It is easier to believe that that chapter is an excerpt from a documentary rather than actors acting.

While so much time and effort went into revealing the personalities of Homes and Watson, criminal investigations were not totally sacrificed. Charles Augustus Magnussen, acted so capably by Lars Mikkelsen, was perhaps the most evil character I have seen on the movies. Unlike Moriarty who resorted to the traditional thugs, guns, bombs, and other conventional forms of mayhem, Magnussen was an emotional and psychological sadist whose greatest pleasure was in grievously humiliating his victims. Those scars run deep and never heal. Lars Mikkelsen delivered a chilling and dire performance of this truly appalling individual.

Spoiler alert: the final scene of the season shows shows that maniac Moriarty with an "Miss Me' tag. For me, that signals a return to the story lines of Seasons 1 & 2.
