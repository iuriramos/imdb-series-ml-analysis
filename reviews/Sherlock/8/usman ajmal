I think this is a great series but I cannot understand why this is rated higher than the original and the most definitive Holmes by Jeremy Brett. This modern take will after a few years become irrelevant to the new generation but the original will always remain superb. In my opinion this is definitely a great redo, but not better than Jeremy's.

For those who are watching this but have only seen recent movies will be pleasantly surprised because this is way better than the movies. Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Sherlock and he does an amazing job. Please don't let my earlier comments discourage fans of Jeremy's version to stay away as this is one performance you don't want to miss, as a matter of fact you will relive the excitement thoroughly.
