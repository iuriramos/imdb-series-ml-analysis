This TV adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work of genius "Sherlock Holmes", in-cooperates plots from the classical stories, in an unexpected good modern interpretation. The structure of the stories (we will see more as the series goes on) and the characters are transported well into the 21st century and the acting is not bad at all.

I can imagine that many people will think that this show came about, because we just had the (maybe debatable) pleasure of watching a very different movie adaptation just a year ago, but the only connection I could find - aside from the wilder hair - is the occasional musical inserts. They do sound a bit like the movie soundtrack. But it works quite well and help reminding the viewer of 19th century origins without detachment from the modern stetting. Apart from that and the obvious connection through the story, they have nothing in common.

One of the elements which seem odd is the visual inserts, that offer more information to the scene. It gives the viewer the possibility to see a scene from Holmes' point of view. I say odd, but not bad. While they could be more imaginative, it still works out fine.

The show could use a little bit of a lift, maybe a bit of a humorous touch - the original Holmes was filled with witty, often underlined critical and a dark sense of humor (quiet radical for its times) - and while there are hints of that, it seems to be too low. There are sequences you may wander off with your thoughts and that is never good for moving pictures.

I am eagerly awaiting the next episode and look forward to some growth.
