My mother got me hooked on Sherlock just as she was finishing season 2 on Netflix...regrettably, however, the first episode I saw was Reichenbach Fall. Not exactly the best place to start...but alas.

I digress. Sherlock is a brilliant program and is highly faithful to the original Conan Doyle works, however there are a few glaring differences which a Book Sherlockian like me might find a tad irritating.

Part from those few odd differences, the show is delightful and Cumberbatch rivals Jeremy Brett in his fantastic portrayal of the original and best (and possibly still the only) consulting detective. Freeman is probably my favorite Watson to date, and the other supporting characters are marvelously played.

The plots always contain numerous unexpected twists and turns, and plenty of sharp wit to lighten the mood. 

Overall, I give sherlock 8/10 stars. How could it receive the remaining two? Firstly, stay obscenely close to the original stories. That means essentially taking the Conan Doyle books and modernizing the dialogue and such. 

Second, make more than just three episodes per season!!!
