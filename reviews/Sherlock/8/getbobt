Half way through the first episode, I had laughed and smiled a dozen times and had to admit to myself, "I already like this". All of the main characters are so interesting and fun to watch. Hats off to Martin Freeman whose facial expressions are clear enough to be seen while subtle enough that no one would notice unless they were staring (which is exactly what you do). Benedict Cumberbatch is an odd bird with piercing eyes and a peculiar manner that makes one think of an advanced race of brilliant aliens, and this one is pretending to be human, and in a strange sense, isn't that exactly what Holmes must do. The overall story in the first was pretty good, not great, but the acting, character development and dialog were so good, it made this one just plain fun to watch!
