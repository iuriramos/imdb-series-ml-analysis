I grew up in the era of Basil Rathbone as "Sherlock Holmes" but was much too young to appreciate it and never grew fond of it. I became a fan of "Holmes" when Jeremy Brett played the role in the early 80s (when I was a teen) and I never believed that anyone could top Brett's interpretation.

But, I'm really surprised to find that I like this modern/updated version of "Sherlock Holmes" and Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal.

I hope to be treated to many of years of these performances, but alas, that certainly won't be the case -- "Elementary my dear, Watson".

I just hope to get a dozen or so eps. That would be fine indeed!
