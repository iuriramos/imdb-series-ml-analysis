After all these great honors, spectacular reviews and messages we lost 1,5 hour watching this thing. I really don't know what's wrong with you people!Let's get started... English humor,maybe the worst globally,and this TV series just confirms it.No imagination, just flat bad jokes.OK it's not a comedy so let's move on but a negative aspect is already present. We see Sherlock(i use we cause we were 3 friends seeing this thing) and it's a really nice scene while he extracts clues concerning the crime.And for the rest of the episode he does exactly the same thing over and over again. With the same style, same expressions,speaking fast etc.etc. .The bad thing is that giving to a role a so strict personality makes the series and the character monotonous. Really bad try to reach American TV series that lack neither imagination, nor variety of expressions and depth in characters. However this thing is a great characteristic of how people in UK are. Don't waste your time.And American people please stop feeling that awe when you hear someone speaking English. It's so Overrated.
