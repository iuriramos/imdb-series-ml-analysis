It all started quite good - first episode was really interested, second and third - not so much. Second season was much worse though. Typical for Moffat idiotic behaviour of main characters (like in his Doctor Who episodes), typical for Moffat overcomplicated plots that serve only showing his own ego, and typical for Moffat last episode which was a copy of Doctor Who storyline in last season of Doctor Who: 1. Say to the viewers main hero is dead. 2. Make a whole episode of nonsensical story line where villain is making elaborate and stupid plot to kill main hero, 3. Main hero "dies", it is shown with all detail, 4. Everyone mourns main hero., 5. Main hero is alive at the end of the episode because he faked his own death to hide himself from everyone.
