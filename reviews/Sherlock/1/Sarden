I don't know whether to laugh or cry knowing that dozens of adult human beings with cognitive capabilities must have invested hours and hours of their lives making this stuff.

Episode 1 was contrived, had several plot holes and seemed overacted. So I left it there, until months later when a friend, whose opinion I respect, told me she actually watched the show and liked it.

So I fired up episode 2 and half an hour later found myself staring at the screen in disbelief. I probably drooled a little as I think I was, for a while, completely mesmerised by the new standards for juvenile drivel that was being defined in front of me.

The plot holes were piling up, building a mountain so tall nothing really made sense anymore. The realm of the surreal was opening up, and it wasn't pretty, I can tell you.

The actions of the characters are utterly unrealistic. The clichés so bad they become a new sort of meta-clichés. The script and narrative so infantile and unbelievable my 7- year old daughter would find it necessary to turn her head away to not have her little feet curl up in shame. The acting ranging from forced to just purely bad.

There is also very little Sherlock Holmes-style deduction going on here. This is Holmes for the ignoramus of the 21st century. And nothing makes any sense.

And this has a rating of 9.2 of IMDb?! 

I mean, what? People, hey! Don't do this to me. Are you all smoking crack out there? Or is modern civilization truly in the pits?
