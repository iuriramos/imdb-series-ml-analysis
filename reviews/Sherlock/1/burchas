I saw a glimpse of this crappy direction they're taking back on season 2, but season 3 was really the last nail in that coffin!!!

Will not bother with the next season. I can't believe the high praise this show gets these days. Their painful attempt to come across as super smart painted them as super turds.

They stretched an entire season trying to show how smart he is, basically boring us to death with empty dialogs and in the end there was not even one attempt to solve a case.

What a waste of time an money. Stay away from this show, it's a stinker!!!
