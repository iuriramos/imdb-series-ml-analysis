That's what happens when writers reach their own limitations.

I liked season 2 the most. A Scandal in Belgravia was fun to watch and follow. And the The Reichenbach Fall kept interested most of the viewers about next season.

But Season 3 was sub-par if not even worst. You cannot pretend to be clever. Not for long anyway and after The Reichenbach Fall it was obvious that the writers hit celling.

What then? What happens when the writers don't know what to do? They jump the shark they swipe it under the rug. Become pretentious instead of innovative.

For me: season 1: 7 season 2: 9 season 3: 2

What's next? Season 4? Well...to tell you the truth I don't remember how season 3 was ended!!! Oh wait! In the finale season of 2 Holmes was presumed dead and he was alive. But Moriarty killed himself. Yes? Oh wait...Moriarty will return in season 4!

The show not only jumped the shark, but is now searching to jump over the dolphins too!!
