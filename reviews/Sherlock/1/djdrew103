The actual series is great, one of the finest for story plot and acting. Problem is, anyone who thinks people wish to wait a year on merely 3 episodes, and then in season 4 they have ONE episode and expect you to wait a year for the continuing saga? I think they have lost their minds, as people will not pay attention to such foolishness and find something else to watch, merely viewing it "IF" they happen to be on the tube at the right time at the right channel on the right night and in the right mood. Its pervasively ignorant plotting for episodes which makes a person react with displeasure at the mere site of the show, once they learn of the ignorant scheduling. 

Good lord, they use to have Gunsmoke on every week for 20 years with 20-26 episodes straight.

They had Perry Mason on every week unfailingly for 11 years with 30 episodes straight through.

Even Sanford and Son ran 24 episodes straight.

there is no such thing as too much of a good thing in good TV shows.

People like it, if its good, they will watch it like clockwork.

Either the directors are fools or the actors are spoiled. Actors unions or not, we need a good 14-20 episodes if we have to wait full seasons before the series continues. They ruined the whole format by being lazy and stupidly arrogant in the time lapse of the series.
