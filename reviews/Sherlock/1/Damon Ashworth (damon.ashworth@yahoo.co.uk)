I never really liked the prospect of an updated SH but I eventually, due to good reviews, gave it a go and watched the first episode of series 2. Within minutes Sherlock sat dispelling potential cases in a blatant rip off, sorry homage, to House and absolutely shadowed his method of sarcastic case selection. Faithful Mrs Hudson is no longer the face of old school stability as she can now withstand torture like a member of the SAS, the police are still incapable and pale faced English gent SH can physically infiltrate a Middle East terrorist cell undetected. Benedict Cumberbatch is too much! it is like watching Alan Rickman's over the top performances in Die Hard or Robin Hood; they worked brilliantly because the films lent themselves to a level of ridicule, Sherlock Holmes does not. Sorry this series is utter garbage.
