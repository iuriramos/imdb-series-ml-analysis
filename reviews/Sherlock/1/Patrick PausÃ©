The actors totally lack any kind of charisma you'd expect from Sherlock or Moriarty, the stories are complicated and boring, this is a sad attempt of destruction of the mythic Sherlock Holmes character and stories.

Sherlock Holmes just doesn't fit in a modern setting. I don't see how anyone who has read the Doyle books can like this series. It's kinda blasphemous.

I will stick to my complete DVD collection with Jeremy Brett, or the two movies with Downey JR. and Law if I want a more "modern" take which doesn't totally destroy the myth. Or to my complete book collection for the true original.
