1- It is extremely slow Extremely slow 2- Boredom is an inherent feature of this series. The episode is around hour and a half, (plenty of time for each episode) sadly it does not utilize the time properly). 3-they way it shows events, It assumes all the audience need to be dumb to believe and make sense of the material they are watching. 4- the genre says:Crime,Drama, Mystery, it should be Drama queen, Fiction, Crime, Mystery. 5- i have no Idea how this series has High rating, i would give it 1 or at most 2. the ending of all of the episodes is rather disappointing and irrational especially the ending of S02E01 and S02E03 and S03E02. The only good episode in my opinion is S02E02. Any ways i don't recommend this series at all at any case to other than children.
