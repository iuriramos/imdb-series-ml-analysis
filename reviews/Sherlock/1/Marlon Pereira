I was expecting so much from this show, but is awful. The dialogs are painful, full of quotes coming from a Schwarzenegger's movie. Also, poor choices of soundtracks. The acting seems forced in every scene, maybe because of the poor script trying so hard to present the characters and be funny, cool, clever..

I only watched the pilot, and I going to stop there. The episode is a hour and a half long, but doesn't keeps your attention for that long. 1/10 for sure. But I suppose that I am the exception, because everybody love Sherlock. So, if you want to try, go ahead, but do not create expectations. I wanted to believe in it, but, unfortunately, I was not able to do so.
