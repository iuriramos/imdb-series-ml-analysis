This was one of the worst British series I ever saw. Trying to make Sherlock Holmes living in the modern times is a challenge, and if executed properly, it would be a great series. 

Unfortunately they missed the mark completely. I can't understand where so much high praise comes from, because the stories are overly complicated, and often they make absolutely no sense. The characters are dull, boring and the worst of them is Holmes. His home on Baker Street, simply does not have the feel of his home, and it is one of the essential parts that define his character. 

The tension build up is just non-existent, there is no character development, and the script is also dull. As for Moriarty, the worst choice of an actor to portray his character, he came out more as a paedophile, and not some kind of evil genius criminal.

I gave it a shot, seen all 6 parts of first and second season, but it simply didn't do anything for me. I give it 1/10, simply for the effort.
