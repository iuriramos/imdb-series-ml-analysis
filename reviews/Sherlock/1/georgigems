I guess I am in the minority here but I miss Jeremy Brett . 

The "New" Jim Moriarty gives me indigestion. He looks like a gigolo from some of those 1920's movies that said the character had to be oily and greasy.

There are some things that can't be modernized, like Shakespeare. Hope ACD doesn't see this from afar...he would not rest in peace. The HOUND of BASKERVILLE really was a disaster, they lost all the concept of the original story. I went to bed after the first 30 minutes. Basil Rathbone 's version is the classic all should be measured against. 

This series is trying too hard to be a hip, modern show. Next , Sherlock will have a girlfriend. YUK!
