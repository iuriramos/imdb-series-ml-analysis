1.) Storyline: No more deduction or way to solves crime, a pure love story involving Sherlock, John and Mary. The way Sherlock fake his death is a joke, involving Molly as the main helper is illogical. She is a blur and stupid woman, which she was tricked by Moriarty once, and Sherlock seeks her help in this important task. Besides, Sherlock uses his homeless network and involve at least 25 people in his fake death - and Sherlock is the one saying this homeless people are the easiest to bribe. Mycroft does not seems to help in Sherlock death, yet he is the 'Government'. 2.) Editor: Overall theme/ pace is crooked, the way they edit does not even sounds logical. It is a complete mess. 3.) Involvement of Personal's friends and family: John's wife and Sherlock's parents. If their appearance help to spice up the shows, it might help. However, it seems their appearance did not actually brighten the show, yet put confusion in this show: This is a deduction shows, not some love story soaps. 4.ï¼‰Give me DEDUCTIONs: Whatever 'London terrorist' that cost the agents life, is a complete joke. Needless to say out of so many people, Sherlock takes several days to find out there is six instead of seven carriages? He is an observant! (Is he in this season?) There is always a 'off-switch' on the bomb? You got to be kidding me! They are terrorist, T-E-R-R-O-R-I-S-T. 

This is all I can think of now.
