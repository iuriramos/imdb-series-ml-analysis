I think this is the worst piece of cinematography ever produced. I wasted ten minutes of my precious life which I shall never retrieve because I was forced to watch this. I would rather be tortured than watch another minute of this awful piece of 'TV'. Benedict Cumberbatch tries to come across as a sophisticated, well-groomed and intelligent individual but his astonishingly bad arrogance is more apparent, the directors and producers chose the worst possible actor for such a role. Martin Freeman, on the other hand, is a good lad and Benedict Cumberbatch owes him a lot for what he is right now. Martin Freeman, I love you, Benedict Cumberatch, I hope you die.
