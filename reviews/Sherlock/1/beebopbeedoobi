This series is one of the most awful pieces of television i have ever come across. The best way i can describe it is that , it compares with the paintings that you might see on the walls of the science departments in Universities. There are so many intentional distractions; from continual irreverent 'quips', gestures, inappropriate dialogue and then a void of generosity, that i think this has to be an exercise to prove that film making is an illusion. 'Sherlock Holmes', as much a part of tradition as you could get, if someone had enough backing, then 'Sherlock' is the perfect vehicle for such an exercise. Either that or perhaps the majority of the public have had enough of being seduced by character acting,and beautiful moving imagery.
