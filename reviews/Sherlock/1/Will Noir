I'm a fan of Holmes series. Always like to watch any films or TV shows. But this one is disgusting. It lacks one of the most important aspects of Sherlock Holmes. The story doesn't make any sense. I only watched two episodes. Whoever wrote the scripts is beyond retarded. Multiple victims dosed with the same drug at different middle of nowhere, the third one even came from the airport, for god's sake. Cab drivers are probably the first suspects. Besides, you don't need to know some passwords words to track someone's phone, just tell the police, then it's done. And what are benefits when two grown-ass men run out to chase an assassin and left the target alone? Other than those no sense, the show itself is full of bad actings. The way they talk and react made me vomit. Holmes is portrait as an ass that cant solve the case but can constantly come out an insult easily. Watson is like a horny monkey, tried to start some awkward conversations every time it sees a woman, I mean it must be really horny for a man to hit on a girl, when hes kidnapped, and not even in a good way. Poor untalented Benedict and Martin, maybe better luck on the stage, thats the place that requires overacting.
