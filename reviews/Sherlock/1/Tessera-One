Conan Doyle would roll over in his grave if he saw this incarnation of his creation. His Holmes was clever, suave, sophisticated, classy, and , above all, a gentleman. This version of Holmes is arrogant, bitchy, impatient, and snotty. A more unlikeable Sherlock Holmes has never been portrayed. I have always liked Benedict Cumberbatch, and he is only doing what he is paid to do - to be the Holmes the writers and director want him to be. However, I am disappointed that he must feel the need to prostitute himself to be whatever his employers want him to be, even if it means to sacrilegiously disrespect one of the greatest literary figures in fiction.
