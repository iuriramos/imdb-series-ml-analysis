Is Holmes a brilliant detective or some arrogant, semi-alien persona who just needs to close his eyes in order to solve mysteries of the world? His eccentricity and intelligence have been replaced with shallow egocentricity and cheep special effects. Like anyone who is into detective and mystery stories would be satisfied with slow motion effects and bunch of mathematic formula flying across the TV screen. Ohh it is that bleeding formula again, and I was blaming the butler all the time! Is Holmes a detective or an action hero? What happened with complex and intriguing plots? Terrorist attack!? Really!? What happened with WHO, WHY, WHERE AND WHEN? Who cares, look Sherlock is riding a motorcycle! And the terrible Serbian accent in the beginning of 3x01 was just too much...this basically underlined the screaming dilettantism of the whole project.
