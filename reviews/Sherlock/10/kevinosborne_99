That place where a character I read decades ago and have seen imprinted in many different guises, some well done, others less so, arrives at the pinnacle. This is simply the best Holmes, surpassing even the fine British television presentation starring Jeremy Brett. My only regret is that I have one lonely Holmes left to watch on Netflix and then the light goes out till, hopefully, another too short season comes along and the magic lamp returns, with the vigor and eccentricities and humanity we might all wish for in our geniuses. Sherlock returns to us that the game is still afoot, that near perfection can be found in the oldest and most worn apparel, made anew with caring hands.
