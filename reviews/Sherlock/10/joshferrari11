Sherlock is a futuristic version of the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson. I wasn't too sure how good a futuristic version of Sherlock Holmes would be. But the writers nailed it! In the first few minutes of the first episode,I was already intrigued by a lot of the characters. The show lets you get inside of Sherlock's head and you get to see what he sees. The acting is fantastic by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freemen.I wish I would have started watching this show earlier. I am always surprised about the twists that the writers throw at you in the duration of the ninety minutes every episode. I recommend this show to everyone. You'll be going on a ride! That's for sure!
