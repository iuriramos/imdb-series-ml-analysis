While i thought movie depict by Robert Downey Jr was great reflection as the character of Sherlock, this one is even better, and by a long margin according to me. the role performed by Benedict as Sherlock Holmes is absolutely amazing, really hard to imagine anyone doing it better, brilliant characterization by him. secondly the fusion of 19 century story line with modern day gadgetry is fantastic, i just hope the the show goes to full distance, really anticipating it. i don't watch TV series except for "friends" which was my last fav, watched each episode gazillion times but this one had me register and review, finally something very interesting on the tele. hope just continues!
