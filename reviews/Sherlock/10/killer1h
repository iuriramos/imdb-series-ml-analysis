Yes this show was done in a manner which can only be described as correct for its time, of course they could have gone with the old sherlock Holmes but that approach has been played out the truth is its much more interesting to see a modern day sherlock and yes this show does provide that hands down and now for the breakdown.

Sherlock Holmes as you might have guessed already is about a detective who works solving crimes but this show has much more then that, instead of just miraculously solving the crimes at the last second it literally breaks down the thought process in real time(show wise). The explanation, in detail, makes it one of the best shows because not only is the plot intriguing, and the acting top notch but, now you get the feel of actually being there in the investigation the entire time. If that wasn't enough they've kept some very key elements, the scientific oddities, his violin, and of course moriarty. Overall there were thousands of ways this show could have been butchered luckily they have managed to find away around them all and make a spectacular piece of TV. 10/10 nicely done.
