I believe it takes a lot of courage to even consider bringing an icon like Sherlock Holmes up to date, knowing that right across the corner there is a handful of fans and critics just waiting to roll their eyes in disappointment. Everyone was skeptical on the idea of a modern Sherlock, I presume. For me, it was just another TV show that I have heard of and added to my watch list. I didn't even think about the amplitude of the resurrection of Sherlock in a modern world. It's always better not to expect anything. And the truth be told, it swept me off my feet. No, not Sherlock Holmes, the character, I already knew what he was all about, but the way the show was produced, up to the smallest detail, intrigued me deeply. Benedict Cumberbatch never caught my eye before, but now I was simply astonished by how perfect this role fits him and how amazingly well he can get into character. Same thing for Martin Freeman, but I have acknowledged him as a good actor before. The show is cleverly made for the public to get into character and think like Sherlock and see what he sees, which is a big plus. It just draws you in. And, apart from the exquisite editing and visuals, I also want to acclaim the soundtrack of the show, which is just something else, it makes your pulse dance to the depth of the scenes, and just forget about the thin line between reality and fiction. Conclusion? Simply brilliant, well written, well produced, I even dare to say ahead of our time. Can hardly wait for the new series!
