My favorite TV show of all time will be Sherlock. It have beautifully crafted plots and crimes; the writing behind it is amazing. There are memorable quotes and brief dialogs, especially between the wonderfully portrayed Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and the nemesis, Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott.) Each episode is a movie (and they're 90 minutes long, too) that will keep you captivated even before the theme comes on till the credits. 

The acting in this show is absolutely brilliant. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a wonderful Sherlock; delivering the mind-blowing deductions with astounding perfection. John Watson, Sherlock's faithful companion, is portrayed by Martin Freeman, who brings out all of his character's differences with Sherlock. The criminal Jim Moriarty is played by Andrew Scott, who plays his character to seem a little bit childish- until he says a line that scares the audience in the best way. 

I can't say how wonderful this show is- I haven't met a person who doesn't like this show! I recommend it for anyone over the age of 12 (it's not very inappropriate, some parts are a bit PG-13, but I mainly give the age limit because younger viewers may not understand what's going on.) Watch, watch, watch!
