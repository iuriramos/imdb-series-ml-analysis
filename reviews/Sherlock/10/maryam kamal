When I fist heard about this TV show I was rather upset. I thought it wouldn't be good at all... But I was proved wrong. Benedict Cumberbatch's Performance was great. Of course after Jeremy Berret I didn't expect anybody to be good for this part. But he did a wonderful job. The story line looks perfect and the creative use of modern technologies in solving crimes is mind blowing. The only thing that bothered me at first was that it wasn't like all other Sherlock Holmes movies, and it was taking place in modern time. But after a few minutes into the show when you first met Sherlock you get used to it and you love it.
