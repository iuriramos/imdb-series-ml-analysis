As a huge fan not only of the stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but also of the portrayals given by Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett, I saw Sherlock. And to be honest, and I don't know why, but I was expecting to hate it.

What a big surprise! Sherlock was surprisingly brilliant, and made my week when it was on. (I said the same thing about Luther too by the way) Why did I love it? Well, it was fresh and exciting not to mention hugely entertaining. Though I have to agree I wished there was more and I hope there is more in the future.

Visually, Sherlock scores highly. The photography is skillful, the sets are lovely and the costumes are beautifully tailored. The music is another strong asset, not just the clever main theme but the haunting and beautiful background music too. I found the stories very engaging, with a nice balance of humour, mystery and adventure, with the reveal of Moriaty both "campy" and chilling and each episode moving very briskly, and the writing is top notch being humorous and intriguing.

The direction is rock solid as well, and the characters are still very likable. Holmes is still charismatic and intelligent, and Watson authoritative and charming. The acting is very well done too, with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman perfect as Holmes and Watson and Rupert Graves great as Lestrade. And while some may disagree, I personally had little problem with Mark Gatiss writing himself as Mycroft.

In conclusion, hugely entertaining and fun take on the great literary detective, and I think it is a must even if you like the stories or not. 10/10 Bethany Cox
