I must say given the 90 minute plots, the initial episodes in Season 1 may have dragged. The subtle jokes, splendid adaption to a modern setting, great acting made me stay on. 

Season 2 is where this show really crosses over and transcends itself to be both thrilling and entertaining. The brisk pace, animations, tight screenplay, excellent characters , plot and acting leave u wanting for more than 90 minutes !

Outstanding !! 

Sherlock Holmes is good stuff and just wish they had more shows in a season and is a worthy modern adaption.
