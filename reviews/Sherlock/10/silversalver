This show is a welcome relief! Intelligent, sharp-witted and clever story lines, directing, and visuals. All I can say is thank you, on behalf of the viewers who want more out of their evenings than cheesy, dim-witted, half-***** portrayals of of mediocre characters. 

The cast was selected perfectly. The writing is funny, captivating, intelligent and entertaining. And the cinematography is exquisite. I can only hope that more follow this example, but also with their own creative savvy.

To future writers, you don't have to be crass to be recognized, just clever and talented. To future actors, you don't have to be without clothing or be insulting others, to be recognized for your talent. The very reason we love this show is Because it didn't succumb to the typical stylings. Just a thing to note... :)
