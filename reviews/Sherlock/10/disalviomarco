A modern re-visitation of the magnificent characters created by sir Arthur Conan Doyle. But this Sherlock is a bit different from the old one: he is cocky, (too much) confident, a real sociopath... He is a "more serious Sheldon Cooper" doing the detective... So quite different from the real Sherlock Holmes... Well, the result? JUST GREAT! The correct mix of action, suspense, jokes, puzzles,... You would like every single 1 hour and half episode never to end. Dr Watson does a perfect couple with this new Sherlock, and the Mycroft Holmes, the older brother of the famous detective, is also very interesting. One last thing: the way the character of Moriarty is depicted makes him one of the best villain of all time!
