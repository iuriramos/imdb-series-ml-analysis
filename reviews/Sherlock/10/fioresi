This is the best TV series I have ever seen. The authors made a terrific job transposing the original Sherlock Holmes detective stories to modern times. I as a fan of the writings, I must say they are in no way betrayed by the screen play. The actors are simply perfect, they are giving their own interpretation of the characters and they are different from any other pair Holmes-Watson. Ben Cumberbatch is my favorite Holmes ever, I wish he keeps doing it for many more years. Freeman is also terrific as his sidekick. This series is thought for adults, though children above 12 years old may enjoy it. I must say that it is not advisable for smaller children, not only because of the material, but essentially they would not appreciate it.
