To be honest, the only reason I gave this show a chance to begin with is because it was free on Amazon Prime. In hindsight, I would have paid through the nose to watch this masterpiece! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are PERFECT as Sherlock and Watson. It's no surprise to me that they've both gone on and done "The Hobbit" (Freeman plays young Bilbo Baggins), and the upcoming "Star Trek: Into Darkness (Cumberbatch plays the villain, John Harrison). Their chemistry is something to behold and the old school stories stand up well to modernization. The scripts are witty and hilarious and the acting from the entire cast is as good as it gets. If I had one complaint (and I hate to even attempt to complain about this show), it would have to be the introduction of Moriarty played by Andrew Scott. It was kind of a letdown. As great as the scene was, I found the Moriarty character a bit annoying at the start and not very menacing. Mycroft Holmes (Mark Gatiss) scared me more in the first episode (Before we knew who he was. I thought he was Moriarty). I warmed up to Moriarty more in the second season, mainly due to the masterful storyline. I still give this show a resounding 9.5 out of 10 though. I highly recommend it to anyone. It is STELLAR television!!
