Jeremy Brett used to be the real Sherlock Holmes. Now I am in doubt. This series is absolutely revolutionary and much to my surprise I accept that this is a present time-Sherlock. Using Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock is 'cast of the century'. His voice is like Bretts', but his character play is so over the top I cannot even begin to explain it. This dysfunctional, eccentric man with all his coolness and intelligence, makes asexuality sexy and gets under your skin, and is so much more realistic than the never ending American attempt to make Sherlock Holmes an action figure. This Sherlock speaks English, he lives in London and even this series' Bakerstreet 221B looks like real life Bakerstreet. John Watson is a brilliant side kick, and as one said, he doesn't appear stupid or ignorant, but bright and helpful. The plots rewritten with a clever hand and even Moriarty had a face lift.

I love this series. In every way worth watching. Several times. I have never before rated anything with a 10, but this does deserve it. More more more!
