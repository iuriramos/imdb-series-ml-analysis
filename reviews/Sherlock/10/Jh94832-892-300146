I have only recently started to watch Sherlock as they have filmed where I work and had the pleasure of meeting Benedict Cumberbatch i thought it was about time I gave it a shot. Well i was totally thrilled, every season and episode brings a smile and a giggle at the exploits of Sherlock and Watson and the new season is no different. A good family viewing show I hope they continue to write and perform this great show. I did read that they may introduce Matt Smith although i think this would be a huge mistake i doubt it would stop me watching.

I simply cannot praise it enough. Keep entertaining BBC you're onto a good thing here without a doubt
