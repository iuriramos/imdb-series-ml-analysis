Sherlock is the best interpretation of the well known Sherlock Holmes series I have ever watched!!!!!! From the very first episode this show will have you on the edge of your seat. It has the perfect combination humor,horror and of course mystery in all of the episodes. The only problem that this show possess is that it leaves with always wanting more.I guarantee that you will be hooked on this series. Sadly, this show stops with a big cliff hanger (Moriarty is still alive!!!) and you will have to wait two years until the next season (season 4)is released :( But because of my dedication to this show I will wait and try and be patient until they release more episodes. Therefore, this series should be on everyone's "NEED TO WATCH" list.
