Seeing this show in it's entire 3 episode for 3 seasons so far, I was amazed at the camaraderie between Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as the two classic and well known characters Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. In the past, I do recall reading about the great detective as a requirement in school so many years ago, but to see this version, I was addicted and hooked. These two tackled a great many cases that made the viewers remain stumped, and, like me, partly detectives ourselves. The feel was genuine, as it kept you attached to the TV more than any other show. For those that haven't seen it yet, please do. Benedict does show his fine acting skills like he has in previous movies.
