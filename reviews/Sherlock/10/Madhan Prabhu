This is the best t.v series i have ever seen.. waiting eagerly for the 3rd season this year end. I hope this t.v series never ends.. and also very eager to see how sherlock will be back after the season 2 ending. Though Bennedict Cummerbatch has been busy with other places where he been casting, he should be more onto sherlock. Sherlock has been fantastic series making him so famous. The recheinbach fall was the best of them all. Though the series is for two hours. i don't mind siting back for two hours and watching the series. The hounds of Baskerville on the other hand has been fantastic. The way the direction has been done is out of the world. Sherlock using the modern technology has been really brilliant. Jim Moriarty is mind blowing.
