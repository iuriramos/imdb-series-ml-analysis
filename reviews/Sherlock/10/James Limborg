This is an excellent television show; Very entertaining, lots of action, well balanced action with humor; The quality of this television show is as good as the films that I have seen in the movie theater. I hope they make 20+ Seasons of Sherlock (2010). Nicely modernized; They have laptop computers in this version of Sherlock Holmes; Sherlock Holmes has his own Blog :-) This modernization pulls me more into the show making it more real to me. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are much younger looking in this television serious; perhaps in their 20's or early 30's, and they joke around as younger adults would, but they keep it clean which is good. Thanks for this television show; It's awesome.
