You may find my voting score rather exaggerated, but i challenge you to watch this mini series, and judge for yourselves.

I am not a hard core fan of the character, so some may not like this modern adaptation. For me it worked liked a charm! The script is written in such way that constantly builds up tension and pace. Location and technology are nicely embedded in the story. Both actors perform greatly as the famous duo, but my favorite episode is the one with the breathtaking Lara Pulver. I do not want to reveal anything, so i will only suggest to pay attention to every detail in this episode (this probably goes for all episodes). The overall result is highly captivating.

I must express my gratitude to the producers because they have not chosen the easy and more profit-driven way to materialize the whole concept. That is, they did not made 30 minute episodes or 20-25 episodes per season etc. Instead, they have given us one hour and a half episodes, and only three per season, so they haven't sacrificed the characters and the plot over costs, budgets etc.

I cross my fingers that the series will continue over the years (a view that Mr. Cumberbatch has expressed in a recent interview).
