I first saw The hound of Baskerville to compare this with the original... and it was mind blowing then i followed all of them.... everything is perfect in this series, writing, direction, dialogs, acting..... The relation with Mrs Hudson is portrayed very well. Some of the scenes are so well written and executed that you cant take it out of your mind like the password of the Irene Adler's safe, sherlock's surprise appearance at the ending of the same episode..... and The Reichenbach fall was totally insane....I have given the DVD to my friends and they are boasting about it too.... now eagerly waiting for the 3rd season badly.... not only to find out how sherlock faked his death but also because this is some great stuff......
