If there is a better TV show out there, I have yet to find it. 

It's very rare to find a movie that combines great plots, excellent dialogue, superior acting, great cinematography, good music while providing a range of emotions from hilarity to fear. It's even rarer to find it in a TV show that through the first three seasons has lost none of its originality. 

To do this at the same time as keeping strong links to the original books is inspirational. Making a 100 year old book series sing in the modern era is quite a feat. 

Oh yes and the frequent artistic shots of London have me longing for a return to the city. Season 3 in 3 weeks here. Can't wait.
