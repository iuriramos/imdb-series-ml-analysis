This TV show really has brought Sherlock Holmes to life in an absolutely astonishing manner. The story-writers have done an incredible job refining the plot to suit modern times. I promise you, you'll never know what is happening until the very end! Benedict Cumberbatch has done an excellent job in playing Sherlock Holmes...I am a fan of Sherlock now unlike never before! Similarly, a great job done by all the actors. Watching Sherlock has also made me want to visit London more than ever. The show clearly has the British touch to it. I also love the accompanying music and soundtrack.The production excels in all aspects, really.

So I know I've been a bit formal in my review, but basically no matter what your taste, you'll love it. And it's definitely a 10 from me.
