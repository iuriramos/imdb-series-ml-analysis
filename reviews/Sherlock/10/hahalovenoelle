if you are one of the millions of people who have read, and re-read Arthur Conan Doyle's classic series of stories, this is the adaptation for you. The characters and locations have been catapulted into the 21st century. Sherlock Holmes has a web site and a cell phone; Dr. John Watson was still wounded in the middle east, but now has a therapist to help him readjust to life as a civilian. But it is still London, and glory, Sherlock is still oh so Sherlock. Kudos to the writers who obviously understand the Sherlock-ian mindset, and wound that Victorian feel through a very modern murder mystery. The result is completely satisfying.

The casting is inspired. The locations are familiar. Even the background music fits. The essence of the Sherlock Holmes stories has been infused into each scene, every nuance of character, creating in the end an homage. Bravo to the writers, and here's hoping that many more productions are forthcoming.
