SPOILERS Man, did I like this episode. This was great television. First of all, I'm not really familiar with the Sherlock Holmes stories. So the ending, at least the part of Moriarty shooting himself, I did not see coming. Somehow I still have doubts he is dead, thats what this show has done to me. However, I don't see anyway he could have faked that. For Sherlocks death, I couldn't believe he was death, and he wasn't. I'm not entirely sure, but I think that it has something to do with Molly. And also with the kid who was kidnapped, I mean she must have seen him if she would yell like that. So in that case, there was somebody who looked like him or so. You could say maybe Jim Moriarty dressed up like him, but still, he is shorter then Sherlock so I would imagine a kid would remind that even under stress. And somehow the biker who knocked Watson on the ground could be in on it too. As far as the hit-man and what the previous commenter said, I don't see the problem, they just follow Sherlock, so if Sherlock can make it somewhere, they can too. I had two other things about them I can't figure out. For one, two of them where shot, but somehow I thought that these two were two of the assassins who would have killed all Sherlocks friends. I am right or wrong. The second thing is, Moriarty said that they only would stop if Sherlock jumped. Oke, I can believe that, but how do they all know if he jumped or not and when to kill the friends? Because only the one on Watson could have seen him jump, and I doubt if they phone each other to tell that it is done. So why did the other two stop. However this doesn't really matter to me. I found it a great 1.5 hours to watch. The acting, the story, everything was right. The timing and the speed of storytelling. Never a dull moment. I can't wait for the next season (if it comes), and I am curious on how they gonna explain Sherlock not being dead. All in all I think this show is "underrated" and needs to get more attention
