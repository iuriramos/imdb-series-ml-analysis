I don't care what my cousin says about how attractive Robert Downey Jr. is.

This Sherlock is so much better. Each episode is great and Martin Freeman shares the screen incredibly well with Benedict Cumberbatch. Their banter alone could keep me entertained. 

What you must love about the series though, is it's innate ability to stay true to the original Arthur Conan Doyle books and be set in modern times. I don't want to jinx it, but Steven Moffat did a much better job on this and Jekyll than Doctor Who. I really wish he would do more.

If you haven't seen this show it is definitely a must-see, so I don't know why you're still reading this review and not watching it.
