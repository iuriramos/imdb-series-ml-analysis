This show will not appeal to the Attention Deficit morons who need to see a fake karate or gun fight every five minutes like the pathetic 'Sherlock Holmes, Action Hero' movies. But it will appeal to those who are fans of the Sherlock Holmes novels, even considering the modern spin. These episodes are beautifully written and acted, Cumberbatch is a FANTASTIC Holmes. Best I've seen since Basil Rathbone. I fully expected to hate this, but instead I LOVED it. Why can't we in N.America make well written, intelligent series like this?

Dr. Watson is pretty good too, Moriarty is a very strange bird, the episode with Irene Adler was beyond fantastic. Highly recommend this series to any Holmes fan.
