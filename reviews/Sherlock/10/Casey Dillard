I was cautiously optimistic about this series, having greatly enjoyed "Jekyll" for most of its run, but having watched the first series, I am completely on board. In with both feet. Up to the knees if necessary. Cumberbatch and Freeman are both excellent actors in their own right, but together they are a force to be reckoned with. Their interactions and chemistry are very fun to see as the competent and wry Watson plays off of the brilliant but completely socially disconnected Holmes. Each episode does well standing on its own and clocking in at around 90 minutes they are each more like movies in a series. The fact that the pace never drags is an impressive feat. I'm excited to have found it and look forward to more.
