I do not give 10/10 to TV shows. They must take it from me by force, They must grip me with the strength of a gorilla and make me beg for more when they end. They must make me feel elated, they must make me laugh, cry, get mad and feel awed by the writers' work.

They do not need to be perfect for perfection does not exist, but merely make me feel an uncontrollable urge to sacrifice my own precious time to tell complete strangers about them.

Sherlock Holmes does all this in spades. The characters are likable and memorable, the villains are delightful, This is the first 90 minutes TV show I've ever seen and the format works great somehow.

As of my writing, there are 6 episodes total and at least 2 of them are absolute masterpieces. Both of them in the second season. The remaining 4 episodes are "merely" excellent.

All in all, this is the best Sherlock Holmes adaptation ever. Better than the originals. Yes, I said it. An absolute must watch, worthy to be placed next to series like "The Wire" or "Game of Thrones".

Watch it and weep with joy!
