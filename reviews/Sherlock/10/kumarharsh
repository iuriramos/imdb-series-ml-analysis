It seems the Britons make it much much better than their American counterparts, as this 3-episode mini-series is way better than the Movie. The treatment of the characters is absolutely new, but retains the old charm, which makes you relate to them even after a gap of over a century years... Sir A.C. Doyls would surely have been amused by this kind of treatment of his character. The soundtrack also sounds really good. And the way Sherlock dismantles the defences of the witnesses/criminals is something you just can't marvel about.

From the makers of Jekyll and Dr. Who, this is seriously one of the best TV serials right now.

Hope they make more episodes after the original 3.
