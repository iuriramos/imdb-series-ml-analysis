Why the ratings star stops at 10? Cause 10 is surely not good enough for this series. It deserves at least 15 stars. 

I'm not a fan of detective or mystery series. After watching Sherlock it became my favorite genre. I've never seen Benedict Cumberbatch before Sherlock. But I can say that no one would be this much perfect for sherlock except him. The plot of this series is so awesome. I like how they put sherlock in modern life. The great sherlock homes using an iphone! Who would've thought that!

I've finished the season 1, 2 in just 2 days. I don't know why it took 2 years to air season 3. At one point I thought it was canceled.Now waiting life for the season 3 last episode. Hope it'll be worth it.
