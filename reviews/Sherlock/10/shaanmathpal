Sherlock Holmes is the most filmed character in all of literature, period. And indeed, most of the time it has been period. Where other classic English heroes such as James Bond or Doctor Who have tied the source material to the times they were made, almost every adaptation or re imagining of the Holmes mythology has stuck rigidly to Conan Doyle's romantic Victoriana.

This is out of respect, of course, but with the latest version, created by Doctor Who mainstays Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, arriving on BBC1 this Sunday, that's about to change. As the pair explained at yesterday's launch event, "period" always translates into serious and furrow-browed and reverential. And this, they figured, has meant the characters of Holmes and Watson and their funny little bromance have become lost in a fog of tobacco smoke and frock coats. By updating the action into the present day, they figured they could stay true to the spirit of the novels.

"If you don't like our version," said Gatiss, "it's fine, because by the time it's finished there'll be another one along." The last time we encountered Holmes and Watson was in Guy Ritchie's big-budget blockbuster from last Christmas. Ritchie stuck to period, but extrapolated a classic-ish Ritchie action romp, full of time-freeze fist-fights, and upgraded Holmes's sleuthery to combat a threat to the entire world.

Moffat and Gatiss have created a modern police-procedural thriller. This is no Life On Mars-style timeslip. They give us the two men and their relationship transplanted into modern-day London, helping a modern-day Inspector Lestrade hunt down modern-day serial killers. But just as "period" reads "reverential", "modern" just as often translates to "gritty", and that's the biggest challenge facing the new iteration. One might have expected Downey Jr's Holmes to be a gurning action hero, but he's such a brilliantly charismatic actor that just by being Downey- does-Holmes, he was immensely likable. A lot more likable, actually, than Benedict Cumberbatch's self-proclaimed "high-functioning sociopath". His characterisation might be more accurate, but there are times when you wonder if you can root for him. The solution, of course, comes with Martin Freeman's understated Dr Watson, invalided home from the war in Afghanistan Â– Conan-Doyle's Watson had also returned from what Gatiss calls "that same unwinnable war we're still fighting today". By the end, their friendship brings in the tenderness the series needs if it's going to survive.

It's early days, but the first of three 90-minute movies, A Study In Pink, is brilliantly promising. It has the finesse of Spooks but is indisputably Sherlock Holmes. The deduction sequences are ingenious, and the plot is classic Moffat intricacy. Purists will take umbrage, as purists always do. But Sherlock has already done something quite remarkable; it's taken television's Sunday night and made it sexy.
