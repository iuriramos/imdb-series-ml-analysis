Watching this makes you smarter!

Not really, but I do tend to notice more in the Cumberbatch-Sherlock-way.

The only disappointing thing I can say about this series is that there aren't more episodes! However, the episodes are 1.5 hours longs, so there is the same amount of content as other TV programs.

With lots of twists and turns, every episode keeps you thinking!

Although I do recommend watching every episodes, lots and lots, you don't actually need to watch previous episodes to keep up with the story. Each episode has its own story, and other than Watson's blog and Moriarty, they are all individual to each other.
