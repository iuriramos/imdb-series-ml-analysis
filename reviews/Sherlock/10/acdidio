When I first heard of Sherlock I wasn't quite sure I would be into it as I was used to watching comedy TV Shows like Big Bang Theory or The IT Crowd. I decided to give this show a go and I fell absolutely in love with it. Benedict Cumberbatch is by far the greatest representation of Sherlock and and Martin Freeman as Dr Watson also. My favourite thing about this show is how smart and witty it is. It hooks you in from the very start and the length of each episode (88mins) is just the right length to go into full detail on each case. I recommend this show to absolutely everyone because of how utterly amazing it is. You will definitely not be disappointed with this show. I do, however believe it is not for children (11 year old and a over ).
