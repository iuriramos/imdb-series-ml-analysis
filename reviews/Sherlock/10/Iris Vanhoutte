Maybe you have already heard about this BBC series that started in 2010. Sherlock, as the name tells us, talks about the famous detective Sherlock Holmes and his devoted friend John Watson. But the storyline takes place in the 21th century and in a very modern London. The part of Sherlock Holmes is played by the great Benedict Cumberbatch and the Emmy Award winner Martin Freeman plays the role of John Watson.

First of all, what I find truly amazing about this series is the acting of the two main actors. Both are astonishing and despite the fact that Sherlock and John are not the loving kind of characters, you really learn to love them, especially when a true friendship between them start to grow. 

Moreover, this series is shaped differently than the others: one season is only three episodes, but one episode last one hour and a half. So, it's similar to a short film. Therefore, each case is resolved at the end of the episode. And I absolutely love the suspense that comes from the research of a case. It is very gripping and you can't stop watching until the very last second of the episode. 

Sherlock is one of the greatest modern series of our time. It completely transports the viewer. You can feel the drama, the laughs and the thrill of the search along with Holmes and Watson. And that is what makes Sherlock an outstanding series and one that you can't miss.
