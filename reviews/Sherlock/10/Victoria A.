Sherlock has never failed to amuse me from the very first ten minutes of the first episode. I had been wanting to watch a really good series for long time, and Sherlock was the best compensation I could ever ask for the wait. 

First off, Cumberbatch is nothing but brilliant. His acting is genius, his dialogues are mind-blowing (the speed of his mind is simply unbelievable), his facial and physical expressions just bring for me the best modern Sherlock anyone could ask for. He just is the kind of person you'd like to punch, even though you can't deny to admire. His acting is just so good that he has become of those actors of whom their real name almost sounds weird in my mouth. Sherlock just suits him perfectly.

Martin Freeman is nowhere behind. Initially I thought that Sherlock was the undeniable protagonist of the series and I was afraid that Freeman was just going to be the silly sidekick. I was wrong, plain wrong. In my opinion, when these two are in the screen together, I don't have the feeling that Cumberbatch outshines him in any sense. Freeman just manages to keep up to Sherlock's brilliance with his character's own smarts and geeky and awkward personality. 

The chemistry between the acting of the two principal characters is undeniable. This, added to the brilliance of the script (some lines just kill me), more charismatic actors, music and undeniably intriguing cases to solve, Sherlock results in a 100% recommended TV series that will keep you wanting for more.
