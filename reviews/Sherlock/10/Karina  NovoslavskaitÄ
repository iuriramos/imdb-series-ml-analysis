I love this show. I learned so much from Sherlock, and can't live without it. I know what it is re-created to the 21st century, but I think it is even better than the original book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. They call people by their names, like John or Sherlock, and not Dr. Watson or Mr. Holmes every time. This Sherlock is a modern-guy, using technology and that's really great. Steven Moffat, Mark Gatiss and the others did a really good job, and I think that most people would love Sherlock. My parents started watching it in 2010 when it first came out, and so did I. It's the best TV-show ever. You just watch it and every second fall in love with Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman's John Watson. Sherlockians are a very amazing fandom, and they are waiting for the 4th season like never before. I recommend this show to everyone who can at least understand English and what is going on on the show. Go and watch it, you won't regret!
