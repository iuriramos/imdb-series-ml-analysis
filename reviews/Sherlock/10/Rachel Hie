Not only are Sherlock and Watson extremely attractive in this version, but their personalities fit the bill perfectly. I grudgingly admit I had some skepticism when I began watching the show, but I instantly fell in love with Sherlock's arrogance, Watson's kind nature, and the plot itself; while Sherlock's working on a smaller case, the larger picture unfolds every so often, leaving the viewer more and more enraptured as you near the end. Easily the best hour and a half you could invest in a television show, and it just keeps getting exponentially better with each addition. I find myself re-watching the series over and over, waiting for the next season to make its appearance.
