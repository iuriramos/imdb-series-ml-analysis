I've been reading the reviews and there is nothing more I can really say. Sherlock is GREAT! This incarnation of Dr. Watson is fantastic much better than a bumbling older doctor of past. Mycroft is perfect, so alike yet so different than Sherlock, I like that there is more of Mycroft's history/background being shown as well. Inspector Lassard much better than in the past all the characters new and refreshing! The last episode has really left us dangling for what may be a long time. The big question is when will they return... one site says a Christmas special and then new season start in 2017. WHY SO LONG? If I could wish for something about the show it would be to have 4 or 5 episodes vice 3.
