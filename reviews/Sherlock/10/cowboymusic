This production is clearly THE BEST, one could have hoped for - really! The dialogs, the suspense, tension, and well written stories - ah.. it makes the difference. 120 minutes storytelling pr episode, told by excellent actors - I did not even look at the watch! The main thing, to me, is the fact that the dialogs sculpts the characters in such a manner that we see a true Holmes and Watson as this TV production highly seeks to shape. They succeeded by choosing an excellent cast! Location settings for the movie has so far been interesting because they've managed to create a fascination of old, implemented into modern day city landscapes. 

Highly recommendable ! This is the real, Sherlock Holmes, deal!
