Clever updating of Conan Doyle's detective to the 21st century. It will be very interesting to see if they can, in fact, do "Hound of the Baskervilles." Both the pilot and the first episode are based to some degree on the first novel "A Study in Scarlet" (titled here "A Study in Pink"). Comparison of the changes from the pilot (60 minutes) to the 90 minute first episode reveal how the writers can create a compelling and exciting version of "Scarlet" at either length. The second episode "The Blind Banker" takes elements from several Conan Doyle stories, and seems more traditional Holmes than the others shown by the BBC so far. The third episode "The Great Game" may finally have surfacing the traditional adversary of Holmes. Or perhaps not. All of these present some of the most intense television currently on offer.
