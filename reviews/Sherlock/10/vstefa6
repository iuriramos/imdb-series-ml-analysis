When I first watched this series, I was really amazed! I knew Martin Freeman from "Love actually" but nothing more. Benedict Cumberbatch though, I had met him in "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" where I had found him a very very interesting actor! Well, in "Sherlock" both are extraordinary! Everything about this series is extraordinary. There such well structured dialogues- clever, sophisticated, humorous! I like very much the fact that they solve their crimes in 21th century. And.. Andrew Scott has been performing such an excellent "Moriarty". He is really amazing. Marc Gatiss, also, performs a role that suits him perfectly. I strongly believe that "Sherlock" is a masterpiece and a sparkler for the, usually too poor to watch, television.
