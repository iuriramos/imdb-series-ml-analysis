Just finished watching season 2 and the season finale touched me in so many ways. We've seen a lot of friendships filled with loyalty, trust and care but it seems that majority of them pales in comparison to what Sherlock and John have shown to us. In the end Watson sums everything Sherlock did in a few sentences and one plea. 

Out of respect for Cumberbatch and Freeman I am not even going to try finding the words to describe their performance. 

The show is witty, intelligent, vibrant, very, very entertaining and executed perfectly. A warm recommendation to everyone who hasn't seen it yet. I really hope 3rd season is coming soon.
