I actually never read the books. I've watched the latest movie adaptations with Robert Downey Jr. playing a more than believable and amusing Sherlock, but compared to this series the two movies feel a little uninspired, maybe even shallow. "Sherlock" has some fresh ideas, presenting Sherlock Holmes as a person living during the 21. century and since the first moment, I've been able to take a peek at the German synchronized version, I felt hooked. Of course (and by old tradition) the audience has no chance whatsoever to solve the case since Sherlock's brain is working faster than a missile aiming towards it's target. I don't want to spoil anything but I really love the way the film-makers solved the problem of showing the world through Sherlock's eyes. In the end - even though you can't point towards the solution - you feel a connection that chains you to the latest case Watson and Sherlock are working on. It's also a pleasant surprise, that none of the cases presented so far feel retarded or even like something you have seen before. Every classic "Sherlock Holmes"-character is present and given a revision.

If you like crime thrillers - and maybe even if you don't like Sherlock Holmes for some strange reasons - you shouldn't avoid at least taking a small peek at the first episode. It's well worth your while and your attention and I alway keep wanting more!
