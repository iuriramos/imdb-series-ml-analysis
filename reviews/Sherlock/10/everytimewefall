I can honestly say that, as a fan of the original works, I was skeptical - especially after seeing so many absolutely horrid adaptations in the past. I was, however, already familiar with Steven Moffat, who is an absolute gift to writing and producing. After giving it one episode, I was completely hooked.The casting is brilliant; they could not have picked a better Sherlock, or John for that matter. There is so much chemistry between them. As I said, Moffat is a true genius - that's not to say that he won't make you absolutely hate him at times! Throughout the series, I was almost falling out of my seat laughing, yelling various choice words at the screen in frustration, and (more often than I'd like to admit), fully broken out into screaming sobs, contemplating why I ever began watching this program in the first place. It is a masterpiece that will undoubtedly bring you on a difficult journey, sucking you into the life of this brilliant man and those who surround him; it will grip you until the very end, and leave you wanting more. Be warned; you will want to watch the entire program again! I, along with everyone else, I'm sure, can not wait for series three, which is in production at the moment.
