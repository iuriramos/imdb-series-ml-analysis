When I picked up on the trailer, I was at first sceptical, at first glance you see a modern environment and noir looking characters and you wonder will they pull it off or will they have scratched the classic.

Well I'm happy to say I've just finished watching it for the 8th time, and I can't get enough of it, I'm now obsessed. The make over works wonders, it throws you into a classic partnership with a hint of CSI. The characters are well developed, but still have some premise and mystery to keep you questioning, especially Sherlock played by the talented Benedict Cumberbatch who is referred to as a 'Socio-path', which adds more to the lure of the sleuth, not only that but he is damn sexy even if the character is sometimes callous, not to mention the casual dark horse, Martin Freeman....who is growing on me.

It has also allowed me to shine a light on actors I have never paid much attention to before, and I'm so glad it was this programme which introduced me, and knowing that the writers of doctor who were the shippers made it magical!!

I will sleep well tonight.
