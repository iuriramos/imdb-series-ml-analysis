I know there are fair shares of people who will look upon a modern day Sherlock negatively. I would ask those to put aside those judgements and watch this brilliant television series. I think the BBC has made poor television over recent years. However, with Sherlock, they have written something spectacular. Sherlock is a sophisticated, stylish series which leaves viewers wanting more after each episode. Initially, three episodes per series would give an impression 'Oh, three episodes... is that it' It is however, three, one and a half hours episodes, which when thought about, is actually a lot. It is basically three films that you would pay to go and see at the cinemas! Some films are not even that long! So, put aside any pre-doubts and sit back, relax, and prepare to be entertained by some brilliant acting and ultimately, a brilliant show!

'More, more, more, how do you like it, how do you like it' SHERLOCK!
