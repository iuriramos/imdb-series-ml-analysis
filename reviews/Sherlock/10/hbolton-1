Superb acting on the part of Holmes and Watson! Great plot twisting. Story-telling is best ever, with words appearing on-screen to let you know what Holmes is thinking as he observes and detects. 

I liked the balance and character development of both Watson and Holmes.

Best of all for story lines, each of the three episodes is: 1. 90 minutes long, allowing lots of time for story and character developments. 2. Each new episode follows the previous one, providing a strong connection between them.

Could watch this over and over again, and see more things missed on previous viewings.

Overall, this is a dynamite movie. LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
