Well, after reading the books (some of them 2 or three times), and seeing all the screen adaptations out there I really must say that this started as a weird take on Holmes and got me bummed after the first 10 mins of the 1st episode ... however, when Holmes came into play all was forgiven and that instantly gets u into the mood of watching the whole thing faster.

Sure there's gadgets, 21st century technology and whatnot but the spirit of Sir Arthur's works is very much alive and the main roles are doing a hell of a job of their parts ... I especially love Watson's take, I kind of disliked the character even in the books ... but over here an adrenalin junkie Watson always on his toes makes this even more interesting ...

Without further a due I must strongly recommend this ... Hell I've been glued to my seat for the 1st 2 episodes without even a smoke, and that's a record even for a single movie, let alone a teleseries...
