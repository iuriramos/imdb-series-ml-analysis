The Sherlock is just simply the best and most amazing series ever. When I began watching this show I had a high expectation from them, because the show is produced by BBC and also that it took the name of a very prestigious icon. The show contains numerous creativity, which in the ordinary life a normal person would not even think of or even look at and these thinks combined with a fantastic storyline can blow anyones mind. The first episode already got my attention when I started watching, because the way they sold the show in the first 10 minutes is just simply phenomenon. Once anyone starts they cannot stop. The actors are amazing as well. Benedict Cumberbatch has a very unique acting style, which exactly represents Sherlock who has a very interesting personality. Overall I would advise everyone to watch at least the first episode and then the rest will just come by itself.
