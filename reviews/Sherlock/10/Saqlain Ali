This is one of the most fantastic thing i have ever watched.The creators have done a brilliant job to bring sherlock Holmes in modern times.The little changes in the original stories(by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)are just perfect as if they should have been like this. Casting of the show is also just perfect.Every actor has played his/her role with absolute perfectness.Benedict is the perfect choice for being sherlock,one,because he perfectly fits in the description of sherlock told in book and second,because he is a damn good actor.Martin Freeman playing Dr.Watson has also completely justified with the character with his good acting.Not just Benedict's acting but the whole cast's acting has made sherlock look perfectly stubborn,careless and full of pride and show off attitude, yet very emotional(specially for john). Every episode keeps you tight and involved till the very end.Music adds a lot to it,it is also very nice. This is one of the must watch before dieing shows.

"Highly Recommended"
