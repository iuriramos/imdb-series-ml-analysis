I am a huge admirer of Sherlock Holmes. Have read almost every novel seen very movie and every series made on this gargantuan character.

Just when i thought Sherlock can't get any better or bigger, BBC came out with this series and i was blown away. Set in modern day London Sherlock becomes even more interesting.

Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock has done an absolutely amazing job. To play the witty yet anti-social characteristics of Sherlock is not easy at all but Benedict has pulled it off with utter ease. Martin Freeman as Dr.Watson has complimented Benedict very well, in fact the casting is just exquisite.

My fav character though in this show is Jim Moriaty played by Andrew Scott and his performance is one of the best i have ever seen on screen. The dark yet similar character to Sherlock brings the best and worse out of Sherlock. Take a bow Andrew Scott for your tremendous job.

Anyone who hasn't seen this, i recommend it highly. Even if you are a traditionalist you will love this show.

I just wish they make an episode every day, it is that good. But i guess the best things always come in limited quantity.
