I have long been a Sherlock Holmes fan. First Basil Rathbone and then Jeremy Brett as well as having read all the stories. However, I have never been a fan of classics in modern settings so wasn't sure what to expect. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the part perfectly. Classic Holmes. In my opinion he even outdoes the Rathbone and Brett. And as a bonus, he is also absolutely gorgeous (in my humble female opinion). My husband, who has never really watched Sherlock Holmes before absolutely loved it and wanted more. For anyone who isn't familiar with the real Sherlock Holmes and thought Robert Downey Jnr was it, think again and give this a go. You won't be disappointed.
