One of the words used quite often in the books the Sir Arthur in his portrayal of Sherlock was "Pray.. continue with your tale". Seeing the series the words that come that are almost same.

What works for the series is well.. everything.

Beginning, you have all characters in their role the way they were meant to be .Well, they use phones and cars and nicotine patches but still the central theme remains same. His deduction by observing wetness of a cloth, or the scratches on the charging point is well in line with the maestro of the 19th century. The arrogance,the intelligence, his lack of social insight rightfully done;nothing overboard.The plots are in tandem with the books with minor tweaking, the solution looks quite real.(Unlike present day thrillers which sometimes overdoes deductions) A master stroke was that to make Mycroft a regular feature.

I now come to two main points why this is much better than other adaptations of Sherlock( all were good, but still..)

1. Moriarty: Its no more a mustache,no professor. Its just a cunning individual who loves to do crime and help others(As he calls himself "Crime Consultant" ) The madness,the dedication to defeat Sherlock just gives chills. (Watch the third episodes of both series to know what i am saying)

2. John Watson : It is always sad to see when no adaptations could handle Watson properly. Either he is a joker, or a serious guy or a war hero looking for adventure. None gave the feel of the books. Forward to BBC Sherlock, Watson is just magnificent.His initial apprehensions about Sherlock,his insight into crime and the improvement in it,the friend that he is suppose to be, the occasional anger at his arrogance all wonderfully done.

All in all a must watch. Perhaps the best adaptation of Sherlock.

N Yeah did i say the theme music is addictive? ;) See it,Hear it. Not to be missed.
