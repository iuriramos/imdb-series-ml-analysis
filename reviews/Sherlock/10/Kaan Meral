When First time I watched this film I was so surprised.

Because My idol Sherlock Holmes was in our time.

And he can use the technology for solving and investigate cases.

Actually it's a brilliant idea sherlock in present.

I want to write about effects,filming and other stuffs.

For example when Sherlock is using deduction on somebody we can see some words around and it's give us some proof about the person who was deducted by Sherlock.

But we can't say there isn't any bad thing about the movie.

Actually it's not a movie.It's a series and it has only 3 episode in a season.

And you have to wait too much for watch the other season.

Between of the every season of sherlock we almost spend 1.5 years

Any way whatever it has bad. it still very nice series for my

There is not so much thing to write thanks for reading good bye
