I've always been familiar with Sherlock Holmes, but only in hearing about the character from the fictional books, and I'd never seen any movie production or television show about him, until I had the pleasure of watching BBC's Sherlock. 

Don't let the 3 episodes a series fool you, because each episode is PACKED with great story lines and moments that will make you believe you are watching a full-length feature film! This show is absolutely amazing in every possible aspect of the word. It's such an enticing show that depicts the younger days of Sherlock Holmes with such a great fashion that it's hard to watch anything else after you've seen it, really.

The writing is superb and each episode has gotten me hooked, especially with the magnificent deduction skills of Sherlock and the useful, more emotional help of his wonderful companion/friend/flatmate John Watson.

The plot is brilliant (as well as the acting by main stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman), and so is the main villain, who manages to be on the same superior wit level as our favorite detective, which leaves the confrontations, crimes, and resolutions incredibly entertaining to watch.

I cannot recommend this show enough and I truly believe that it's one of, if not THE greatest show of this decade.
