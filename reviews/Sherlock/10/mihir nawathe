I forced myself to see this, totally skeptical, after my friend told me that this series was as good as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works. And boy, wasn't he right! Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of the iconic Sherlock Holmes to perfection, and Martin Freeman portrays John Watson brilliantly too. Andrew Scott as Jim Moriarty is arguably the craziest portrayal one could ever hope.

The writing is top-notch, especially Gatiss and Moffat's episodes. The two Thompson's episodes have their flaws, but they are enjoyable nonetheless. The deductions sequences are ingenious and the addition of new twists to the original plots is brilliant. 'A Scandal In Belgravia' and 'The Reichenbach Fall' might just be the greatest TV achievements till now.

Eagerly waiting for season 3, after the ingeniously cunning cliffhanger ending.

Do not miss this one.
