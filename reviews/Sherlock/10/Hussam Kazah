Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes is action packed with very good characters. This Sherlock TV adoption has less action but more wit and better chemistry between Holmes and Dr. Watson.

The only downside is that the season was only 3 episodes. It would have been better make each episode 45 min and span each story for 2 episodes. The fun ended within 3 weeks.

I hope they add more episodes in the next season but from what is available on the net there are 3 planned episodes: 2-01 01/Jan/12 A Scandal in Belgravia 2-02 08/Jan/12 The Hounds of Baskerville 2-03 15/Jan/12 The Reichenbach Fall

Still have to wait a couple of weeks.
