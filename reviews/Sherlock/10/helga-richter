true to the original with a lot of eye-winking, Doyle-humor, two wonderful actors with surprising chemistry, and oh - just so much tongue-in-cheek psycho-analysis with twists and tweaks... give it a try, you might end up liking it. I really disliked B.C. until after the first few minutes of Sherlock. He has the perfect snobbish/childish/arrogant/brilliant countenance for the title figure, with more warmth and intelligence than the US-version, and such a versatile face. Watson also deserves some praise, I'll be looking forward to seeing him evolve. the scene in the diner when they are waiting for something to happen is priceless, and so true. I've read the books, original and abbreviations, two languages at different ages, i own the original series where the grand detective is so unforgettably played by Sir Jeremy Brett, I've seen most of the versions of Doyle's stories that are out there, and i still think this series reaches that original series. Just transferred into the 2000s.
