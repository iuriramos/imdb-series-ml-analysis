I wasn't really a huge Sherlock Holmes fan. I tried to watch the Sherlock Holmes movies with Robert Downing Jr. but I fell asleep within the first 10 minutes. So when my best friend told me of this show I wasn't all that interested. But with her being a huge fan I decided to take advantage of it on Netflix. The first time I watched it I could not really get into it. But a couple of months later I decided to watch it again. And within the next 24 hours I completed the first season, and could not wait for the next. I just currently borrowed it and watched the second season within 12 hours. This show is great and an amazing retelling. The camera work and graphics are movie worthy, and with the show being an hour and a half long, it practically is. I love this show and it was fun/addicting to watch! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
