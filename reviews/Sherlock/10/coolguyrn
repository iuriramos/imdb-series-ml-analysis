This is definitely one of the best Sherlock Holmes TV series that I have seen. Initially I was kind of skeptical on how a 'contemporary' Sherlock might pan out, and I definitely didn't expect a Holmes who uses technology to be this awesome! Martin Freeman as Watson has done an outstanding job. The plots that surround each episode have the class of an Arthur Conan Doyle story interwoven with just a hint of Doctor Who and the right amount of "modernising" that Holmes needed. On the whole this reinvention of Holmes will not disappoint a fan of the classic Holmes and will get you into crime novels if you haven't already read the original series!
