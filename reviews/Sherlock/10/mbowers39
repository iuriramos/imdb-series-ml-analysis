I generally despise 99% of all modern shows and had no interest in this one, either -- I am so glad my very wise daughter forced me to watch it. "Sherlock" as absolutely brilliant on every level: magnificent acting and perfect casting; fantastic script, with great timing and comic flair even while maintaining a rightfully serious tone; superb camera work, special effects and technical wizardry; sensational, gripping plots; and perfect pacing and timing.

I can't wait for the next series! I loved BBC's recent adaptation of "Robin Hood," but "Sherlock" might be even better. Easily one of the top five shows ever made, in my view. It's already in my small-town U.S. library on DVD, so by all means find a way to see this superb show! You will never find a better combination of acting, special effects and script/plot.
