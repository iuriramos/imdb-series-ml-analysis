Let me see where i can begin it from??? Oh, i got it... Sherlock Holmes! Well, what can i say about this... My brother asked me to watch me this show but i ignored him and when he literally started to insist me i said, "OK BRO, let me give it a shot". I never knew that my addiction would start from that minute.. Put on the show and in 5 minutes i was blown away.. Let me get straight you on this (Don't mind if i use the excellent word again and again). Excellent show, excellent cast and every single thing is excellent.. It keeps you on hook till the credits start to roll over.. One of the best shows i've ever seen in my life. Cummerbatch has been amazingly extra-ordinary in his Sherlock role as well as Freeman. The chemistry, humor, suspense, mystery everything keeps you so involved that you forget what time it is and you want to watch more... It truly gives a cherish feeling of WOW, NOW THAT's MORE I LIKE IT!!!! If you haven't watch it then its a recommendation.. DON'T WAIT, JUST WATCH IT!!! I am giving it 10 because this show has become my new admiration that gives me long thoughts before sleep!!!
