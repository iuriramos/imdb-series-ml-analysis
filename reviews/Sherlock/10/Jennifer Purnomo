The title about sums it all up - Genius.

I am a huge fan of the original books by Sir Conan Doyle and I am more than pleased to say that this series, not only lives up to expectations, but far surpassed it. The adaptation to the 21st century makes the story more relatable and Holmes's genius shines through brighter as a consequence.

The story borrows elements from the books but nothing has the same outcome as the books, leaving even the readers guessing. It is witty, funny and smart all at the same time.

And then there is the acting. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are perfect in their roles. They look exactly like how I imagined Sherlock and John to be while reading the books, albeit more old fashioned and John with the mustache. But it was their superb acting and chemistry that shine here. 

Only woe I have got is the 2 year wait in between every season. But as long as Moffat and Gatiss keep churning out wonderful stories, I can't complain.
