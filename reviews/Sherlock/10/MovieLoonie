I am not a big mystery fan, or even a big sherlock holmes fan. Generally, i don't watch mysteries at all. However, when i read the television write up saying this was a 'modern day version of Sherlock Holmes, who proclaims himself a high functioning sociopath', I couldn't resist. I absolutely loved it. The way they show how Holmes makes his deductions is ingenious and highly entertaining. The scripts are funny and full of suspense. The mysteries are great too. Even though it is not my cup of tea, I do completely enjoy them and am glued to the set when it is on, trying to get one step ahead of sherlock and figure out the puzzle. Of course, this never happens, but it is fun to try. The modern day touch, adding in all the new technologies to the stories is really great. The updated Watson, instead of an aging doctor, is a much younger Iraq war veteran doctor. Sherlock is a student at the university. It's just brilliant and well worth your time to watch. I would recommend this series that airs as a part of PBS Masterpiece Mystery to everyone.
