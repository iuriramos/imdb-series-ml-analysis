I had written a review on the mini episode also. I am righting one here as well. Of all 3 of the major Sherlock Homes renditions. Sherlock is the best one. The Sherlock Homes movie series come real close though. I rate Elementary (Johnny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes) 3 stars out of 5 from what I have seen which I believe is an OK show. The other two (Movie series, Sherlock) are in a hole other league though. I rate the Sherlock Homes movie series (Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes) 4 stars out of 5. I rate Sherlock 4.5 out of 5. So again Elementary is a good show from what I have seen. The movies are real close most of the time pretty much just as good as Sherlock, but Sherlock takes the gold. If you like Sherlock Holmes. This is the number one show to watch. Both the movies and Sherlock are both some of the best of all time. Obviously there are a lot of other great Sherlock Holmes since his creation, but those two are definitely too candidates for best Sherlock Holmes portrayals and versions ever. So if you really like Sherlock Holmes. The Sherlock Holmes movie series and Sherlock the TV series are must watch for you.
