Sherlock excels in on screen chemistry and superb acting. I had never heard of it, but watched it on a friends recommendation. Sherlock was so witty in the first episode and Watson, so stone cold with nerves of steel, that I did a binge watch of all three seasons. The villains in this series are very well acted. A few plot twists that I saw coming, but other than that, overall magnificent show. The only bad part of the show is that you have to wait about 2 years after every three episodes to watch the next series. This sucks if a season ends with a serious cliffhanger. 10 out of 10 from me. We need more shows like this on television with superb acting.
