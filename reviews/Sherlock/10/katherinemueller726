Another Sherlock Holmes show...My first thought was, "oh my goodness this is ridiculous another Sherlock Holmes, Really?????????????????????????" but I thought I'd give it a shot anyways and just watch an episode and see what a mistake they made bringing this show to TV and Surprise Surprise this has got to be one of the best Sherlock Holmes show ever! Story-lines have been great although the episodes are about :90 minutes almost like a weekly made for TV blockbuster movie. Cudos to the editing team on this. Sherlock Holmes with a modern touch and feel to it was a brilliant idea. The show has a very real feel to it and I'm really enjoying the episodes. Overall the show is fantastic.
