At first I was dubious when I heard of the modern retelling of Sherlock Holmes that was due to be released. In fact I was so dubious I did not deign to watch it at all. Alas one night boredom drove me to see what all the fuss was about. Boredom be praised for Sherlock has to be the best television series I have ever watched. The acting, script, and cinematography of the show is wonderful and everything about it is so utterly captivating that I cannot bare to tear my eyes away from it for a single second for fear of missing anything. Benedict Cumberbatch shines as Holmes in a way only an actor born to play the role can. Truly a splendid show that I cannot wait to see more of!
