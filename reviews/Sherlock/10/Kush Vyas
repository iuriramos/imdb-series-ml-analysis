I thought it would be another show , about someone solving crimes and stuff, but to my amazement i was Awed! literally speechless the way they portrayed him in modern day scenario I did not expect that, apart from the that each new episode will rattle your mind and make you think. Gripping Plots and excellent villain to watch :)Each character is delight so is the direction , even the minute details are taken care of ...

It is complete package and It is yet another work of British telly that is just too good , You would be awestruck :) It would be a loss if missed it :)
