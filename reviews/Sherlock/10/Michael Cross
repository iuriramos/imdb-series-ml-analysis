OK, so ever since I was a kid I have loved Sherlock Holme. I've read all of the books and watched a few of the movies that have come out. Some were good, some were terrible. The last Sherlock Holmes movie with Robert Downey Jr. was extremely good and I thought I was going to have to wait until the second movie came out before seeing another good Sherlock movie. So it came as a pleasant surprise when I stumbled on this BBC show. First off I love the 90 min episodes It's different and quite nice to have a long episode. Second, Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely and totally brilliant as Sherlock. I was a little worried at first when I started thinking he looked a little young compared to Downey Jr. but after watching the full first episode I realized that he is the perfect person to play Sherlock Holmes. Not to be outdone Martin Freeman works well with Cumberbatch and is a great match as Watson. The storyline too is very well thought out and interesting to try and figure out. This show is very fun to watch and well written. I am definitely going to follow this show until the end...Which hopefully won't be for a long, long time.
