On all fronts, this reinvigoration of the often seemingly done to death title is brilliant. The acting, writing, music, production, direction and cinematography leave nothing to be disappointed with. A crowning accolade is that this series coincides heavily with the massively budgeted Robert Downey Junior films, which as much as I have also enjoyed for their own qualities, are ultimately outstripped by arguably one of the BBC's finest efforts of the 21st Century. 

The first season hooked me effortlessly, and with the advent of the second and it's stunning opener, I can only wait with great anticipation for more!
