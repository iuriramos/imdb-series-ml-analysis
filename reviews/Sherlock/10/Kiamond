Wow. This is probably the best series I have ever seen. The shots are beautiful, the pacing flawless, the writing is witty (constantly funny, depending on your sense of humor), the casting is spot-on, the storyline is perfect. Probably the only con is the length.

Sherlock is not only a highly-entertaining show, but it actually teaches you something you can apply in a day-to-day basis: OBSERVE. Most of us see but do not observe. I must admit that after watching the show, I feel slightly smarter (haha) and more observant.

Wow. It's a must for everyone, especially those who value 'mind over matter'.
