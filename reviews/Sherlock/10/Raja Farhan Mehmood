My wife suggested this series to me because I am a fan of the writings of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle especially the crime scene investigation types really capture my imagination. Sherlock Holmes has done that and quite marvelously...Now the plots the story the characters the acting the directing all have played a vital role to the success of the series. In my mind its quite brilliant actually. No movie or series can be better than the novels but this series comes pretty close. In books we have to create characters and form a mental picture out of our imagination but here in the series its being done for us. Coming down to the actors now. Benedict I think is perfect for this role he fits like a glove. He has the perfect height,weight,physical appearance and all the moods and bad habits Sherlock has lol. Plus the genius role suits him very well. And I never thought imagined a modern Sherlock Holmes doing so well. I always thought he'd be more fitting in the old British times. The Director did a great job and the actors of-course. A must see. after an episode you will be hooked on for more. Enjoy Mates
