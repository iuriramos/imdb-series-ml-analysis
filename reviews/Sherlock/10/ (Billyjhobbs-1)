"Sherlock" takes many liberties with Conan Doyle's original works--and characters. But what a refreshing "re-visit" with the king of all detectives (and detective mysteries). Now in the 21st century, Holmes and Watson continue as a formidable pair, but tasteful to the times. The clever, very clever, fast-paced dialog (and repartee between the two) accentuate Holmes' genius. Fortunately, the creators of this new series (one hopes it will continue beyond these first three episodes) don't depend upon a lot of computerized, glamorized gadgetry, relying mainly on Holmes' brilliant deductive methods (in keeping with the original, of course). This series probably will not appeal to the Doyle "purists," but for the progressive thinkers, this will do. For one, the relationship between the two principles is more poignant. Dr. Watson (who has enough of his own baggage to carry) isn't the sycophant that the Jeremy Brett's Watson was--he's much more his own man, but the devotion is clearly there. Two, the series doesn't rely upon strong language, gratuitous sex scenes, or stomach turning violence to carry it along, although they're all there, just not stated. The chemistry between the two is perhaps one of the strengths of the episode as well. And lastly I found the suspense created in this series is much greater--sometimes much more subtle--than previous Sherlock Holmes films. In this version, the stories are original, but they still possess that Doylian touch! Let's hope for more: let the chase begin!
