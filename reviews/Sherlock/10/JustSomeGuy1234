I was reluctant to watch this show, as it just sounded like it would be campy and uninteresting. My thought was that Sherlock Holmes would be effectively useless nowadays what with all the technology the police have, so therefore I expected it to... not work.

However I was really, really wrong. This show is so immersive and captivating, and keeps you guessing continuously throughout each episode. The way that they have edited it makes it feel almost like a game, where evidence is displayed systematically before Sherlock works it out, it gives you time to piece the clues together and really just makes the show a hell of a lot more entertaining.

Also, the characters within the show are extremely likable - Sherlock being one of the most entertaining TV drama fronts I have ever seen. 

Definite 10/10 from me.
