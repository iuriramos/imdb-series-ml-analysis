I was skeptical at first, having read the Sherlock books. The change to a modern London is a bold move, since the 19th century setting always fit the stories so well. 

However, it is just amazing. From the beginning, you become intrigued, if it's not so much with the story, it is with the amazing acting of both Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. Benedict plays his role so immaculate, so ... weird, just like you want sherlock to be. 

The episodes are of course quite long, one and a half hour each ,which is basically a movie. However, you don't even notice. Before you know, it's over, and you just want to see more of this intelligent, intriguing show. I loved every minute of it, and would recommend it to everyone with a functioning brain.
