OMG what a series.Even better than Game of thrones and walking dead.and even better than old Jeremy Brett(1984).Old series was so great never thought after that any Sherlock series can comes.But it came and nailed everything.Every character is extraordinary.specially our Holmes and Watson.Story,Action,sequence is mind blowing.they set this series in our generation which sets remarkable.Screen writing is great.Its 1:30hrs long so i will call every episodes of it a movie.And i m big fan of Sherlock Holmes.Please make 1000 episodes of this series.best series so far.Must watch.Best series of this generation.sorry for bad English.
