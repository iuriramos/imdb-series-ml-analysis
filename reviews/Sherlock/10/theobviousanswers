This show combines so many great elements to be something truly wonderful. Like profiling? Mysteriousness? Forensic science? Criminal geniuses? Clever plots? Twists? Charming set design and lots of little details? Actors you can just stare at because they're so oddly fascinating? "Ah ha" moments? Twisted geniuses? Odd, adorable, profound, understated relationships? This is TV at its absolute best. Amazing, fast-paced story lines where I am so thankful they're film-length episodes, with wonderful characterisation.

Another great thing is that this show takes almost no time to get into, it's brilliant from the start.
