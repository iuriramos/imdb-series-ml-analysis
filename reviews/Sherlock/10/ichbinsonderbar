This television show far surpasses its peers in terms of quality, wit, and entertainment. It immediately grabbed my attention, and never failed to hold me on the edge of my seat. The acting is magnificent, offering yet another "modern" take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic characters. The updating into a present day setting is wonderfully handled and practically seamless, even producing an interesting contrast between Sherlock's old-world-style logic and the spinning technology of today. Watson and Holmes have a wonderful on-screen chemistry and play off each other fabulously (even addressing the "Are they gay?" question with ease and charm). The writing is fantastically clever, kudos to the team. Finally, I LOVE the way it is filmed. The camera angles, color choices, lighting, scene setting, costumes, on-screen graphics...it's all just delightful and captivating. I am not usually one to watch and follow a television series, but this is definitely one in which to invest your time.
