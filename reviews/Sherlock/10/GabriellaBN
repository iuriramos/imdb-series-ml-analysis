I would like to thank BBC for offering America what it lacks: quality TV. After confessing my love for Doctor Who and disdain that the season was over, I was suggested by a number of friends to watch this series. I owe them so much. From the minute it started to the ending credits, I was on the edge of my seat. Words cannot describe how brilliant Gatiff and Moffat are. The genius of their writing and directing is portrayed by the talented Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. I can't say I've watched anything like it, and the modern interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan's stories would make him proud. If you haven't already decided to start watching it, I suggest you start right now. Beautifully written, fantastically cast and a joy to watch, Sherlock is the best series I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy.
