A truly stunning modern adaptation of Conan Doyle's beloved detective classic.

Cumberbatch is mesmerising to watch as the socially inept yet unarguably brilliant lead character. He plays the role so well at times it's rather alarming. Witty, with a lightning-fast mind this portrayal of Sherlock Holmes is pacey and engaging. Truly wonderful script as well, with the characters' lines playing perfectly off each other.

Freeman is also wonderful as the slightly bumbling (only in comparison to Sherlock) Doctor John Watson. A very homely and palatable adaptation and one which I enjoyed a lot.

Overall I'd say it's the best TV show around, certainly the best thing the BBC have done in a long long time.
