First two seasons made me rate the series 10 which I do very rarely. But the third season made me so disappointed. 

I don't even remember why I rated 10. 

Very confusing speeches, lines and scenes just for some stupid blown up story...

I'm very very disappointed. All of this effort could be concentrated in much better way than ending up with 'did you miss me' of Moriarty.

Hope next season will be more watchable than this one. Otherwise this will be the most wasted series ever in my opinion.

Do you hear me Steven Moffat?
