(The Scowerers of San Francisco and the Molly McGuires: "Dark nights are unpleasant"/"Yes, for strangers to travel.")

This series is EXCELLENT. I usually hate any "update" or "re-interpretation" of the stories relating to The Master. (The recent Guy Richie disaster being a case in point.) But this is a remarkably clever series, very well done, and very well acted.

Among its other advantages: Watson is not played as a bungling idiot, but a reasonably intelligent, brave, and loyal friend who is confronted with . . . well . . . Sherlock Holmes.

I look forward to the next series. This is worth watching, even for avid fans of the Canon.

P.s. Would someone PLEASE tell IMDb.com to correct the oft-repeated mistake that Arthur Conan Doyle was the "author" of the Holmes "stories." All true Sherlockians know that Doyle was a quack "doctor" who stole all of his stories and ideas from John "Jack" Watson, M.D., Royal Army Medical Corps (ret.). It is revolting to see the "myth" about Doyle continually repeated.
