Today, we usually see excellent shows from Hollywood and all successful TV-Shows created there. Lost is a big hit during these couple of years. But last year BBC introduced us with a bright futured TV-Show : Sherlock. Now we can see today's crimes handled with Sherlock style.

Now, first of all is setting and other stuffs. Is setting get suited to TV-Show. My opinion is Yes. Because now we can really see what would be Sherlock and Doctor Watson like if they were in 2000's. The setting is excellent. It is like mirror to original Sherlock Holmes settings.

Secondly, it is acting performances. I think Benedict Cumberbatch had done an excellent job playing Sherlock. We always think Sherlock must be older person. But Cumberbatch shows us that a young, energetic and full of life Sherlock is way better.

Lastly, the scripts or the story lines. Of course I won't give any spoilers, the story lines are I think good. Because the writes must have hard job to optimize centuries old Sherlock stories to 2010's modern age Sherlock life. I think they have good job.

So, from story lines 10/10

from acting 10/10 ( Vaow Benedict Cumberbatch )

from script 9/10

My vote is 10/10.
