It was totally amazing. Very entertaining. Each episode was so exciting to watch. Although season 3 focused more on 'sentiments & emotions' between Sherlock, John & Mary. But it wasn't boring at all. It, in a way helped us to understand them more. Season 1 & 2 are quite convincing & heart winning with all the latest techniques to find the culprits and the way Sherlock used to observe things and people was brilliant. Also Sherlock's and John's chemistry was so good like true best buddies and they got good sense of humor. Overall it was really nice. 'A Must See I'd say'. It contains investigations, drama, humor, mystery,chemistry and of course lots & lots of fun. Hoping season 4 will be great!!! Waiting very eagerly for it...
