Friends, Dexter, Walking Dead, Game Of Thrones, 24, Criminal Minds, Homeland, Chuck (I like it a lot) etc. Great sitcoms. Good times. But none can match the sheer brilliance and wit of Sherlock. The Sleuth and his Doctor-Partner have been brought to life again, only this time, they are among us, flaunting phone's, laptops and GPS.

21st century Sherlock Holmes. Hard to imagine but Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat have pulled it off brilliantly. Sherlock is simply too good. To keep a person absorbed for 90 minutes is no easy feat, but to make them stay in the world of Sherlock long after that is nothing less than a wonder.

Cumberbatch and Freeman make mincemeat of their roles, music is top-notch, 90 minutes rushes past with indecent haste and we are left behind in our world.

To those who are reading reviews, without watching Sherlock or waiting to start, don't waste time, go see it now. Its a sin to miss such genius.

BBC, please encourage (even force) Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat to make a Season 3.

MUST WATCH!
