Outstanding series! Holmes and Watson have walked through time and now re imagined in a modern day setting, nothing has changed with these two dynamic characters. Thank you Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat for bringing the true spirit of Sherlock back! The cast is fantastic (Cumberbatch and Freeman,you nailed it!), the editing is spectacular, great cinematography, you are on edge throughout the series, non stop. I had a joyous smile along with goose bumps as I watched the characters we all love to read about so much execute each scene with uncanny precision. The show is a triumph! and will definitely go on record as one of the best Sherlock Holmes incarnations on television. It's amazing how the series retains a classical feel of the 19th century in present time. I'm certain Conan Doyle would approve.
