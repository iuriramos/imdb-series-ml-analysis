Hats off to the BBC Channel and Sherlock Holmes!! The stories are complex and contemporary with an excellent piece of television series and modern adaptation.Its funny, smart and witty.

You will never know what will happen in the episode. It contains so many twists, put your brain busy for every each second who can be a criminal and always ended with unexpected solution. Expect the unexpected!!! 

Its hard to ignore their well acting and drama.Each Season holds 3 three episodes which is enough to entertain you and it doesn't having an ending, it has a cliffhanger. Guessing, Guessing and why? ha In my conclusion, go for it and you wont be disappointed. I was reluctant to watch this show but my friend forced me to give a try. And i find Remarkable Twist and Masterpiece!! Genres : Crime, mystery, puzzle, drama, comedy and thriller
