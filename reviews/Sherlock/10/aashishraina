You will be glued once you start watching it... Each episode is simply amazing and you wont even realize that 1.5 hrs have passed! Every episode connects to the other. The story telling is just brilliant. I found it better than the movie. Being set in 21st century, you can connect to it more. Always love the arrogance of Sherlock! The last episode of second season is simply amazing and you wont be able to guess what is about to happen. Would have loved it if each season contained more episodes and have to wait a lot for the next season! I don't think direction and creativity can get better than this. So 10/10. :D
