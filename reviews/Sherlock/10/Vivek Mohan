I saw Sherlock Holmes (2009) and felt good. Robert Downey was good in the movie and gave a different meaning to the Holmes character, although many disliked it for various reasons. The atmosphere created by Guy Ritchie was nice.

And then i saw Sherlock, the TV series. For me no words can describe the series enough. If ever a Sherlock Holmes was needed it was this one. What a superb performance. What a superb direction. Cumberbatch, for me, is the best Holmes ever and at the same time every other role in the series is memorable in its own way. Also Martin Freeman makes John's character brings us close to Holmes and make us realize that Holmes is a human after all. I personally think that the role played by Jude Law wasn't good enough which left a void in my heart. In Sherlock, Watson is more comforting, caring & emotional which makes him likable and creates equal relationship with the audience as that of Holmes. There could've been lot of blunders since its very difficult to bring a 19th century story to the modern era, but a brilliant plot and extraordinary ideas made everything fall into place.

The way and manner the things are shown in the series, including how Sherlock thinks in different situations, is top notch. The only negative is that I was not able to digest the second edition of the movie because I began to compare it with the TV series. Just hoping that the next episodes are superb as well. My rating 10/10.
