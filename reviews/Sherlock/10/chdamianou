One of a very few series that can make you a fan of, just by watching the first minutes of a single episode. Very good acting, awesome plot and excellent technique of giving the thrill of discovery to the audience.

This modern version of Sherlock seems extraordinary and really eccentric but still seems like he could possible be true person. Similarily Dr. Watson is a pretty solid character without any inconsistencies. Very good characters that you actually cannot get tired watching.

I don't know if this could be considered too much but as a person who usually does like modernised versions of known characters in my opinion this might have even surpassed the original.

I'm also, one of those people who just registered to IMDb to vote for a round 10 this show and can't wait until the next episodes come out.
