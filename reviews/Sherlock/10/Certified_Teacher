I hate CSI and all those detective shows. That genre never appealed to me, but Sherlock is fantastic. The brilliant duo of Cumberbatch and Freeman as Sherlock and Watson (respectively) couldn't be better. These were the best casting decisions since I don't know when. Fearing that a modern day Sherlock Holmes would be cheesy, I haphazardly tuned in not expecting much. I was instantly locked in to the characters and story lines without complaining about plot holes and cheesy references to the original books. The series is composed of three 90 min episodes per season which will leave you hanging. I heard no promotion for this show nor saw any reviews. Netflix recommended it so I tried it. The best decision ever. Check it out.
