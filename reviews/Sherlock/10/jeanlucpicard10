Does anything more than that need to be said? Sherlock is an absolutely brilliant show. Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely stunning, abhoring us with his lack of care of others, while intriguing and appealing to us when he shows his vulnerable side. Martin Freeman is the perfect everyman who's found himself enjoying being caught up in these strange events. The chemistry between these two (not necessarily romantic, but it's possible) is amazing, and you can tell the actors are giving it their all. And the writing is the best writing ever conceived for a crime drama. While most tend to be formulaic and rely on gimmicks, Sherlock eschews all of that in favor of using the mysteries as a means of studying the characters, and the people behind these crimes. And while it may take place in the present day, it's clear that Doyle's original works have never been forgotten in the translation, something Elementary hasn't quite figured out. Whether its a direct influence on the plot, or just a simple mythology gag, Doyle's presence is always easy to feel. While it does have a few slip-ups here and there, it's just so good the rest of the time, you really can't tell. Or at least, you're not dwelling on it. This is an absolutely fantastic show, and I encourage anyone who likes anything to do with detective stories to give this a try.
