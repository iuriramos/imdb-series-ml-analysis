I am a life long fan of everything Sherlock Holmes well apart from that dreadful Guy Ritchie film. I like everyone else expected this modern adaptation to be terrible I didn't think bringing Sherlock Holmes to 2010 was a good idea, but I have never been so happy to be wrong, I was completely blown away by this; the BBC have done an excellent job as always. Sherlock Holmes was written in the Victorian era for the Victorian people so all they saw was the brilliant characters but all the new Sherlock stuff seems to written like the era is everything that is Sherlock Holmes but it's not it's never was meant to be about the time it's about the detective with his brilliant mind, his loyal and brave friend Dr John Watson, the completely bizarre nemesis Moriarty and the annoying brother Mycroft. And bringing it to the present removes the glorified era and concentrates on the characters the way Sir Arthur Conan Doyle meant it to be.

As for Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, I couldn't think of anyone better to portray my two favourite characters of all time. They way Benedict plays Sherlock is astonishing, he really is one amazing actor and his Holmes is the way I would expect him to be in the Modern era. Martin plays Watson as I have always imagined Watson to be; Loyal, brave and Sherlock's moral compass. I don't think anyone could make it better than what has been done here, I take may hat of to you BBC and the whole Sherlock team.
