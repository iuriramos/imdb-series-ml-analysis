I have read every Sherlock Holmes story multiple times, so I am very familiar with the characters and the original stories. I am blown away by the ingenuity of this series (hoped-to-be series). Who would have thought Sherlock could be plopped down in the 21st Century, not just totally intact, but attuned to cellphones, computers, GPS? How cleverly this beloved character has been remodelled whilst retaining his 19th Century charm. I cannot rave enough about this engaging, fast, intelligent dialogue, plot construction and beautiful filming. Amazing. The actors are already so embedded in my mind as the true characters, they cannot possibly be replaced! (Excellent, Excellent Casting!!) I've TiVo'd the three episodes and have to be content with watching them over and over.

Please, please, please, give us more!
