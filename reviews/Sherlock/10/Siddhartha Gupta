Aloof, ridiculous, often cocky yet human and very endearing (at least to me), Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes is a marvel of this decade of media, and it got someone who hates TV shows with a passion to watch not 1 but 3 seasons. 

He's not shown to be perfect, and that's where lie one of the show's charms. His analysis of other characters, while very entertaining, can sometimes miss the mark, as we discover in one of the episodes. He can be outwit too, if only seldom. But in imperfection lies genius (I made that up), and so does the quest to improve, on which we all continue.

Wonderful show!
