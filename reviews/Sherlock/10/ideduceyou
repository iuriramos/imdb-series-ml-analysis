Outstanding on every account. Script, acting, locations, directing, you name it. I specially love Martin Freeman's John because although Cumberbatch is my favorite Sherlock as well, this John has something I haven't seen in other Watson's, he is a person in his own right, he is neither outshadowed nor intimidated by Sherlock. Their friendship is of course the best thing about the show, it is very realistic and a wonderful thing to watch as it evolves. "Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend". Albert Camus I have watched each episode at least twice and I am not the only one by far. I think that speaks for itself about its quality. PS: Season 3 premieres January 19!!!!!!
