I have read all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and watched most actors, from Basil Rathbone to Jeremy Brett play the great detective. I thought that after the untimely death of Jeremy Brett, who could ever portray Sherlock Holmes again. Well it took a bit of imagination to come up with this modern day version of the sleuth. Without deviating too much from the canon, the writers have done an outstanding job. I have watched all of the episodes up to and including the first of season 2. The casting, chemistry and plots have been more than enough to retain the integrity of Conan Doyle's works while bringing then into the twenty first century of computers, smart-phones, weaponry, etc... At the same time,I think that there has been an improvement in the Dr Watson and Inspector Lestrade characters and even Mrs Hudson has more to say. Hopefully we will see more of Irene Adler ( played by Lara Pulver). In this series she is the perfect match for Holmes. This may not happen, given that she did not appear to often in the original works.
