I usually don't like it when a show makes significant changes to a story I already know, but this version of Sherlock Holmes is every bit as good as any of the Doyle novels. No spoiler alerts here. I just wanted to let new viewers know they are in for a treat. After watching the first two seasons I then watched "Star Trek: Into Darkness". Being an original Star Trek TV series fan I didn't think anyone could surpass Ricardo Montoban's portrayal of Khan, but Cumberbatch was great! I have watched many different Holmes movies and TV shows, but this is one of the few that my wife will sit down to watch with me. BTW...did anyone else notice that the theme song was taken from the old "Flint" movies (In like Flint & Our man Flint)?
