Nervous Holmesians can Calm Down. This BBC Series may have Updated the World's Only Consulting Detective to Modern Times, but They have done it with the Love and Respect that the Classic, Iconic Hero Deserves.

Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are Perfect Personifications of the Team and the Stories Often Reference the Source Material in Clever Turns. The First Conan Doyle Holmes Story, A Study in Scarlet becomes a A Study in Pink, for Example. The Other Tie-Ins can be more Subtle and are a Welcome Treat.

The First Season has Three 90 Minute Episodes and are so Well Done that the Thirst for More is a Done Deal. The Reason Sherlock Fits so Fine in this Modern World is because He was Always a Cutting Edge, Out of the Box, Inventive Character that was Ahead of His Time no matter what Time Frame He Inhabits.

So the Use of Laptops, The Internet, GPS, and the Like are Nothing New to Holmes. In Fact He Probably would have Perceived, if not Invented such Tools. In a Grin-Inducing Scene Holmes tells Watson..."I would be at a loss without My Blogger."...Sherlock in a Different Era has said..."I would be at a loss without My Boswell." "Elementary" has become "Obvious" and "The Game is afoot.", has become "The Game is on." Great Stuff this here New Sherlock.
