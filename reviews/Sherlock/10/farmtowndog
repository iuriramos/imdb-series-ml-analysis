What a joy to watch. Maybe a bit light for people who value the original Holmes but I thought it a good balance between the 'untouchable-uptight-aristocrat' he is in the novels and the "not so untouchable-'bubbly'-bastard" he is now.

Granted it's nothing like Sherlock Holmes..... but it's EXACTLY like it would have been if Arthur Conan Doyle was a child of this time. A completely successful transplantation to our time, our vises and our 'hang ups'. The stories are roughly along the lines of the original stories and sure paraphrase scenes. It's just that Watson is allowed to shoot obvious holes in Holmes's 'perfect' theories. (**Mild Spoiler**) The first episode has a scene where originally Sherlock deducts perfectly the state of Watson's brother by inspecting a pocket-watch. He now uses a cellphone and misses the fact that it's not his brother but his sister. It sure sets the tone for a fallible Holmes. (**end spoiler**)

If you like how people interact in the new "Dr, Who" and "Torchwood" you will not want to miss this.
