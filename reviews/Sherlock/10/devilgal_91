I grew up watching Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes and it is the one I remember the most. He was just awesome and the two actors who played Watson were brilliant but when I saw this version which takes 21st century technological and and cultural/society references and mix it together with the classic Sherlock Holmes stories, I was rather curious on how they would pull it off and I must say, it was absolutely ingenious. I was and still am completely hooked. The lines absolutely brilliant and hilarious, the acting is sensational, the writers, whatever they were drinking while writing this, please keep drinking it because it is by far one the best adaptation of any stories of any medium. I thought I never say this about Sherlock Holmes but Sherlock is sexy!! I cannot say enough about this show. Highly recommended!!
