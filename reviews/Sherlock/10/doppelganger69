One of the best TV series ever. The modern Sherlock has not disappointed the true Sherlock fans. Like many other fans of the real Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I was very skeptic about seeing Sherlock & his dear friend Dr. Watson using smart phones and all other modern gadgets. But, a genius direction and screenplay has cleared all my doubts. Terrific acting of Benedict Cumberbatch & Martin Freeman and the entire cast is simply too good. Waiting for the 3rd season to start.. I was a bit disappointed by "The Hounds of Baskerville", I thought it was less engrossing than the other episodes. The introduction of Irene Adler in "A Scandal in Belgravia" for me was the best episode so far.
