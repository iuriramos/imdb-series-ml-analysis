This is just great! I wasn't a big fan of Sherlock until I saw this, and that is thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch and his way of acting. You really fall in love with Sherlock, his expressions. It's also fun to see how he's changing by time. First he's a loner who doesn't seems to own a heart. He's a bit awkward and no one likes him. But after he meets Dr. Watson, you can see his development. He's getting more and more like a...human. Know he has something vulnerable, and that becomes his "weak point" and could be used against him.

And for John Watson, this meeting with Sherlock, makes him feel more alive than he have never done before. I mean, he gets quite often mad at Sherlock for his way, but he also enjoys it and just, lives with it.

If you ignore the fact that the whole story and the murders are awesome, their friendship makes it worth watching! 

I'm also following Game of Thrones, which is a great series, but Sherlock's actually coming higher on my rating-list. I want that it will continue and that they should make maybe..well, for being reasonable, no less than 5 seasons more. Because it's just excellent!

10/10 absolutely!
