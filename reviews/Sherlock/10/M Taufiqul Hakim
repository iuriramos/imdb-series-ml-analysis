I've seen a lot of detective movies. This movie is like an educational for me. This series completely fill my mood, with a good and cool actor like Benedict Cumberbatch. Seriously, this actor makes me feel like "I wanna watch every movie/serial involving him". As this series, Benedict acts full of desire that he wants to be Sherlock Holmes. I've seen almost every Sherlock Holmes novels. This man is deserved for all of every personal as in most in the novels.

My favourite episode is The Reichenbach Fall. As you know, the scenes are not the same picture as in novel, but it's clearly excellent idea Steven Moffat and others that they show in Reichenbach with that modern way. I'm honestly very curious with the next series, with Moriarty of course in the villain.

I recommend this serial and rated for the best serial detective of all time!! 10/10.
