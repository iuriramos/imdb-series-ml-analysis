Sherlock. This show deserved to be credited under the legendary detective's name because this show is phenomenal. Each episode is like a movie you could see in the cinema: the cinematography is fantastic, the writing is great (even if it does seem at times contrived for the sake of the story), and Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman bring two of the best leading roles ever to be seen on television, period. The two work together so well on the screen that it's hard to believe they got two of the greatest actors currently working on a BBC television show by the writers of The League of Gentlemen and the current run of Doctor Who (Mark Gatiss & Steven Moffat respectively).

If you haven't seen Sherlock yet and you're a lifelong of Arthur Conan Doyle's classic detective... WATCH IT ASAP!
