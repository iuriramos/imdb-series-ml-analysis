This is, by far, one of the best shows on television. It's fast-paced, witty, and full of suspense. Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch are fantastically cast and the story lines are thrilling and unusual. The creators of Sherlock successfully combine the classic elements of Sherlock Holmes with the modern world. It's unique and incredibly well written. Visually, this show is gritty and dark. It fits well with the mood of the show and successfully transports these modern characters back into a world of mystery. I'm not usually a fan of British television but Sherlock is fresh and charming. It's a must see for everyone.
