I must admit I was apprehensive about this show at first. I am an avid Sherlock Holmes fan, have read all of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories over and over again. But after the first few minutes I was hooked. The only downside is that there are only three episodes out so far. I can't wait for more!!!! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are excellent in this show. It works! They pull it off perfectly without losing the essential qualities of the characters. To all of you out there who love a great mystery you will love this show. Fast paced, believable and funny. I haven't enjoyed a show this much in a long time. Good work to all involved, it's wonderful!!! The Game Is On!!!
