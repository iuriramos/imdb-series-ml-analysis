As a Sherlock Holmes fan, I approach any adaptation with trepidation. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly entertained.

Steven Moffat and pals once again show that they have a suitable finger on the pulse of modern, accessible drama. Although (and because) many attempts have been made, the Sherlock Holmes work is a notoriously difficult piece and genre to translate for a modern audience while remaining true to the elements that make it so popular. I think the team made some bold creative choices and pulled off the additional challenge of establishing world, characters, and back story while getting into the action as soon as possible.

Cumberbatch does a masterful turn as the complex Sherlock, playing the fast-paced script with believable eccentricity and mastery. Freeman's character was the ideal counterpart to this, if a little unresponsive at first. The interplay between these two and Lestrade (Graves) was nicely and humorously set-up without falling into a extremely well-trodden three-character path in this genre.

The script was sharp and efficient, moving fast but with pauses to catch your breath, and the story had good twists and turns to keep you guessing. Those who are used to an obesity-inducing diet of gritty crime thrillers may see this series as tame but I think that the team delivered a first episode that achieved a great deal and, most importantly, was hugely entertaining. Can't wait until the next episode...
