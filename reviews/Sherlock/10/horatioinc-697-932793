My daughter introduced me to this series. I was naturally skeptical that a modern adaptation could possibly capture the feel of the original stories. I was very pleasantly surprised. The feel and tone of the shows are very true to what I feel Conan Doyle would have written in a present day version. It is very impressive that the writers can incorporate so many modern devices, such as cell phones and blogging, into these classic stories without making them seem out of place. The casting is perfect. I hope that this show has a very long run and that - as a stretch wish - all of the Sherlock Holmes stories can be presented in this series. What a DVD collection that would be!
