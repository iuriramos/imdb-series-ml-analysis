It is definitely the best TV series I have ever seen. Everything is perfect: directing, acting, camera, script, combination of history and modern technology... My biggest praise, however, goes to director Moffat and actor Cumberbatch and since this series I have tried to find and watch their other works - and been satisfied as well, especially with Hawking. Both those names should be remembered and monitored in the future.

The only "minus" not taken into account in my vote - that so few series have been made. I do sincerely hope more are coming - respective hints were revealed a week ago. I can hardly wait!
