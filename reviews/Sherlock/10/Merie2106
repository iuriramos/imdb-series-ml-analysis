When i first heard about sherlock i wasn't sure, if i should watch the series. There was always "Sherlock Holmes" starring Robert Downey Jr. in my mind, which i like very much. So i wasn't sure, if a British series could come close to the movies. I'm so glad i changed my mind!! I don't know any series where i love each single character. First of all Benedict Cumberbatch: I think they couldn't find a better person playing Sherlock Holmes. He's the best choice in any way. Then of course Martin Freeman. He was the reason why i decided to watch the series. The chemistry between Freeman and Cumberbatch is amazing and it's great seeing them on screen together. The hole cast of Sherlock is amazing and i'm glad to know more great actors now: Mark Gatiss, Andrew Scott, Una Stubbs (she's so lovely), Rupert Graves, Louise Brealey... I've rarely seen a series that's so exciting, funny and great written as Sherlock. It's definitely my favorite series of all time!!
