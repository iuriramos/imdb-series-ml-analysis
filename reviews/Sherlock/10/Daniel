Everything a Sherlock fan would want. Mystery, cons, fun... and Cumberbatch. The sheer fact that I needed subtitles to comprehend a couple of lines when Sherlock just talks too fast (usually doing that when explaining things to Watson) is enough for me to fall in love with these series. Awesome plot and actors.

The cases are not boring and yet they are not overcomplicated. Very nicely done in terms of finding clues (whoever came up with the on screen text which points out the clues deserves to be kissed) and also the way Sherlock observes and analyzes the scene is remarkable.

Highly recommended.
