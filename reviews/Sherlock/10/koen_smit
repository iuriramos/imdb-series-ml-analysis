Extremely witty writing, extraordinary acting and a very well made modern take on classic Sherlock Holmes stories. Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch are at their best and so is every other actor, in big and small parts. Andrew Scott as Moriarty deserves to be mentioned as well. What an evil nemesis he portraits, his acting choices are extremely intelligent and enjoyable. Every episode is a beauty production-wise, smart and a great pleasure to watch. It makes me laugh out loud many times and makes me jump on my couch from excitement what will happen next. I think there are not many series that will ever come close to this brilliant BBC's Sherlock. Yes, I am truly a huge fan.
