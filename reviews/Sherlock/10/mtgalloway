What's most brilliant about this version of Sherlock Holmes is it's ability to recognize what makes the character so interesting. We, as an audience, envision characters in their native setting--where the author placed them. In Doyle's case he was using his own time period as the setting and therefore most incarnations take their cue from this. But this, in the case of Holmes, has nothing to do with what makes him interesting, clearly. This version proves that the character is interesting no matter what setting you find him in. While others work so hard to recreate late 19th century England--i.e. The Guy Ritchie Versions--this BBC version creates more compelling characters and interpretations of the story--truer, I would say, to the spirit of the original stories.
