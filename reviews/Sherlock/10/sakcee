After reading the original sherlock Holmes many times. I tried to read many authors who tried to revive the art of Conan Doyle.

None were good. Till now

Writing is excellent, smart, funny, intelligent. puts the Hollywood to shame.

The acting of Benedict and martin freeman is flawless. 

The direction is superb. I am hooked on every episode. But the 'A scandal in Bulgaria' is one the best viewings on films ever on small or big screen!

Highly recommended!!!!!
