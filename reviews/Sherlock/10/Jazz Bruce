For years my parents had been telling me I needed to watch this show. I put it off for the longest time simply because it was my parents that recommended it to me. When I was flipping through Netflix the other day, it caught my eye and I decided I'd finally give it a chance. Best decision ever. This is, hands down, THE BEST SHOW I've ever watched. I hate to agree with my parents, but SERIOUSLY. It's so good. Not only is it an incredible spin off of one of the most popular book series ever written, but the time and detail put into it is mind blowing. Sherlock is portrayed as a brilliant, yet somewhat socially indifferent character and Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect person to play him. In my opinion, no other detective/mystery/crime fighting/drama show compares to this one. The only complaint I can possibly think of is that it's incredibly hard to wait 2 years for a few more episodes. Completely worth it though!
