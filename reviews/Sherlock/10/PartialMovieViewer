Way too clever. As many displaced Yanks who lived in the U.K., I enjoyed many programs never exposed to the U.S. viewing public. When I finally returned to the States, I would often hungrily wait months for these shows to resurface on the American Silver Screen; when  sadly - my hopeful anticipation would be squashed by disappointment. Never giving up, I would go to the ends of the earth in order to view my favorites like, 'Heartbeat' or 'Father Ted'. If I were still in Cornwall, this program would easily fall into that category of favorites. I am so happy I stumbled upon this show, thanks to Netflix®. What a ride - the menagerie of intertwining plots are swiftly weaved together by some gumshoe spider hooked on amphetamine. I devoured the staccato line delivery like caramel corn and consumed the brilliant plots like my favorite fountain drink. To put it plainly  the show is brilliant!
