Instantly addicting. I want more! It is only marginally gratifying that the BBC will be producing more episodes to come out in the autumn of 2011. It isn't soon enough. Considering all the trashy sitcoms produced, this is a magnificent series. What could be better than a rebirth of Conan Doyle's,cerebral Sherlock Holmes in modern times. Benedict Cumberbatch is a vibrant choice for the mercurial aloof detective. I like Martin Freeman as a more intelligent Watson after all why would Holmes be accompanied by a doofus. The explanation and reasoning behind Holmes and Watson's deductions reflects excellent writing and it the puts the game afoot once more. Puzzles, action, mystery, crime, and the incomparable Holmes! I eagerly await my next fix.
