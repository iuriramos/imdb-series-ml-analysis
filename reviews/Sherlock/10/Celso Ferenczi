For me, the best TV series of all time! Conan Doyle's original stories, scripts, actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman and Andrew Scott etc. perfect! Benedict Cumberbatch brings a sideshow, with its excellent memorization, diction and performance. The 1st and 2nd seasons were great! Too bad they are few episodes (only three) per year. I wish there were many episodes per year! The Ep. 3 of Season 2 (The Reichenbach Fall) is the most dramatic charge of TV and film in the last decade! The Season 3 started very well and promises quality, intelligence and suspense, marks the series! Congratulations to the series creators Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat! Congratulations to the BBC for the excellent quality of this TV show!
