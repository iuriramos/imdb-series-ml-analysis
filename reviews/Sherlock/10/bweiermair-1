... as Sherlock Holmes would say when faced with a new case. Brilliant writing, masterful execution. Not possible to improve on this work of art. 

Benedict Cumberbatch is impressive as the fast-talking smart-mouthed Holmes with dialog delivered with laser precision. Martin Freeman is the perfect balance to Cumberbatch's Holmes, injecting empathy and understanding into their otherwise analytical world. The supporting cast manages to keep up with Cumberbatch and Freeman - impressive performances all around. Each new character only adds flavor... can't wait to see more of Andrew Scott's quirky Moriarty, who strikes the perfect balance to make you believe his love/hate relationship with Holmes.

Downside to this treasure is there are too few episodes to watch. Upside is the dialog is so quick and witty that you must watch each episode several times to catch everything. 

BRAVO to the filmmakers. Hats off to you.
