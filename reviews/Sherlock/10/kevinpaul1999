For those who love mystery and Sherlock will and must love this TV series of Sherlock Holmes . Benedict cumberbatch is the most suited actor for taking the role of Sherlock and so is Martin freeman the best choice for being Dr.Watson. When I first saw It on BBC I thought it would be boring and would have gone for the Robert Downey Jr. Movie. But the second I saw the first episode I could not wait to see the rest of it and I promise you the minute I finished watching the first or second episode I spent hours and hours of time on deducting. This is one of the best TV shows I have ever seen and I tell all of you out there reading this to go and watch it as soon as possible. Can't wait for the rest of the series to come out. The writing is excellent on the story of every episode and well illustrated on the basis of the books by author Conan Doyle
