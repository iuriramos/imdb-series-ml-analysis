I'm in love with this series!! Ever since I've watched the pilot, I'm hooked. Period. I've been a fan of Sherlock Holmes for quite a long time and I've actually read the books, so I know for sure that this series gives the most accurate portraits of each character in the original book. At first, I thought the character of Dr. Watson was a little off. However, as the story went on, I found both characters compliment each other, making them the greatest partner relationship on TV ever! I've seen two seasons and I can't wait for the third season. And I'm proud to say that I've dragged a British expatriate living in my hometown into my new obsession of watching this series. He said that this is the greatest British series ever! I can't agree more!
