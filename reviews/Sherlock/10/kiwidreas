truly an excellent show with incredible casting, and even better acting in the famous roles of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. In my eyes, and sometimes not so humble opinion, a true must-watch for anyone, and quite possibly the best portrayal of the world-famous detective.

the chemistry between the actors and the the baffling story lines will continue to keep you on the edges of your seats during, and even after, almost all of the episodes. 

now, in 2015, i can honestly say that this show has an excellent chance of being the best show this decade. I wholeheartedly recommend this show to anyone. 10/10
