Having read majority of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works and seen several movies and TV series based on Sherlock Holmes, I can say that BBC's latest version of SH is an artfully crafted piece and one of the best mini-series of our time. From the script-writers to the cast, from the director to the seemingly insignificant stunt in any given episode, everyone seems to put an incredible amount of effort, and the result never disappoints the audience. Sherlock mingles genius-level detective stories with humor and great acting, and adds all sorts of emotions usually with a jaw-dropper plot that gives you almost anything you could expect from SH. Also, Cumberbatch and Freeman have an amazing on-screen chemistry and it adds to the pleasure of watching such high-quality work. It can't be easy to adapt SH to today's world, yet the conversion has been brilliant and head-spinning; so, hats off to all those involved in this masterpiece. To date, we have seen 3 seasons, and each episode has met the expectations or delivered more than what was expected. In other words: there are good TV series, and many great ones, and some brilliant series, too. And then... there's.... Sherlock!!! I sincerely wish the best of luck to anyone who'll ever try to make something more awesome and as epic as BBC's Sherlock. They'll most certainly need it. Absolutely gutted that now we have to wait another century or two for the next season, but at least I know it'll be worth the agony of waiting.
