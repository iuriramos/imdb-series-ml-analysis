It is the best show ever made in the history of television. I am so envious of everyone who hasn't watched it yet, because it is an unique experience. If you are reading this review, don't waste your time; make a big cup of tee, lay down some cookies and turn it on! It will surprise you, it will excite you, make you laugh so many times, but also cry because the acting is just superb. The friendship between Sherlock and John is so tender and natural, that I totally forget that these two people are acting. It shows how truly astonishing work was done by the creators of the show by picking the actors for the roles. And of course Moriarty!!! Oh, you will love him, hate him, want him and want to kill him, not necessarily in that order. He is as brilliant as Sherlock and they are the perfect nemesis! This show is witty, clever, funny, dramatic, sad, scary at times, sexy when you least expect it, and brilliant every second of it's time! And last but not least, I love it with whole my heart.
