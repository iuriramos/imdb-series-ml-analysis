It is appropriate that in the U.S., most viewers have seen Sherlock on PBS Masterpiece. That is what Moffat (in directing and writing etc) and Gatis (in writing, directing and his incredible acting) have crafted. Stories that are familiar and yet fresh and brand new. I would list my favorite cast members but the ensemble make this a most excellent modernization of a timeless classic. I honestly have never had interest or have watched the Americanized modernization in the show "Elementary", simply because there is no way it can capture the essence of the great detective and his associate, in these modern times. Yes, it's aggravating that each season is only 3 episodes long but, when you consider that each episode is practically a feature film in production quality, waiting, acting etc. I gladly wait the painful time until that next season comes to PBS or BBC America. Watch it, you won't be disappointed.
