Season 3 was different than 1 and 2 but is that really a bad thing? Episode 2 of season 3 had me laughing and laughing, too! This is Sherlock at different level. Don't be fooled by the people hating this season!!! Every episode of Sherlock throughout the series is good (yes, even the Baskerville episode). One thing that really struck me was that each episode of season 3 was different in tone, too. It's possible that the characters were just a bit too winking at themselves but that really just goes to show the popularity of the show. This show is consistently witty, intelligent, funny, unexpected. My only gripe with the show is that as an American I have to listen very closely when Sherlock talks rapidly, as his speech seems to get quieter and more accented at those moments.
