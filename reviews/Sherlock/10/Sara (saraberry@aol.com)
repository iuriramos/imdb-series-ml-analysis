Only bad part, need more episodes sooner! If you have any intelligence, you should watch this~ Acting - tremendous, plots - tremendous, twists - amazing...sex- there yet sublime...even the lighting is great... it is like a whole package finally has been done correctly. I am so sick of watching garbage TV. Or coming in the middle of something fairly good that I then need to watch 20 episodes to understand the character motivation. You can dive into any episode here, though you may want to watch the Pilot first. The last episode of season two has left me screaming for more! I have been terribly concerned that the actors are so good that they are going to be grabbed up for other roles before they can come back to this, not to mention the writers. Please please please more! Heck, get a movie out! Throw away that horrible Sherlock stuff we have to watch in the US. THIS is what we need to see. Intelligent TV.
