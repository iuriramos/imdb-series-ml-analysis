The Science of Deduction has come. 

Sherlock has me spotted as on of the best TV series i have watched over the years. Followed by many others. When i was first introduced to SHERLOCK by my colleagues, i was skeptical because i confused the TV series with the movie with Robert Downy Jr. which i did not fancy very much. In fact i was bored while watching the movie. Benedict and Martin have really showed me the enthusiasm of this TV show. I am highly impressed as each episode is a movie with a great plot twist. Although only 9 episodes have been released to season 3, Sherlock always comes out with Over 90 Minutes of good quality footage and VFX's. 

Sherlock has successfully trapped me, a must watch TV series as i recommend. In my other reviews, i always talk about the Soundtrack because i love to admire the music just as well as the movie. I'm not particularly interested in TV soundtracks, but once again Sherlock has a wonderful soundtrack to listen to in your spare time, just like i do. 

I'm sure everyone and i will be awaiting the return of season 4. Great work to the whole BBC and Sherlock team, keep up the awesome work.
