The list of movies/series I've watched is not too long. But this is one that I really like. I'm not really good at explaining WHY I like things, I just do.

Like many other series this one is very addictive and gives me the urge to just bench-watch everything, but watching it too much kind of ruins the show for me cause it then turns out to be a little bit too much of the same over and over again.

I'm not much of a movie/series-critic. This is just my very own opinion and I would not recommend anyone to use my reviews as a tip to watch things!
