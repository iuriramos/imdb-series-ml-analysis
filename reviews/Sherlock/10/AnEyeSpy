The humorous, dangerous, very British 2010 Showcase version updated with internet and mobile phones revived my interest in Doyle's classic Victorian murder mysteries promoting early forensics and deductive solutions. Surprisingly, old and new Watson (Freeman) are both injured veterans of Kandahar, Afghanistan. The city of London is still an old character. Cumberbatch has a lighter, less melodramatic interpretation than Jeremy Brett and not caught in explosions like Downey. Study in Pink is loosely based on Study in Scarlet, (Spoiler? having a choice of pills, placebo or poison, and a hack-cab driver hiding in plain sight). I hope NA takes up the series, I was so disappointed not to see more.
