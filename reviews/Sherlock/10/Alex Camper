Very good TV series! Very funny and lots of hidden jokes. Great story and great actors. I loved every single episode. The actors play the parts perfectly! The filming and editing is also very well done and is very fun to watch! A great modern version of Sherlock Holmes. The long length of each episode never gets boring and the show looks fantastic in High Definition! The soundtrack fits the series perfect and the songs are very very catchy. Definitely worth watching and anyone can enjoy it! My type Sherlock as it is all modern adaptation and that is what I love so much about this version of the Sherlock Holmes story! Fantastically made! 10/10
