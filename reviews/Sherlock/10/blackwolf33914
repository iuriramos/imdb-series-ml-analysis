I was never truly a fan of the great Sherlock Holmes, never read the books or enjoyed the films of him but when my literature teacher, who was obsessed with Sherlock Holmes from BBC America, forced the class to watch the first episode I was hooked. More like in love than hooked, we only saw 20 minutes of it, that was the first day I wanted to stay after class. Witty, funny, exciting, with fantastic acting from Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman this is a show that is truly worth the time. Sherlock here is better then ever, not to offend any of the Robert Downey Jr. fans but to me that Sherlock Holmes film is him acting just like he did in the Iron Man movies, just Tony Stark extra smart. One of the best shows on television that you'll never tire of, they need to make more episodes per season personally. Each episode keeps you hooked in more ways then one, the fact that it isn't like most crime shows in which the villain is always different, here there is a consistent villain that is every bit as intriguing as Sherlock. The strong bro-mace between Sherlock and Watson adds the extra cyan pepper here, the small little gay jokes is whipped topping.
