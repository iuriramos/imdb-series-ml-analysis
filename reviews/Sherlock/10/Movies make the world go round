when I was in seventh grade, my best friend recommended it to me. She did her best to persuade me, but I never gave it a chance until now (ninth grade) when I was bored and gave it a shot. BEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE. I made myself only watch one a day because there are only 9 episodes. I found that throughout the day I could. not. stop. thinking. about. Sherlock. I have never in all my fifteen years of life experienced a TV show that got hold of me THAT FAST. I do not understand how my friend managed to live without asking me every single day to watch it. I have telling every person I have come across to watch this show, even if I don't know them. THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST SHOW EVER
