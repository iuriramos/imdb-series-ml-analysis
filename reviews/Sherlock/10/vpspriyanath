I was surprised when i start to watch first couple of minutes of Sherlock.I thought " they will kill Holmes again after the latest film" But i was wrong, the show was extraordinarily marvelous. i think writers have done a great job on this. it's a extraordinarily adaptation and also a modification. Holmes character is marvelous. he is not acting.. that is just Holmes. second important part is wotsen's character. it has created somewhat funnier. but it is not doing any harm to the story line or to the original works of sir Arthur Conan doil. for me the hero is the writer of the show. each of every episode take us to another dimension. this may be the greatest modification and adaptation for any TV show. hope to see more...
