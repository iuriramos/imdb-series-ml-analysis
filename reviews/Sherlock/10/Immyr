I always was a fierce reader of Conan Doyle works and the modern transposition of it is just perfect. Brilliantly written, remarkably directed and magisterially acted. Sir Arthur would have been happy.

The use of modern technology is just enough.

There is the magnifying glass.

I really really miss the pipe (I began smoking pipe partly because of Holmes);)

Well all is not perfect. A bit of dirty Harry in this Sherlock character. A bit too fiery too (but the actor is much younger than the traditional Holmes, well maybe a young Holmes then) and a brilliant conversation ended with a gun is not a good conclusion for anything.

Except some of these little points, the rest was very very enjoyable.
