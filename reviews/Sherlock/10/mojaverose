After the great Jeremy Brett I thought my days of seeing Holmes incarnated perfectly were over. I was wrong.

This production is no less perfect, yet entirely different, and I am amazed at the talent involved. Many thanks to all.

I especially like the new way that they are showing Holmes' investigatory talents to the audience, instead of our having to rely on conversations between him and Dr. Watson. It frees Watson to be more of a partner than just the stand-in for the audience.

I also like the fact that this Holmes is neither omniscient nor omnipotent. He needs his friends. That makes him both more human and more likable. The humor is exquisite; totally unexpected of Holmes, and, again, perfectly done.

After all, we may worship Icons, but we don't really Like them. The idea of bringing Holmes down to earth a bit works wonderfully well for modern audiences.

Thanks again, and We Need A Series!

Addendum: We have now seen all three of the episodes that were made, although I am advised that we have not yet seen the Pilot. Also, I expect that British audiences had seen all the episodes before we did in the States.

OK; If we don't get a series after that last ending, I am going to write a Very Harshly Worded letter to the Head of the BBC. It just isn't Done, Old Boy; not Cricket; not the Done Thing, to leave the poor audience like that.

Or as we in the States say, Get The Lead out of your Assets and Giterdone!
