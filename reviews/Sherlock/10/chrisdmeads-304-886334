For those of you who thought that a modern adaptation of Sherlock Holmes wouldn't work, think again. The BBC have truly struck gold with Sherlock and with the greatest actor to ever take on the iconic role, Benedict Cumberbatch. Sherlock is a very intelligently written show that keeps the viewer in total awe of upcoming events, to stunning effect, whilst managing to emotionally engage the viewer also. Many of the classic Holmes stories have fitted seamlessly into the modern urban environment and Steven Moffat must be credited for this truly stunning piece of work. Martin Freeman is fantastic as the noble sidekick John Watson and he and Urna Stubbs's Mrs Hudson provide many moments of comic relief, which are much welcomed when the plot becomes overbearing. Andrew Scott deserves praise for his unique portrayal of the insane and very camp Jim Moriarty. However it's Cumberbatch who really raises the standards of the show with his stunningly accurate portrayal of the emotionless, enigmatic and utterly intelligent super sleuth that is Sherlock Holmes. Ultimately Moffat has created the greatest crime drama on TV, with its witty humour ,plot based narrative, unpredictable events and utterly brilliant main protagonist. Who said that the British couldn't make good TV?
