I love cliffhangers. Not only does each episode of Sherlock end on one, but the end of each series leaves you guessing too, meaning you have no choice but to watch the next series! And thank God I've kept watching it! A gripping, complex crime and mystery drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, who are both incredible and portray convincing roles. What I like in a programme/film is a mixture of emotions, and Sherlock certainly makes me laugh and cry. I won't lie and say EVERY thing in Sherlock is realistic, but that's part of the entertainment! If you haven't seen Sherlock, I suggest you catch up now before Series 4 begins, which I'm very much looking forward to!
