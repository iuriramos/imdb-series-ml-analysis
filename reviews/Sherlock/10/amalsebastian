PERFECT.I mean there are so many different movies and shows about the same character and yet this feels so different. After watching the first episode the exact words that came out of my mouth was;"unbelievably incredible."However, i found the 2nd episode in the second season a little dull. It felt more like they had to include the hounds of Baskerville. My favorite scene; of course, first meeting b/w Sherlock and Irene Adler.And how the second season ended,the way they shot him jump off the building.Yes. This should be one of the best shows i have ever watched. I hope the writers don't get carried away with the next season.
