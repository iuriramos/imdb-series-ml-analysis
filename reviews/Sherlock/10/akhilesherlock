Surprised to see a 9.2 for this epic! How can someone miss to give this piece of sheer excellence a perfect 10?

Mark Gatiss and Steve Moffat have done such a commendable job that even Sir Conan Doyle must be clapping in his grave!

I had thought, no one on earth would play Sherlock better than Robert Downey Jr. and I was so wrong. Hats off Benedict!

In sherlock's words, I am very "ordinary" to find faults in this series. Well, I am damn sure there aren't any.

A scandal in Belgravia and The Riechenbach Fall being my personal favorites, I can watch this series any number of times. Just hoping that Moriarty isn't dead...:D Waiting eagerly for the third edition.
