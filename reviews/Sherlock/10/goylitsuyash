Wonderful. The best of Sherlock that I've ever seen. It contain everything right from the Game of Shadows to Elementary. Just how it should have been. AWESOME!!!!! Perfectly designed to attract viewers and mind blowing screenplay, the way we expect in Sherlock. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are exceptionally well as usual. Overall, the episode was perfect, just the way I expected. The best one so far in the trilogy and expecting further more from the coming season. Wonderful. The best of Sherlock that I've ever seen.
