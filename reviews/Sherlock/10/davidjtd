Sherlock, An outstanding piece of work by the whole cast and crew of the BBC. So many twist, very unpredictable and very well put together. Benedict and Martin are the perfect match on screen. There on screen relationship feels so real and they compliment each other very well. The show is suitable for a wide range people with its seriousness, unpredictability, plot twists and subtle humor. This show is a spectacular piece of work very deserving of a high rating. It's a show you can watch numerous times over and over again without becoming bored as you see things from different angles every time as you get into the mind of Sherlock. A really brilliant spectacle.
