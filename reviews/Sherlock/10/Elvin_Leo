Hard to take on classics, yes even more so like the immortal works of Arthur Conan Doyle. What only screenings of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson we hadn't seen. We have before us a modern London and the two main characters-Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.The first works, he said, advising the detective, has uncommon abilities, but detective has no friends because of their heavy nature.Watson is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, now works as a doctor, rents an apartment, along with Holmes, at the same time as his colleague in discovering cases.No Holmes, Conan Doyle if he did not exist, and there are now.His image is entirely different, he does not smoke like hell plays the violin, harsh in his behavior and decision-making.As for Watson, his image is more or less fit in with the standard ideas about their prototype.Charismatic Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Holmes, cope with its role at all one hundred percent.Its purely English person remembered perfectly, he has excellent mimicry, it really goes under the contemporary detective role, like it or not. Sherlock is a film series where each episode is a cocktail of clever murder and improbable conclusions and investigations of the great Sherlock Holmes.
