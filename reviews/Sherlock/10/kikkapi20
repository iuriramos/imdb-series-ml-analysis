We love the show. Great actors and characters, great story lines and a beautiful setting. The show contains everything you want in a series including drama, comedy, romance, and a little quirkiness thrown in. Anyone can find a connection with the characters because there's a little of them in each of us--and in the cities we live. From the first season through the most recent, the characters go through many changes in his professional, personal and romantic life. And we love being on that roller coaster with him. 

The show is timeless and its fans are devoted to the show and its characters. Long live SherlocK!
