"i was hooked the entire way. man and when it ended i pulled my hair and said wow for minutes on end, m lips trembled, my heart raced. the best BEST THING EVER! WOW! damn the best~!!!!"-thats what i said as soon as i saw the ending of the first episode of season 2 "Scandal In Belgravia". First off, this show is an immensely entertaining, genius, genuinely funny and absolutely one of the(or perhaps even the best in the modern world; certainly the best in its genre. The actors are phenomenal due to their own subtle portrayals and the dialogue and the screenplay is top-notch as well. The pilot is definitely very interesting and the unaired pilot although is slightly different, it is nonetheless very interesting. However, what made me register an account at this hour just to rate this show was after watching 'A Scandal In Belgravia'; if not anything, just watch the show up till this point and i freaking swear on my grave that you will not be disappointed. Im still shaking because of the ride this took me on. A true masterpiece which i will never forget. 'Sherlock Holmes'...this is a gift to humanity seriously!
