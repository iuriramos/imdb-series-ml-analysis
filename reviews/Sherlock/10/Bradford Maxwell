While I do enjoy the American production Elementary, I am infinitely more captivated by the BBC series. I might be biased having been a fan of Doyle's character prior to watching the series but even before I was aware of it's existence I wondered what it would be like if Holmes and Watson were investigating modern day crimes so I gave it a Google and found the first 2 seasons on Netflix. I was hooked. The heroes of the story are absolutely on point and Andrew Scott as Moriarty paints the perfect picture of what an iconic villain should be. Now as we're approaching the Christmas special airing Jan 1 I can hardly contain myself. Unfortunately, I know very few people in my circles that have seen the show. I assume it's because I live in the South and more people are attracted to shows like Duck Dynasty and Swamp People. If you haven't seen it, stop depriving yourself. It's worth checking out. Even if you don't enjoy it, it's only 3 seasons with 3 episodes each. Granted the episodes run 90 minutes each but many people waste more time than that everyday looking up adorable cat videos on YouTube.
