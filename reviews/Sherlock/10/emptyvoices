I'm relieved I never saw an episode of Elementary because that would only seem like a cheap imitation in comparison. Benedict Cumberbatch is a visionary in his style of acting which should be drawing sharp attention to his skill. I'm a film major and it saddens me that many of my classmates still don't know who he is. I think this will inevitably change. True, some got to know him by performing in a predictable Star Trek film. But this series is actually where people should really grow acquainted by his talent. It's a wonderful and compelling series. My only complaint is that there are only 3 episodes a season but then I must speculate that is due to the exceptional thought and follow through on behalf of the writers, directors and editors for where can we have a story, a classic set of stories adapted to modern day London without them. At any rate, this series far excels the movies and what America or begrudgingly I say, we, since I'm American, attempt to do in cheap imitation.
