i have never seen such or had imagined such a remarkable execution, such beautiful translation, and such i don't have words for it. all the actors, the supporting actors, the writer the director, trust me, this is a blessing on TV. this mini series is the epic conclusion of what modern day television should be.

the actors blend in their respective roles so much better than you can imagine, the story is written in such a way that someone who does not know who sherlock is, will or may be interested in knowing more and eventually will buy a book of sherlock holmes novels. 

bbc, has re defined television, i was impressed by their other shows, like top gear, but this one, like i said, i really cont find the words for it. best episodes, s02e01,s01e01, s02e03

thanks
