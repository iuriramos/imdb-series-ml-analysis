I generally have little to nothing to do with television that doesn't involve live sports, but had this program recommended to me by several people whose opinions I trust.

I was not disappointed. This is clearly the best show that has been aired on television since, well, maybe ever. The portrayal of Holmes is an Aspergerish highly functioning sociopath is magnificent, and the three main characters, Holmes, Watson, and Lestrad are brilliantly acted such that we see the characters we read and loved, but are shown new interpretations that all fit perfectly. The new take on Moriarty took some getting accustomed to but in the final analysis it works well with the modern bent of the show.

DO NOT miss this. I watched the first episode at 9:30 p.m., and stayed up until about 3 a.m. before falling asleep on the couch, woke up the next morning and watched the remainder. Magnificent.
