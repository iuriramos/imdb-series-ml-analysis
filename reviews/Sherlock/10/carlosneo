I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan since I was a kid, it should have been the firsts books that I ever read in my life, and, like others viewers I was concerned that this modern version would be a totally disaster or just no so graceful like the books. My opinion after seen so far? Totally amazing. The series holds your attention and breath from beginning to end. The best retelling of the London detective ever made. The work of Benedict Cumberbatch alongside Martin Freeman is to impress even the most Septics. The adaptation of the stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to present days really impress. The feeling that the viewer has is that Sherlock would really do exactly the same as the show nowadays, exactly as Benedict does in the show. The representation of introspective features of Holmes character as well as his strange habits and methods of deduction are well represented. Truly the best remake of Sherlock ever made.
