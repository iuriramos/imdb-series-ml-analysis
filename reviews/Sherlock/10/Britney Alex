I really love the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle books, and i really enjoy this series! It's so improved to the 21st century! Most of young teenagers would probably pass the opportunity to watch this great series but i'm not included! This has to be one of the best shows i've ever seen (Sherlock and i really love Doctor Who)! I recommend it to all ages and i recommend young people, like me, to read the books and just enjoy the great series that are inspired in really big and awesome books by great authors! This show is based on the Sherlock Holmes books and it's so cool for all ages! They use their own gadgets (iphones and stuff like that)and the show itself has it's own magic that makes you completely fall in love with it! It happened to me! I'm so excited for the 3rd series premiere! January 1st will be my lucky day! Followed by January 5th (the second episode will be aired on that date)!
