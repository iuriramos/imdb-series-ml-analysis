I have never written a review, nor even commented about a TV show, but just had to about this one. I normally hate almost all British TV shows as most of them are boring, dry, and look like cheap Canadian films with a $1000 budget.(which I hate most of them as well) But this show is a must watch for fans of detective/whodunnit shows, or smart shows in general. I honestly can't understand why this show only has a IMDb rating of 9.2. (which is probably already the highest rated TV show on IMDb) If any show deserves a 10, this is it! The only bad thing about this series is there has been only 7 episodes so far. Can't wait for more to come out in 2014.
