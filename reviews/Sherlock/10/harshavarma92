Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be very pleased to see the new millennium Sherlock Holmes.This TV version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work of "Sherlock Holmes", incorporates plots from the classical stories, in an unexpectedly good modern interpretation.I have just registered on IMDb after watching the first episode of Sherlock as I was compelled to get it out there that this show presents extraordinary brilliance in its delivery of my favorite fictional detective.

The plot is a terrific, fast-paced, edge-of-the-seat adventure.All the elements of Holmes are present and intact.The cast is spot on.Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes is an excellent choice-he is physically right (tall,lean and capable of throwing some pretty nasty punches) and he is a damn good actor.Martin Freeman was also great as Dr Watson.All he actors are already so embedded in my mind as the true characters, they cannot possibly be replaced!

This is a treat for every fan of detective novels.It is a must watch and hopefully the series continues.The game is definitely on!!!
