I have already left a review, but just couldn't contain myself from writing another one... 

This TV show has everything - amazing acting, great story-line, beautiful directing... What I like the most is that there is actually no need for cliff-hangers as a way to compel people into coming back. Each and every episode is pure perfection and it's exactly that what has you hooked. 

This is British television at its finest! 

Oh, and one more thing... Music! I can't tell you how happy I am that a present day high production TV show doesn't use cheesy pop/rock/whatever songs as background. Sherlock has these beautiful melodies that almost feel cinematic like a cherry on top. 

Absolutely gorgeous show that that should be on everyone's 'must see' or even 'favorite' list regardless of their usual preferences. 

Cheers!
