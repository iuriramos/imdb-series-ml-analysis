Not too long ago, when I was subconsciously searching for something entertaining, my good friend out of Ontario has recommended to watch this questionable series, it was hard for me to break in to it at first, as I was quite fond of my own particular image of Sherlock. Yet this magnificent series simply grew on me episode after episode, to a point of me expressing a feeling of more than familiarity towards it.

I would simply say that this is a remarkable cinematographic achievement with an array of talented actors and the best series you can watch to date.
