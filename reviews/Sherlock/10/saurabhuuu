a great delight, gone is a shell after watching this, every thread is well connected to make a complete package ,Sherlock as I was compelled to get it out there that this show presents some PURE BRILLIANCE in its delivery of my favorite fictional detective. Benedict Cumberbatch has done a great job to make this character alive, portrait of a genius detective. Sir Arthur would, I believe, approve of this adaptation and be pleased that yet another generation is able to live the thrill of the chase.

One word to describe this show."excellent". A true master piece.

just saying " I AM SHER LOCKED". 

eagerly waiting for "2013" ...........season-3 see u soon.
