I love the Holmes stories of Doyle since i was little girl. As i heard in 2012 there is a series about my favorite detective nothing stopped me from watching it. (All 2Season in 2days ;) It's such a great one,everything fits perfectly. The actors are chosen wisely

Cumberbatch is a great choice for Sherlock Holmes- he is a damn good actor. Martin Freeman, about whom I never heard before is an excellent foil for Holmes without being the dumb sidekick that Dr Watson has often been. And Andrew Scott as Jim Moriarty is just great, he is as frightening and great at the same time. It's so different from Robert Downey's interesting take on Conan Doyle's characterization. (like the first movie too.) - The story line moves along at a good pace and held the attention brilliantly. Especially the last episodes of each season is like a small death every time (Cliffhanger/Hiatus) For me the Series became like an addiction. It cant wait for the 4th season to finally come out.

For everyone who read some of the stories, do yourself a favor and watch it.
