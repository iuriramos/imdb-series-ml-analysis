So exciting and satisfying to see Sherlock modernized (never done before in all of its myriad incarnations that I remember) and absolutely spot on casting and writing. Modernization in directing, humor, mystery puzzle and production made this an unexpected joy. The gimmick of the overlaid text for the texting and his clue spotting was a joy indeed. And just when you think this will be just some sort of humorous take on the series, they throw you a very sinister curve ball with the appearance of an old nemesis...and we're not even 30 minutes into the script yet! Outstanding. This is just another example of the raw depth of talent and expertise available in British media. It makes me wonder how much excellence I'm missing of the series that don't make it over here on DVD or Masterpiece Theater, even though I try to gobble up all they send. Please oh mighty gods of media, keep these guys on the air for years to come!
