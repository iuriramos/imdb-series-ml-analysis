The writers, true to their word, did not "re-do" Sherlock Holmes, rather, they rebooted it, to make Holmes appeal to this generation as the original would appeal to London in 1880. None of the modern aspects feel contrived, and I love how famous aspects of London were integrated so well into the series. It all contributes to a unique atmosphere that is quite unmatched by most adaptations.

The dialogue is fast paced, witty, funny and real.

The acting is, of course, superb. Benedict plays the role of Sherlock Holmes impeccably, and his long monologues of deduction are pitch-perfect. He adds a twist of sexiness (just because he's a very good looking actor). He plays the genius, the sociopath, the inner softie...Benedict brings so many new layers to the much-played character. NOTE: some of his speaking is very fast, so if possible, use subtitles.

Martin Freeman is a perfect Watson. He's smart, funny, and unflinchingly loyal. His performance in the Riechenbach Falls especially, was completely heartbreaking. In his performance, you just can't help but love John wholeheartedly. The relationship between John and Sherlock is completely perfect. It has just enough innuendos to keep fans happy, but remains completely real and sweet.

Perhaps the highlight of the acting comes in the form of Andrew Scott as the deranged Jim Moriarty. He plays the insane villain so well, mixing the insanity with humor, childishness and sophistication. On the whole, it makes for a believable, frightening, iconic villain.

The true highlight of watching Sherlock, however, is in the camera work. The filming tells a story by itself: from the deductions, to the fast-paced sequences, watching Sherlock is not only watching brilliant actors bring a brilliant plot to life. When you watch Sherlock, you truly are watching a piece of art.
