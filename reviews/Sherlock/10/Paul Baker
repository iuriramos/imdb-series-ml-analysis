This is the best show I've seen in a very long time. Started watching since it was on Netflix and was a little curious. I did not care much for the old movies, but the modern age version had me interested. I've now watched every episode at least three times and can't wait for the new season. I'm on IMDb regularly for news related to the show.

The show is well written and produced taking you through the case and thinking process or Sherlock Holmes. By the end of the show, there is no doubt how he solved the case. The show is witty, funny, and thought provoking. All of which is sorely lacking in TV today. In fact, after watching "Sherlock", I notice that I don't watch as much TV anymore due to the lack of entertainment in other shows.

I promote this show to everyone I talk to, especially those that think "Elementary" is a good show. (SPOILER ALERT! It's not good at all!) 

Very anxious for the new season and hope for many more after that!
