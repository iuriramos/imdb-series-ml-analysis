The BBC's modern-day adaption of Arthur Conan Doyle's original Sherlock Holmes stories is an absolute breath of fresh air - not to mention one of relief. Equipping Holmes with a smart-phone and laptop could so easily have led to a tedious, unimaginative result, slapping itself on its back with easy jibes at our modern times. Instead, it's become a sleek, exciting and, above all, extremely clever piece of television. You get sucked into the mind of the genius, beautifully visualized through bits of text and numbers appearing around everything that he sees. In general the cinematography is pitch-perfect with lots of eye- candy but none of the over-wrought kitschy effects you might encounter in other, less carefully produced shows. But all this fades into insignificance next to the simply brilliant writing. It is no small thing to stand on the shoulders of Conan Doyle and hold your balance, but I do believe Moffat and Gatiss have pulled it off, at times even rising above the old master. 

I don't know if the recent movie adaptations are any good, but I don't think I'm going to try them. After watching this adaptation, there is just no need. When films and television came about, an empty spot was created for the perfect Homes adaptation. This is one is it, and there can be no other. Go watch it.
