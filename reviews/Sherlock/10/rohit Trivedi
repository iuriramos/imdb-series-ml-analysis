I really don't know where to start, It's all coming out at the moment from my heart as I just finished watching the end of 2nd season. I watched Robert Downie's " Sherlock Holmes" movie which I found it good but I always had a question that " why people always had a cult following for Sherlock Holmes??" As I never read the books or the stories about Sherlock Holmes but now after watching this series I now realize what and why Sherlock Holmes is so important for his fan following and why is he such a cult imaginary figure. 

Apart from the series there are too many things that an individual could learn, intellect as well as improve your perception about the things around. To be frank I myself have tried to view things and people around (funny though), and just like he said " All you have to do is, just, Observe"
