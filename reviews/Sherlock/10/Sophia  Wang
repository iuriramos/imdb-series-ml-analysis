I just created my IMDb account and my first rating that i did was 'Sherlock', for 10/10. This show is simply amazing and is such a compelling adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. The characters may not be spot on but everything else about it, i love. To me this show is amazing it is so thought out and i can tell there was so much effort put into this. You can't help but to fall in love with the characters. This show is what i wait for, for two years for the next season to come out but i love it with all my heart. It made me laugh, frustrated and cry. It is and forever will be one of my favorite TV shows of all time.
