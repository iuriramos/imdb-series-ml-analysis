I have always been a fan of mystery shows, and Sherlock, in my opinion, beats most of the rest. Not only does it have intriguing plots based on Sir Conan Doyle's books, but is funny, fast-paced and just overall entertaining. The quality of the acting and writing is simply unbeatable, especially for a TV series. Despite the use of cell phones and the internet, the series is actually surprisingly faithful to the original books, and each episode is filled with funny little salutes to Doyle if you search closely enough. Each well-crafted episode is like a mini-movie, with complicated, twisty-turny plots that frankly, twisted my brain. I am pretty certain Conan Doyle would be pretty happy with it. I certainly am!
