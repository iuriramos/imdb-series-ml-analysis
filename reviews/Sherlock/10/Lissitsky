First watch the unaired pilot and you'll see how good it could have been, better in fact than the Robert Downey blockbuster.

The revised first episode is inferior though and its the best of the rest. Bringing in Moriarty shows they are looking to ape American series: Buffy/Charmed/ad nauseum and avoid writing original scripts. This is one area where faithfulness to the original stories was needed.

Benedict Cumberbatch' 60s wardrobe is inspired and his contemptuous disregard for contemporary servility will hopefully inspire a fashion itself. 'British Corporate Broadcasting' would particularly benefit. One suspects the deadening hand of executives lies behind the faults in this brilliant concept.
