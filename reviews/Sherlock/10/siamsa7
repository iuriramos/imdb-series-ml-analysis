"Sherlock" is an arresting ride from the very first minute, driven by complex characters and well-developed cases, a modern spin on a classic tale that works on every level.

Cumberbatch plays Sherlock with the perfect balance, flirting with the fine line between genius and madness, a self-proclaimed "high functioning sociopath" with attributes that are equal parts infuriating and endearing. Despite his own protests, there is heart under the intellect and soul beneath the brilliance. The best and truest moments in his performance are those in which these two opposing forces collide.

There to snatch Sherlock back from the edge is Martin Freeman as John Watson, the perfect character foil in his steadiness and heart-driven practicality. John is a scarred man in more ways than one, but like his new flatmate, he's not content with the status quo - and there is something about chasing a case around London that secretly delights and intrigues him.

There's a reason that these two characters have stood the test of time. They are dynamic and fascinating and their bond is the stuff of legend. It's not romance (it's not that kind of spin), but it is - or it becomes - appreciation, respect, brotherhood and yes, love.

This incarnation is unique in many ways, not the least of which is the present-day setting. Here, Holmes, Watson and Moriarty become Sherlock, John and Jim. Pre-industrial London becomes the endless modern maze of concrete and glass. Guns are drawn and shots are fired, but the real battle - as always - is mind to mind, wit to wit. Humour peeks in at the most absurd of moments, laughter breaks out when least expected, and quiet personal reflections provide the perfect contrast to the coldness of murder.

All in all, "Sherlock" is TV at its finest. If you haven't had a chance to enjoy this unique drama yet, the only question that remains is: what are you waiting for? Watch at once if convenient. If inconvenient, watch anyway. :)
