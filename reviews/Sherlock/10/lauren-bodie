Sherlock has to be, HAS TO BE the GREATEST SHOW of ALL of HISTORY! The eloquence of every word said, the fluidity of the acting, the captivating nature of how the stories are told, AND the overwhelming ease of sex appeal. Absolutely blows my mind! they keep me wanting more.... I couldn't fault the actors. For those that want to fault Benedict 'Cumberbatch's portrayal as being too mean and callus, one must not forget that Sherlock is a man with an addiction of almost every vice and is most human for this reason. Without coming off as insane, as an audience member appreciate the calm he maintains. Casting for this programme was perfect; minor roles included. I hope that for the future of Sherlock, the innovation is continued............undeniably without error has this modern day Sherlock sprung life to what I thought was a dying medium!
