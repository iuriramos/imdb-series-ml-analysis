This is a review of Seasons 1 to 3 of this series of BBC TV films. It was a very bold and risky idea to try to update the Sherlock Holmes stories to the current day and treat the material entirely in a contemporary manner. It could so easily have gone wrong. But it has been a sensational success because of the inspired and strong performances by Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson. The rest of the casting has been equally breathtaking and risky. Lestrade the policeman is played by Rupert Graves, Mycroft Holmes is given a great deal of air time and is played eerily by Mark Gatiss, the co-creator of the series, and most outrageously of all, the villain Moriarty is played by Jonathan Aris. Any of these wild casting ideas could have gone so disastrously wrong as to wreck the entire project. But instead they all work in the most fantastically creative and innovative fashion. The series really is a triumph in all respects. Only Episode One was weak and unconvincing, because Cumberbatch had not yet got the measure of his character, spoke too fast in his rapid speech scenes so that it was impossible to understand much of what he said, and wobbled a great deal, so that at first I thought the series was not working. But, having struggled in Episode One, the native genius of Cumberbatch emerged fully formed from the brow of Episode Two, and from then on he was scintillating. So, hats off to everyone. The ten films so far have been directed by seven different directors. They say Series Four will not be broadcast until 2016, probably because Cumberbatch has now become so famous that everybody wants him for everything, and I wonder if he ever has a day off. Let's hope at least that he keeps writing his reviews for IMDb and that he will solve his next Sherlock Holmes cases as soon as possible. No one can wait.
