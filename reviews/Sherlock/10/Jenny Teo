I am a Sherlock Holmes fan and have watched different interpretations of the stories on this great detective. I had always thought there is no way any version could ever top the Granada series by Jeremy Brett...that is, until this iteration came along.

The show is a glimpse of what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would imagine his detective to be if set in the modern times. Even for non-fans, the intriguing and riveting episodes will keep them on the edge of their seats for most part of it. 

The entire net of cast, story, direction, music, production etc was tightly woven to create what would definitely be a lauded as the top-class act of the century. You can feel the passion and enthusiasm radiating through the screen, as the Sherlock team puts together what would be the best TV show for a long time, appealing to both aficionados and laymen alike.

The easy chemistry, admiration and loyalty between Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and John Watson (Martin Freeman) for each other is heartfelt, their interactions equally charming, forming what would be the bromance of the century. Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss teased endlessly with witty exchanges, tickled Sherlock Holmes fans with many little references to the original stories, and capably re-created the brilliance of Sherlock Holmes stories for the modern world.

Great things do not come often, and when they do, they don't come more than 3 episodes per series. That, to me, is the one and only "downside" of Sherlock. If this series can't appeal to you, nothing else can.
