Right! This series of shows are my most favourite by far of any other television programme. I watched it once and just couldn't help but buy the box set! I love this show so much... slightly obsessed. Even though Sherlock is arrogant and rude, Sherlockians (people who love Sherlock) find it adorable and and sweet. John Watson is the opposite of Sherlcok, but at the same time, the exact same. Oxymoron, I know, but that is kinda how they work. John is the comforting person who cares about the client, yet Sherlock only cares about the facts so he can solve the case quickly. I do extremely recommend you watch this and see what I am blabbing on about! 

**WARNING**

If you do watch it, do not blame me if you get obsessed. No-one gave me the warning before!
