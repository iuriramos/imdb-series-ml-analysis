BBC's Sherlock has created the perfect environment for me from a childhood hero in order to be the most perfect display of who he really was. I would say its the best acting, or the best music, or the best editing, but, no. I wouldn't say that, I would say it is the overall best show in history, better then anything I have ever seen before, someone set out to do this the right way, and they succeeded to the fullest of standards. I hope for future seasons that rip my heart, carry my soul, and put an impression on one of the greatest men that never lived. They didn't miss a single thing in describing his true performance and character, not only that, but just watching the show made you think about Sherlock, not because that the show was actually based after him, but because they thought like Sherlock when they wrote every bit of information in this show. The way the camera pans, the way they walk, the way they move, all look how it should inside Sherlock head. I don't know why a tony hasn't been awarded yet, but they deserve every tony in my mind.
