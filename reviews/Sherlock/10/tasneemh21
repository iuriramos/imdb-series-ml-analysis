This series has it all... drama, mystery, wry humor and a very clever way of presenting the process of each investigation that Sherlock undertakes. Even the most bland episode "The Blind Banker" is so much better than the mundane endless American crime dramas. What sets this apart is the brilliant acting of Benedict Cumberbatch. He totally owns the show with his strong screen presence and the pure charisma that he seems to exude in each and every scene that he is in. Sherlock starts off as this eccentric closed off sleuth but over time undergoes gradual transition as a character though his encounters with characters like Moriaraty, Irene Adler and Magnusson. Benedict manages to capture that perfectly. A fun enjoyable series... 10 out of 10
