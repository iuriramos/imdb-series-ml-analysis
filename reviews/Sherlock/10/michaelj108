A wonderful adaption and up-date of Sherlock Holmes. Brisk, coherent, and contemporary. It seems effortless. He is Sherlock Homes and this is Dr Watson. The references to the stories are like coded messages to those of us who have read them, but they do not obscure the fun for those new to the franchise. I watched them one-after-another, I was so hooked, while traveling. I ordered the DVDs while still on the road and when I got home I watched them again with the family. A hit with all concerned. I am now giving the DVDs as Christmas presents this year. The first one, 'A Study in Pink' was made twice, first as a pilot and then again for broadcast. That is a luxury but the results show. 'A Study in Pink' is brilliant. London is a character that determines some events. The streets, the rooftops channel action. The addition of Mycroft in the broadcast version is priceless.

I have read the stories, some more than once, and seen all of the Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett films more than once. I have also seen just about every other Holmes film in English. Once 'A Study in Pink' started I did not think about any of them.

I rather liked the restaurant scene in the pilot more than in the broadcast version of 'A Study in Pink.' Compare the two on DVD and make up your own mind.

I marveled at the use of IT and the effort to project Holmes's thinking. Never seen anything like it before. It also offers by implication an explanation of why the perfectly normal John Watson puts up with the condescending, irritating, self-centered twit that is Sherlock Holmes.

I also found the introduction of Moriarty's name powerful.

I am left wondering about Holmes and Watson will get out of the cliff-hangers they were left in at the end of 'The Great Game.' I definitely want a lot more of 'Sherlock!'
