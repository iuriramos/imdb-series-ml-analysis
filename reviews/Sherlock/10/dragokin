Contemporary crime drama has currently been dominated by Scandinavian authors, with most notable examples being The Killing (Forbrydelsen) and The Bridge (Bron/Broen). In a figure of speech, Sherlock won a race for the best show with the other two, but they were both breathing down his neck. There were two main reason for this success.

The first and obvious reason is the legacy of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Homes. The main challenge has been to bring it close to contemporary viewers. The lever to overcome it has been modern technology, both in terms of TV production as well as tools which Sherlock uses and abuses in solving his cases.

The second reason is Sherlock himself. Even the best detectives find clues where you might expect them, but only Sherlock is a step ahead of the game. What else would you expect from self-proclaimed highly functional sociopath?

Although the format of one case per episode loses when compared with contemporary shows that stretch the plot across the whole season, Sherlock sticks with with the old formula. There are plot lines that follows us through seasons. On the other hand, the intensity with which the story is told, as well as the amount of data Sherlock processes, 90 is the right running time for such a show.

And If you've seen Elementary with Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu, it is obvious that the authors borrowed heavily from Sherlock.
