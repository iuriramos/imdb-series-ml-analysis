I am a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's engrossing novellas. I highly like the modernized version of Doyle's characters, using his detective plots. The work is full of wit and makes the audience surprised and above all it does impress. Starring Benedict Cumberbatchhe as Sherlock Holmes is entirely successful and he reflects the characteristics of Sherlock Holmes as a literary figure. In spite of being a modernized version of Doyle's novellas, it gives the same fascinating feeling while watching it on my laptop as if I am turning down the pages of Doyle's engrossing novellas. I as an English Literature student find it highly successful and entertaining as a literary adaptation,thus it deserves a 10 out of 10. I heartily recommend it.
