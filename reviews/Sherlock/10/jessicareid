This is an extremely unique version of Sherlock Holmes and it is absolutely brilliant. The way they have taken this classic character and adapted him to the 21st century works so well and makes him much more interesting.

This series would be nothing without the two actors who brought their characters to life, them being Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. Their on screen chemistry is fantastic and they portray Sherlock and Watson in a new and entertaining way.

Each episode in these series are around and hour and a half long which is great as it gives time for a really good story to develop and unfold in each one. Throughout the series there is some thrilling action, some dramatic suspension and also some subtle British humour here and there. It is also really interesting to see Sherlock and Watson meet at the very beginning and watch how their friendship develops.

I am extremely looking forward to the next series, I can't wait to see how it will start out after the dramatic end to series 2.
