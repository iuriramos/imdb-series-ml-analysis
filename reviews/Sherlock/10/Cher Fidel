An absolute masterpiece, one of the best works I have ever seen. Benedict Cumberbatch is a brilliant actor, his authentic talent I have noticed in the extraordinary movie "Amazing Grace" from 2006, where he memorably played the character of William Pitt, the youngest British Prime minister from 1783. Martin Freeman is also done an excellent job, and this is the best tandem Sherlock-Watson which has so far been made. Their characters are so subtly blended with each other that I can not imagine any other actors in their place, not just in terms of psychological interpretations, but even in the physical appearance which is also part of the extraordinary fine- tuning applied in casting.
