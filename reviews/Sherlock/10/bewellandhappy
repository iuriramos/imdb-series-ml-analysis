In my opinion, there was nothing this good on British television since 'Blackadder' and 'A bit of Fry and Laurie'. 'Sherlock' demonstrates that the spirit of the UK is not completely destroyed by global capitalism. 'Sherlock' is above all about humanity, individuality and taste - the things that 'Wolf' pronounced dead in the distant early 1990s. 'Sherlock' raises spirits and gives hope. And the fact that it is beautifully written, directed, acted, photographed, edited and designed is a nice bonus. Something to watch over and over again. Beautiful work by Mark Gatiss, Steven Moffat, Benedict Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman and the whole team!
