This TV show is seriously amazing. For those who really like intelligently woven criminal TV shows, this is for you. Benedict is the next Dr House with the same grin and the same narcissism and also an immense deductive skill. Properly amazing. Freeman and Cumberbatch are really great together. This show is incomparable to the Movies done by Downey Jr because it's a totally different setting given that Downey Jr sits in the past. This show has been magnificently modified to hold into it the new technologies and all the latest features of the London city. I strongly recommend anyone who likes Criminal TV shows and also who likes the characteristics of Dr House.

Truly amazing.
