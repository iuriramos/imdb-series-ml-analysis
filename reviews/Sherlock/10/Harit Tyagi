A show that even the most die-hard Sherlock Holmes' fan would appreciate! It's the most exciting show on television.A must see! A television classic! An explosive thriller that keeps you guessing every step of the way! I give "Sherlock" all the stars in the sky!"

Intelligent writing is rare these days and this show is a beautiful showcase for smart writers. Love the dialog s and the actors'portrayals. It is one of those shows that keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. It always leaves you craving more! If you want your mind sent into warp speed, your curiosity fulfilled and your language skills sharpened to a razor point fall into this Sherlock! 

Acting superb, villains the meanest creeps, people who aren't what they seem aplenty! Writers I thank you all for an incredible ride.I am completely SHER Locked!

Every show had me on the edge of my seat. Funny, sad, engaging and intriguing. I highly recommend Sherlock as a show not to miss!

Love it!
