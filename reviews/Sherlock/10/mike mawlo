This show can easily be summed up by the adjective 'brilliant'. It has been far too long since I've watched a show where the writing and acting both work perfectly in tandem. I don't believe a better job could have been done in terms of casting, and the two leading men own their characters in every sense of the word. 

If you're in the mood to watch a fractious genius dissect the most daunting of cases, look no further. Watson, acting has Sherlock's reliable sidekick, adds a much needed sensibility to the often outlandish disposition of Holmes. However, when it comes to rationalization, Sherlock puts on a clinic that is surely unrivaled but any plausible character. Despite the profound conclusions that Sherlock comes to from details that are seemingly insignificant, and completely undetectable to the average person, there is still a feeling that it's possible for a man so clever to exist. Which, in many ways, is what makes watching the show so enjoyable; in that the character of Holmes is believable and someone that many would like to identify with.

With so many mainstream mystery/crime shows dribbling out of the big networks using the same generic formula, it's very refreshing to find a show that has a unique feeling about it.
