Truly brilliant 21st century adaptation, and the more familiar you are with Conan Doyle, the more enjoyable it is. The best part may be the writers' recognizing that Watson was an unreliable narrator - he was always far more competent than his own modest self-portrayal, and this version has a great partnership of super-sleuth and skilled man of action.

Just one example of many enjoyable translations: folding the conflicting accounts of Watson's war injury - was it a Jezail bullet to the leg or the shoulder? different accounts in different stories - into a real injury combined with a psychosomatic reaction. If you're a Holmes fan, this kind of detail is great fun.

Recommend this series very highly.
