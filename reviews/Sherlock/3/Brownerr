Over acting galore in this tripe. This is like the school play but worse. Read the lines off a script and ham it up as much as poss. Arthur CD must be turning in his grave. Some decent actors here you'd expect , but it panders to modern mediocrity. I was comatose after 20 mins but this series seems to go on for ever and it doesn't get any better. The only one who can act is apparently Una Stubbs who must have be wondering how the others ever got into acting, because quite frankly its embarrassing. The normally excellent Martin Freeman struggles to mix it with the over the top behaviour of whatever is going on around him. If this is the future of TV then heaven help us
