Sherlock is a really great series. Along with Doctor Who and the Walking Dead, Sherlock is one of my favorite shows. It has an well balanced mix of drama, humor, and mind-blowing plot twists packed into movie-like episodes. I expect nothing less of Steven Moffat, the mastermind behind some of my favorite Doctor Who episodes. Although I was disappointed by The Abominable Bride, this show is still awesome, and it is one of the best shows on TV. I am looking forward to the next series: Steven Moffat and Rachel Talalay have proved themselves an awesome pairing with Heaven Sent from series 9 of Doctor Who, and I am excited to see what they bring to the table with Sherlock.
