It was 2010 and a good friend says you gotto watch this. I ignore it cause, I did not want to spoil my image of the pipe dwelling and tweed suited master and replace it with an internet savvy and cell phone wielding imitation. It was 2011 when the ratings were out and another bunch of my well known critic-friends tell me I just have to watch it. I listen to my heart and ignore it once again. Its 2012 and when stuck on a job, I turned to "Sherlok" Season one Episode one just to humor myself...and there began a love story which I hope never ends. Its brilliant, surprisingly stays authentic and true to the original and you feel the pages of Mr.Doyle's writing open up in-front of you. Mr.Doyle himself would have been proud. Its a fantastic adaptation and just when I thought TV was dying here comes a series that would want me to cancel appointments and keep my date with my couch, but of course with coffee cause this show demands attention and you don't want to miss any words when Mr.Homes is doing is lighting paced analysis. :) Watch it for the sheer pleasure and the joy of re-living on "Baker Street".
