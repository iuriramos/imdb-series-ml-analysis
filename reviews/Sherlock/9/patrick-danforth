Great acting, stories, and loads of fun. I have a love hate with how short the seasons are but I think that is what makes this so good and also what makes it work. I think if it were a longer season it would not hold up as well, being shorter I believe helps them make a strong story and adds quality to the show. Sometimes quantity can water things down. Freeman and Cumberbatch work well together, I couldn't think of a finer pair. Andrew Scott as Moriarty excels, he is crazy and sane in one breath. I do hope he does come back, how could he not? The writers have a great way of letting you think one thing and blindside you with something else. I hope this continues for many more seasons.
