In the world of popular entertainment, that happens slightly less frequently than a sighting of Halley's comet. And the second series is even better than the first. The use of OSG feels less like a crutch and more a terrific creative device and the weakest point of the adaptations, the updating of the relationship with the police, is much less of an issue. The quality of the episodes in both series is never less than very good, with even the weakest incorporating moments of sheer genius. The best episodes are staggeringly, jaw-droppingly good. A Scandal in Belgravia may just be the very best English language, entertainment TV yet produced, despite its imperfections. Casting is fundamentally very strong. Holmes, Watson, Mycroft and Moriarty are perfect, the police less so. As I've said, that's much less of an issue in the second series. And there are hidden treasures amongst the secondary or non-regular characters. Sebastien in the Blind Banker and Jim in A Study in Pink are just two that come to mind. On the other hand, Irene Adler in A Scandal in Belgravia didn't convince me that she was Holmes' intellectual equal. I want to put that criticism into perspective. We're not talking Rachel McAdams levels of laughable miscasting. This is something more subtle. The last episode of Series 2, The Reichenbach Fall, was in some ways the most conventional. Compare it to Scandal in Belgravia and you'll see what I mean. Not disappointing but very slightly pedestrian, mainly because the police have a larger role. Still better than anything else you'll find on TV, though. Treasure this series. You won't see anything this good again for a long, long time. Thoughts on a third series? We know there's to be one. It was commissioned at the same time as the second. I can't imagine how the writers will maintain the quuality. I just hope they don't fall into the trap of popularising it. The title of the show is Sherlock.
