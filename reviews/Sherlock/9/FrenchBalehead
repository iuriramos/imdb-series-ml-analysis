At first, I admit I was kidda reserved concerning the fact that this Sherlock would be set in the 21st century. Well, it is a masterpiece ! It is actually cool to see how Sherlock would be in our world !

This TV show is great. Great performance from the entire cast, great suspense, hilarious moments, no CGI / Kung Fu fighting here. The main weapon of Sherlock is his brain, and damn he is fast !

9/10 

ps: I personally think that the 1H20 episodes format permits the story of each episode to be more interesting, engaging and we get more into the mind of our protagonist. 

Just wished it was longer !
