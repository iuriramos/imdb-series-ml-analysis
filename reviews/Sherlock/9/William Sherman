An Excellent and Riveting Crime Show

Besides the cheesy summary, BBC's Sherlock is one of the best television crime shows. I personally love crime television shows, and of all the different programs, Sherlock is by far the best. It is able to maintain all the excitement of a normal mystery show with an addition of intelligence and high quality plot.

For every different type of television viewer, there are parts of the show to appeal. The show has thrilling mystery, good action, some drama, and excellent humor. Every episode has an original story and the endings are never predictable. No matter what Sherlock does, if it is investigating a missing glowing bunny or hanging out in a crack den, you will be surprised. To keep the attention of viewers, the show always presents jaw dropping scenarios and dramatic situations. The movement of the episodes is fast paced, with action keeping the viewers on their feet. The humor especially is very intelligent and sophisticated as opposed to the very raunchy humor featured in most television programs.

Sherlock is also broadcasted differently than many other television programs. Each episode is an hour and a half as opposed to the usual thirty minutes or an hour. These longer episodes make room for a more sophisticated plot. Some people do have difficulty with being able to fit these long episodes into one sitting, and sometimes have a difficult time retaining all the information. This show is made to have the audience think about what is happening, so this can't be considered a simple form of entertainment. Sherlock is able to bring all the usual elements of a television program, with an extra handful of intelligence and sophistication, which is well worth the cost of time. 

Also, it's a BBC program with Benedict Cumberbatch. What else could you expect?
