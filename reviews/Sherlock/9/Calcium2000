I knew the reviews for this were great and I watched it with high hopes and I must say, I was not disappointed one bit. I may even go to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Benedict Cumberbatch is growing in fame which I think is right, especially after his great success in Sherlock. He obviously was able to sink into the character and made him likable despite his natural cruelness. In this series (differentiating it from the American Movie) when Sherlock Holmes explains something he actually seems smart as appose to seeming to point out the obvious. Plus all his explanations are believable and apply to the clues that he uses. I think Cumberbatch was born to play this role. Having also seen him in the recent star trek into darkness (in which he is also an extreme character) I can tell that he can easily adjust to being different. I think the scripts are well written and fit naturally in the present day but still hold an old feeling that most crimes have to be solved with the human brain (although this is well integrated with the use of technology). Martin Freeman also, in my opinion, shines also in this TV series. I think that in many films that he does he can fail to be that expressive and come across as slightly normal. Though in this he gets a connection with Bennedict and I think he was given this opportunity with his less than ordinary and more deep character (as appose to the hobbit where he plays the extremely average and easy to judge character: Bilbo Baggins). In the later stages, Jim Moriaty as insane but is still a human character. I won't go too much into him though because you need to watch every one and make your own decisions. Don't be put off by the feature length episodes, the momentum is carried through right to the end of each one. Thankyou for reading.
