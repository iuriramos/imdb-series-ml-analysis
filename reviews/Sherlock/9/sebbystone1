I can't say that series 1 (7/10) was fantastic. It was on par with the Guy Richie Sherlock films, but I was feeling generous with the 7/10. Then series 2 (10/10) and 3 (10/10) come along. Mind blowing. With much better stories and characters, each episode in series 2 got better, with the 3rd being perhaps the greatest episode of a TV series I've ever seen. Series 3 followed up with more or less the standard anyone who had seen series 2 could expect. With even more story and characters, I was shocked when I learned that series 4 would be a couple of years away. The episodes follow armature detectives Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, in 21st century London. With multiple other characters from the Sherlock books appearing (Mycroft, Moriarty, Irene etc) it somehow all molded together excellently. What else is good about the second and third series apart from, EVERYTHING? Oh yeah, great soundtrack and really compelling and surprising stories. 1 is somewhat, although the signature acting held up the somewhat slow episodes. The episodes are like mini movies (1 hours 30 minutes), but well worth it. Summary: Series 1: 7/10, Good Series 2 and 3: 10/10, Near Perfect
