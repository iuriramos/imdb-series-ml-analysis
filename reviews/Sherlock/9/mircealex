I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, I've red many of his adventures written by Conan Doyle and I've watched all the movies related to Sherlock. When I had first seen this title I thought it will be another screening of Sherlock's adventures, this time on a new TV Series. But it was something different, it was an original way, a modern way of telling us the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a way that is related to our times. I really hope the show will go on because you can't get bored watching it. Fortunately,the producers can easily find many adventures in Conan Doyle's book to exploit and make again something worth to be watched. "Sherlock" is certainly a must-see and a delightful show, especially if you have red the book.
