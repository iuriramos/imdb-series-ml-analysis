When I first heard that the BBC's new version of the Sherlock Holmes story was to be set in modern day London I thought it would probably be just gimmicky and not that good but as the previews were complimentary I decided to give it a go. I'm glad that I did as it proved to be a lot of fun. Benedict Cumberbatch was great as the eponymous detective and if anything Martin Freeman was even better as Dr John Watson his assistant. The mysteries contained many clues that it took the great man to solve but there were just enough were the viewer could work something out first. At only three episodes the series was rather short but I'm sure further series will be commissioned soon; after all we didn't even get to see Moriarty till the end of the final episode and that ended at a municipal swimming pool not the Reichenbach Falls.

Unless one is a Holmes purist this should appeal to most viewers who like detective fiction. The cast put in fine performances, both major and minor characters. The only character I was unsure about was Moriarty who seemed far too emotional to me but as he was only really in one scene it is a bit too soon to judge. While there were obviously plenty of murders nothing too gory was shown so it should be suitable to for everybody apart from young children.
