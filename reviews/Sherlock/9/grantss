A modernised series of adaptations of the Sherlock Holmes novels by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. John Watson (played by Martin Freeman), an army doctor, is wounded in Afghanistan and invalided out of the Army. Back in London his search for a place to stay leads him to share a flat with Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant but eccentric private detective. Together they solve baffling, and often bizarre, murder mysteries. They also have to compete with Holmes' nemesis, the criminal genius Moriarty.

Great series. The contemporisation of the novels is very well done, with the stories fitting effortlessly into modern times and not feeling gimmicky at all. Smart scripts and deft direction make for great intrigue and engagement plus some sharp humour too. Moreover, each episode does not occur in isolation - there's an overarching plot that connects all the episodes and keeps you coming back for more.

Excellent performances by Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman as Watson. They seem perfect for the roles. Cumberbatch as the uber-intelligent yet socially awkward Holmes, Freeman as the jaded, practical Watson. Great supporting cast too: Una Stubbs as Mrs Watson, Rupert Graves as DI Lestrade, Mark Gatiss as Mycrodt Holmes and Louise Brealey as Molly Hooper. Stand out performance, however, goes to Andrew Scott as Moriarty - over-the-top, clever, evil and funny, all at the same time.
