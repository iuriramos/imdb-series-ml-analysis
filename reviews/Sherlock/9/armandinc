This show really surprised me. As of never hearing about this "Benedict Cumberbatch" until the latest Star Trek movie, I was skeptical about him as Sherlock Holmes. But all I can say is WOW. This guy is freaking brilliant. I've never seen a such amazingly complex Sherlock Holmes on screen. As a fan of the classic stories, I really am satisfied that this show portrays Sherlock with all his wit and genius with a modern and very pleasing twist. Sherlock and Watson are quite likable, and the crimes they solve are so unique and wonderful that this show stands out more than all the other murder mysteries. The first season is brilliant, but the second literally blew me away, (particularly the premiere). So I strongly recommend you check this one out, it clearly lets you in to the genius mind of one of the most complex and plain awesome minds of literature.
