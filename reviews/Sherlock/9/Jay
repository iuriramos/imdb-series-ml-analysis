Sherlock Holmes has been my childhood hero. Among all superheroes I have read/watched He stands out high. He is no super hero but not from this planet either...

I always wanted to know how would Sherlock Holmes solve mysteries had he been in this era...My wish has come true...Full credits to the creators.. A perfect tribute to the original SH.

And the ways Benedict depicts Sherlock is amazing. Depicting Sherlock is not a joke. Because people already have His image in their heart..

A must watch for all crime, thriller lovers.. Cant wait for the season three... ...........................

Now i start with season three...In one word a complete disappointment. First episode focus on the reunion of Sherlock and Watson. A drama was expected and was done with elan. Though nothing much on investigation side.

The second episode goes to my worst ever list. It acted like a sleeping pill to me. No intensity, no fun - a kind of marriage party. Moreover there is drunken Sherlock trying to solve a case and after all these an abnormal explanation of door-locked-from-inside-murder.

The third episode was picked up a little but yet no way near to any of the episodes on first two seasons. there are lot of unexplained answers which you will definitely find in a moment if you are a true Sherlock an fan. 

At the end showing Moriarty is coming back for 4th season...WHY??? Isn't he dead? What is this? Sherlock jumps and came back in 3rd season. Fine. Now Moriarty also coming back in 4th season...Not fine. What next? Magnussen coming back in 5th??

Not waiting for next season....

But I would recommend every one to watch the first two season and give rest a slip.
