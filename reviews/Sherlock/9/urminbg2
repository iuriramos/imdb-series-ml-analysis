Sherlock is such an amazing series that actually made me feel like 'I AM SHERLOCKED'. Yes, I am Irine Adler... LOL.. Excellent Casting, Awesome DOP, Nice and Witty Dialogues along with smart direction make Sherlock best ever series. In every season, I feel like I am getting again three movies all together! Oh! Editing and Pre plus Post production should have credit as well I guess. The modern version of sherlock holmes and John Watson, their activities and solving crimes together- this whole package is so innovative! Like the idea of 'people talking' that they are gay! LOL, I really love this series a lot. It gave me excellent entertainment! my Fav dialogue: "Don't make people into heroes, John. Heroes don't exist, and if they did, I wouldn't be one of them." " Honey u should See me in Crown!" SH: U are Insane JM: you're just getting that now !
