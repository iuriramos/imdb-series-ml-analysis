This is by far one of the best TV series that I have seen and I have seen many series and films!!! I recommend it to any TV lovers and although it is very different to the original books, it is a great adaptation!!! The series is good for people who like to think and keep their brain working. Its funny and adventurous yet simpler than the books and easier for some people to understand. 

I have seen a few Sherlock films but none of them are as good as this series!!! I can't wait for season four. 

The cast is perfect and I love the fact that many of the actors are related making the Sherlock characters seem so realistic! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜„ðŸ˜ƒ
