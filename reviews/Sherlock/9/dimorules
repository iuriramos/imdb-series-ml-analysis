at first i think this movie will not work as the setting is in the modern day. but it turns out the creator of this movie is very clever to combine the modern aspect with sherlock thriller and also put the soul from the book into the movie. its like you rebuild your memory about the original sherlok story into new setting. The actor is perfect even thought jim moriarty is a little bit quirky but i get the reason why they made him that way. more about to give a little spicy to the movie. and its work fine. Also if you already see season 2 episode 1, man, i think that was the best ending in any TV series that i ever watch. i repeat many times and i still get the thrill. i even claps :) Amazing. must see.
