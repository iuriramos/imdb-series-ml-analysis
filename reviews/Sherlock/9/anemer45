Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be delighted and very proud with the TV show, I honestly have not much more to say, It is a well made TV show, well researched, the character is exactly how Sherlock Holmes should be

I like that it its a modern version of the character, but clearly only in the time settings, Sherlock Holmes still as eccentric and old school as the guy from the books! he is funny, intelligent, watchful, etc Lets hope for many more seasons to come, and hours of endless entertainment to come and lets hope Harstwood films feels as proud as they should for producing this show

I really enjoyed watching the TV show, and I hope they make some more like it!
