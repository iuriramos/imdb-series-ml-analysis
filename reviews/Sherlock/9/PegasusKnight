A 9.3 For First Season And 9.5 for Season 2.

First of all an important note ,people who have missed this need to know that its just because of less advertisement of this series...but this series completely outwits other Sherlock Holmes series and movies of all times..

Personally i don't like the brilliant novels of Sir Aurthur Canon Doyle to be spoiled by any poor cinematic projection and especially not a modernized version.....but No this series completely passes this arguments and is a must watch for all Sherlock fans and mystery lovers..

The whole plot and events take place in modern day London where The great Sherlock Holmes and Dr.Watson solve mystery cases just like novels.All the episodes are based on novels but whats new is brilliant conversion of script to suite modern times without altering anything in the main story moreover leaving it with a brilliant touch.BBC team of Sherlock has uniquely used modern techniques to enhance the imagery projection of Sherlock so that you can feel more closeness towards his way of looking towards crime scenarios and other preceding events. events.Benedict Cumber batch(Sherlock) and Martin Freeman(Dr.Watson) have beautifully and artistically portrayed their roles and their acting is just Sublime.All the other characters have also acted very very well in the series.Each episodes runs for 90 minutes which gives each of them enough time to represent versatile details of Sherlock and Watson adventures.The first season was surprisingly excellent and the second one incredibly brilliant.The character of Moriarty is so amazingly played by Andrew Scott that his performance in last episode of season two left me completely speechless,he even surpasses Sherlock(Benedict)there. Overall its completely outstanding to invest any money or time....just go for it.I only get upset with lesser number of episode in each season,only three but yes each season covers about seven and half hour which is not that bad....but still i wished to see more of this series. (season 3 in 2013)....
