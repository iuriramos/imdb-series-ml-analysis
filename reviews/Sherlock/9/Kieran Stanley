What an incredible experience to watch. I have fell out of touch several times just to get pulled right back in. Its fast pace, diverse characters and awesome plot lines solidify this show as one of the greatest of our time and maybe of all time. Every shot carefully crafted and can be analyzed for references and secrets to past stories or characters. I especially love the theme song and the incredible sound makes you love the mystery and Holmes' deductions. It can create moments that make you want to cheer. The relationship between Holmes and Watson is incredible chemistry and the actors are the greatest friends ever on television. In conclusion, this is a series that will make you want to go and read the original books and theorize for hours.
