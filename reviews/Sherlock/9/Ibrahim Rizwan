A contemporary spin on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary detective, Sherlock follows the famous sleuth solving mysteries in modern day London.

The titular character is played to perfection by Benedict Cumberbatch in a career defining role. Cumberbatch is highly meticulous, surprisingly patronizing and exudes a cavalier demeanor. Providing the perfect balance is Martin Freeman as Holmes' reliable aide, Dr. John Watson. The latter's mild-mannered depiction is the ideal foil for the former's arrogance.

Besides the efficient chemistry shared by the actors, the story telling; format; and direction also exceed expectations. For instance, Holmes' astute observations and scientific deductions are executed exceptionally. The interpretation to a 21st century setting is seamless and also pays homage to classic cases featuring the fictional investigative duo. A sublime blend of acting and writing ensure an engrossing and compelling watch.

Sherlock combines suspense, drama and comedy in equal measure. The renowned detective is also featured in other mediums currently but Sherlock has cemented the 19th century literary character's place as a pop culture phenomenon.
