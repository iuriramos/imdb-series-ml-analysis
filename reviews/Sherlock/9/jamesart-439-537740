One of my 'must see' shows, and there are VERY few of them.

Modern day Sherlock and his faithful companion.

Brilliant story lines. Brilliant Acting. Pretty much everything brilliant.

First 2 series were particularly brilliant, with Moriarty bringing weird, camp, malevolence to the scene.

The third series, while equally great on the acting and story sides, let itself down ever so slightly, by the over use of gimmicky editing.

I hope the upcoming 4th series leaves that aside and continues with the simply brilliance that is Sherlock.

Cannot recommend highly enough for fans of Sherlock Holmes, mysteries and great television in general.
