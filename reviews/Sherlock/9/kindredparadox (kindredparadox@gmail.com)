"Sherlock" will definitely entertain all criminal investigation film fans. Honestly although I enjoyed "Sherlock Holmes" (2009), It isn't the one I was looking for because it involves too much Action, plus too much weird technologies. "Sherlock" does look like stealing the idea of Stills of Information, though it used in the right part which we really want to know more (for idiot like us? lol), instead being annoying it helps to amuse us and makes us keep guessing the mystery (Isn't this what suppose to be in this kind of film?). Surely other classics of Sherlock Holmes never done something similar like that.

At first part of Episode One where Sherlock amazed you with his deduction, I thought it's too much to the point it seems silly (We already know he's genius). But then it's all good again. And right, joke parts will surely make you laugh, not like "Castle".

It's better than other criminal investigation series and for me personally it's better than the Movie. Can you believe it's only a TV series? Don't miss this one.
