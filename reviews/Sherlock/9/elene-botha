I am a huge Robert Downey Junior as Sherlock Holmes fan and was therefore very skeptical of not only the lead in this series, but also the concept behind it. Relocating Sherlock Holmes to the 21st century, for me, was going to be the end of him, but this brilliantly thought out series did justice to Holmes in a way it has not been done before. The most interesting character, for me, in this adaption is non other than Watson, who as a war veteran perfectly displays Watson's brooding character which in turn then makes him such a worthy companion for Holmes.I praise the makers of this series, the lead actors and of course the people who adapted Holmes to the 21st century. Bravo Certainly a must-see!
