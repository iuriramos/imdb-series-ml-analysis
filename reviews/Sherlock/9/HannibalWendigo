This show is a modern take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic Sherlock Holmes series. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Sherlock and Watson. The show is amazing. It has great acting from both Cumberbatch and Freeman as well as its other actors. The plots are amazing. They take stories like A Study in Scarlet or The Hounds of Baskerville and put a modern twist on it. Even if you don't like Doyle's Sherlock series you will probably still love this. I don't want to spoil it so I won't say much more, but I would recommend this to not only fans of the book series, but to just really anybody. I give it a 9/10 and any high-functioning sociopath will love it.
