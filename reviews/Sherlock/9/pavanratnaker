Its simply awesome how they've constructed the story here with the old detective working away in today's times with modern gadgets and science...superb..have to give it to the story writers here. The titles used are of the original Conan Doyle stories and they try to stick to the theme of the original story but with such a refreshing touch to it that it almost seems like a original new story. Cumberbatch is simply amazing in the role , the seriousness , the style just makes the whole series . Ably aided by Mr Watson as he should be who does a pretty good job. Direction and editing is great and makes it a drama full of pace. For fans of mystery and drama it's amuse watch. For Sherlock Holmes fans its again a must watch, it's a new makeover but the charm remains.
