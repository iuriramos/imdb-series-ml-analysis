As an avid fan of Sherlock Holmes from a young age, my first thought when hearing about yet another screen adaptation was not a positive one. I felt like I had seen it all: the cheesy deerstalker imitations, the overused quotes, and of course, the common misinterpretation of Sherlock Holmes as an action hero. Though they were far from terrible, I always found myself verging on boredom. How different could BBC's Sherlock really be? The thing I didn't see coming was how far from the truth my expectations were. Much to my delighted surprise, Sherlock brought the same fast- paced, engaging adventure found in Conan Doyle's stories to a modern setting. I am happy to say that I have never once found myself forwarding through an episode or discovering a criminal before he is revealed. Though the seemingly endless waiting period between seasons of just three episodes each may sound unappealing to some, there is a reason so many followers are willing to pay that price. Each episode is packed full of intriguing plot and action, not to mention the clever scripting. Along with Benedict Cumberbatch's dark yet charismatic portrayal of Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman's take on Watson, I find myself hard- pressed to find flaw with the series. If there is one thing I should warn you about, it is to not start watching Sherlock until you have a weekend or so of uninterrupted time. Once you start, you won't be able to stop.
