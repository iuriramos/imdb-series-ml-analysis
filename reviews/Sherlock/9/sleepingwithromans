Wow, I had watched an episode in school and it was just so intense for a show that was to be shown in school. At first glance, I thought I would doze off, but it was impossible with the storyline and just everything. Oh I'm insane about their accents also! It'd be hilarious when our class would go nuts if the volume turned off, it was just so riveting. It just got me hooked Sherlock is just amazing with his way of thinking and how the show projects his train of thought. I just need to ask one question, what channel does this come on? I've scrolled through countless times on the bbc channel and nothing. Im subscribed to Dish, so Id love if someone could tell me. Also wondering should I watch the sherlock holmes movies?
