The first time I heard about 'Sherlock' was browsing through Amazon while surfing for DVDs. It said pre-order, with 3 episodes; the description said Holmes in modern setting?

Being a fan I was amused and thought of it being a spoof or at best a paltry effort of belittling the first action hero. But I watched a study in pink, and was swept off my feet. The way the writers intermeshed single Sherlock adventures into bits and pieces of an original storyline was admirable. The way they replaced Holmes ability to deduct the drinking habit of a man by observing a watch to observing a mobile phone was non-intrusive and sublime. So was the way Holmes explained his brain was a hard-drive, a modern take on the attic of the old. Such examples are plenty in the series, and true fans would recognize them and love the way they were built in.

The plots were of course a stew of multiple Holmes story, but they were strung by a gifted craftsman in a delicate way. The Blind Banker kept the appetite up and then The Great Game left me breathless.

It was a superb climax, Moriarty was brilliant. A worthy adversary. I can't stop thinking what they will do next, I hope they continueplease don't stop now.

This has been the best effort in years!!!
