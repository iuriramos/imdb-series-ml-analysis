Sherlock is a show based on the famous consulting detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner John Watson, whom were both created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 19th Century. This show is a modern take on the cases they solve as well as their relationship throughout their time together.

The story in this show is absolutely second to none. Each episode is both intriguing and intelligent and it's almost immediately obvious that this show has some of the best writing you've ever seen. There are genuine twists that you won't see coming and the dialogue in each episode is superb. The humour in this show suits the tone set by the writers perfectly and I simply cannot fault the story or writing in this show at all.

From his mannerism's, to his look, to his relationship with the ever loyal John Watson (who is also played brilliantly by Martin Freeman), Benedict Cumberbatch absolutely nails this modern take on Sherlock Holmes. All of the supporting cast are great and add their bit of charisma as well. There isn't a single poorly acted or unlikeable character in this entire show.

The score in this show is also fantastic. The music is high-strung and quirky which suits Sherlock's idiosyncratic behaviour perfectly.

There really isn't anything bad to say about Sherlock except perhaps that a couple of the episodes are a little weaker than the others, but that being said they are still an entertaining watch.

Sherlock Holmes is one of my favourite characters and Benedict Cumberbatch has given me my favourite on screen version of the famous sleuth yet. If you haven't seen this show, please be aware you are missing out on some absolutely brilliant viewing.
