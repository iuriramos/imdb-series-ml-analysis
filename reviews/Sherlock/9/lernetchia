There are so many crime TV series around that they are actually becoming quite stale, the plot is almost always the same with little variation. However, Sherlock breathes new life to this dying genre of shows. I think it's brilliantly done, the pace is very fast. As much as each episode is almost an hour and a half long, the plot never drags. 

I particularly enjoy Sherlock's dialogs as he speaks really fast and his quirky manner that rubs everyone the wrong way. Although it has only been 3 episodes, excluding the original pilot, I am already addicted to this series. 

But there is no such thing as perfect. The only one thing I find a little unpleasant is that some of the side characters have poor acting skills. A couple of them are so bad I nearly cringed. Other than that, I must say I love this show!
