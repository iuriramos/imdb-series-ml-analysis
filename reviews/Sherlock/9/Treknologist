This is a perfect example of how TV should be done! First of all, the casting is great. Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock Holmes) and Martin Freeman (Dr. John Watson) revolutionize their roles and bring a lot of great wordplay and good chemistry to this series. Andrew Scott as James Moriarty is great as well, although Mr. Scott brings some unneeded eccentricity to the role. Lara Pulver plays her role very well, too. The music is great, especially in "A Scandal in Belgravia" and "The Reichenbach Fall". Lots of really great musicianship going on and you can tell everyone puts a lot of work into their job. The entire atmosphere of 221B is styled wonderfully with lots of bold color and cool decorations. Many of the educational, forensic, historical, etc. facts are quite accurate and you end up learning something every time. It's safe enough that younger kids can watch (except "A Scandal in Belg." and maybe "Reichenbach"), although they might get bored after a while. Also, I really, really enjoy the 90-minute-episode format, because it makes each episode feel like a movie. Everything, right down to the camera-work, costumes, and makeup/hair design is great. The only negative is the long, Long, incredibly LOOOOOOONG waits between series, but it's understandable since the stars are in demand now. Can't wait till series 3!:)
