This series is clearly not made for a one time view. Everything is brilliant about this series. Powerful acting+script. Benedict Cumberbatch has got to be one of the best portrayals of Sherlock (I've actually only watched two - Hope you guessed the other one - Deduction). But what even exciting is the build up. Every episode is taken to a perfect spot and completed. Next episode,next case not like other series where you have to wait and watch and hopefully connect them. And the reason why i ask you to buy the DVD is because of this

-----The Science Of Deduction-----

If you watch sherlock episodes again,you will notice a lot of things you normally miss out.Thats what makes the series special. You are made to watch the episode again with more curiosity and you are not disappointed. Clearly, sherlock speaks fast so you are not meant to understand everything at first sight. So when you go over them again a second time, you'll be like Ahh(No pun intended with Scandal at Belgravia)! Now it makes sense or That's why.Every episode is a movie long but With powerful editing+beautiful score, generates a certain flow and you are simply washed down by it.Plus (Enough with the pluses already) by giving a case within a case (I call it case-ception) scenario, you are clearly not given enough time to think, and the suspense is delivered with a punch.And when it does hit you,it's not a " that's so obvious" either (well, at least not always). 

Okay, Minuses (This is only for me) I hate the portrayal of James Moriarty,again just how he is portrayed, not that its a bad acting but just doesn't seem to suit the series, Moriarty has to be the opposite of Sherlock, not behave like a psychopath and the war sequence in the beginning. Ruins the masterpiece.
