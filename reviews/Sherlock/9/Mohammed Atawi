If you're looking for an inspiring Character and unbelievably genius story lines , you have got to watch this series !!! Sherlock in this TV show is the most mysterious and clever character I have ever seen in British tili !

What made me grabbed by the nick is how the story seems impossible to solve , and yet , it get figured in a ( believable ) way , unlike some crime shows or novels , its the priceless core of this TV show .

At some points in every single episode I get too excited that I cant wait any longer to watch Sherlock figuring it out ! if you have 90 minutes as spare time , watch one episode and you'll never get bored ..
