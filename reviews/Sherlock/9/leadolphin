Sherlock is my new favourite show! Unfortunately, I've run out of episodes. That's the one thing I don't like about this show, there are only 3 episodes per season. Sherlock is a very quirky character. He's like able, but he's very rude. He often makes foot in the mouth comments. Watson is great. Oh, and by the way, if you've seen any of the shows, did you notice that Martin Freeman is a lefty? Anyway, Watson is perfect! In the Basil Wrath Bone (I think That's right...) movies, Watson is old, and bumbling. This Watson is clever, although not near the level of Sherlock.

There are several funny aspects to the show. For example, Watson found a head in the fridge (which was later discovered by Mrs. Hudson) in the fridge, fingers in the fridge, and eyeballs in the microwave. Sherlock also causes several out of place things to say ie "Your brother forgot his pants", "If you'll excuse me, I left my riding crop in the morgue." and other strange out of place things. I always like a good suspenseful show that's edge of your seat the whole time, but funny too. 

This is a great revival of Sherlock Holmes. I don't know what to make of the American one, since Watson is a woman and the whole reason Watson and Sherlock meet is because they can't afford to pay apartment rent. Oh, and if you're wondering about what age this is appropriate for, I'd say about 9 and up. Depending on the episode.

All in all, great show, and great representation of the best detective ever. Can't wait for the third season to come out on Netflix!
