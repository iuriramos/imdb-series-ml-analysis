I have been a fan of Holmes since I was a kid and when I heard about this "updating", I was convinced that the BBC would make a hash of it. As a fan of the Jeremy Brett series, I did not consider that taking Holmes out of his Victorian environment would be a good idea. How wrong I was! 

I found the first episode of this series to be enormously entertaining, not least Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Holmes. In removing Holmes from his Victorian roots Cumberbatch has, ironically, delivered the closest portrayal yet to Conan Doyle's original character. An eccentric genius just on the right side of being a complete weirdo. Cumberbatch also brought out Holmes' physicality, charisma and masterfulness. It was great to watch. I hope the next episodes are as entertaining as this.
