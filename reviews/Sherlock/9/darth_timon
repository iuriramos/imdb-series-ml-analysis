Sometimes taking something out of its original setting can fail quite badly. Not everything can survive this. However Sherlock succeeds quite brilliantly, though this is perhaps as much due to the performances of the cast as the setting itself.

First of all, there is no getting around the performance of Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock himself. It's excellent. The arrogance, the intelligence, the social incompetence- it's all delivered with precision and wit that only confirms Cumberbatch's status as a superb actor. He makes the show what it is, though he is not alone at giving good performances.

Andrew Scott as Moriarty manages that same intellectual prowess but with him it's wrapped up in a man who is on the edge of madness- he crackles with energy one moment and contains a cold, quiet malice the next.

Martin Freeman gives us the insight into Sherlock's world from the perspective of the long-suffering John Watson, who is not stupid by any means but is often made to feel that way as Sherlock sees details no one else can spot- yet at the same time Watson brings a little humility and awareness to Sherlock- patiently, despite so much frustration! The writing is brilliant. Intricate cases, with several threads woven into them, with solutions as ingenious as the crimes themselves. This is one of the best shows to come out of the BBC in years.
