BBC's Sherlock is the best thing to hit television in years. Where the latest film releases of the Sherlock franchise were Jack Sparrow vs. Batman and a lot of explosives put together in a likable visual package the 2010 BBC series Sherlock is an engaging, unique yet traditional, detective drama. 

Likable characters, interesting cases, intelligent plot, high production value and relatability make this series something we will enjoy for many years to come. Both Sherlock and Dr. Watson are played to perfection. Martin Freeman (Watson) is both likable and relatable and an excellent counter-character against the raging intelligence train that is Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock. Never before has Sherlock Holmes been portrayed in such a thrilling, interesting and engaging way. 

My hopes for this series are high and it deserves a great deal of attention.
