So far I don't see the horrible and obvious directional and continuity gaps of MI5 and Commander. Moffat is a powerful writer who can do great things for the series. However,I personally don't think that Holmes' equal nor his attraction should be to a dominatrix. That is a cheap shot to attract viewers and that's partly why I only gave a 9 for a rating. But at least in her first appearance in the series, her "activities" were mostly suggested rather than played out. 

Holmes' boyish zeal for "the game" could get old unless he grows in the part. Watson should not be put in the role of a comedian so much, it's pretty clear that he is smart and can learn about the ways that Holmes thinks and therefore needs to grow in the part too. Moriarty does not act like a superior villain. That's another problem. Unless these issues are addressed, the show will lose its values by the end of season 2 or 3. The typical pattern of more villains showing up just to challenge Holmes is another potential problem because that can get old just like it does in the comic books. I saw a glimmer that this might be a future pattern based on the attention his website is starting to draw. 

Otherwise, I think it's amazing to see Holmes brought forward so successfully. Heh - now how about a visit from the Doctor, so he can travel back and solve a problem in Olde England?
