As a huge fan of crime, apprehension, and punishment, this series is spot-on and leads the pack, big screen or small. At the risk of being called a bit of a snob, this British work needs to be viewed with pleasure and attention, as walking away for 5-minutes (unlike some of the current crop of action / cops thrillers), these episodes are brain food. Each story brings a new and compelling adventure for Sherlock and Doctor Holmes. Additionally, none of the plots are rehashes of other stories, either from Britain, or across the pond. Superb. You won't want to miss a second - because the story lines move at warp speed, as Sherlock applies his gift of observation and detection so adroitly, you'll be pleased, stunned, and truly entertained. My hope is that this creation will not be just a flash-in-the-pan, but a continued offering from our British friends.
