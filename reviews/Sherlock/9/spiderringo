I am a fan of all things Sherlock. It would be easy for me to dislike a new version that strayed from the Doyle format. I am NOT disappointed. I am thrilled! As many have said, I was hooked 5 minutes into the first episode. This series is a keeper. Why are we waiting for more than THREE EPISODES????????? Things I love about Sherlock...

The actors are hitting it out of the park! Cumberbatch is perfect. I wish he and Honeysuckle Weeks would marry to have wonderfully named children. ;) Martin Freeman has a difficult character to flesh out, but he's made it so much more than any other Dr. Watson so far, and that's meant to be a huge compliment. His handicapped to hero theme rocks.

Mycroft, Lastrade, Sally (Freak) the cop, and of course Mrs. Hudson. I am hoping for much more Moriarty. I love this show. MORE EPISODES!!!!

A large part of Holmes is his hometown, London. Each book, TV series and movie have made their attempt to show viewers the grand scope of this Victorian metropolis. Sherlock's take is one of the best so far. I loved the cab vs foot chase scene. Sherlock is going to take us on some grand adventures through the streets he knows by heart and I want to.

The modern theme is well done as well. I like his use of smart phones, computers, and data bases to mimic Holme's well stocked library. It's still just tools wielded by that marvelous brain to sort out the clues.

The gimmick of text confirmation of clues is also a welcome visual treat. Creators Gatiss and Moffat have crafted a gritty, moody series, with streets and interiors both creepy and full of character. 

In short, I would like to order 100 more episodes asap. Viva Sherlock!

A fan in the states watching on PBS.
