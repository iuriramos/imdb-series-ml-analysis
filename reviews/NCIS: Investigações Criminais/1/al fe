I love the show, and my friends like it too. We speak other languages, and we are very surprised, however, why NCIS movie cannot be produced utilizing native speakers of other languages. For instance, the Russian language is horrible in all the episodes it was used. I am sure Russians would be happy to lend you a hand, and the show would be more credible if native speakers were used. Native Russian speakers should be selected not from so-called Russian experts in DC, who just studied the language, but could never master the accent or cannot use correct grammar - they should be selected from Brighton Beach or Russian-speaking communities around the country. There are plenty of those in the USA. But, again, most Hollywood productions suffer from this flaw, which leads to great disappointments...
