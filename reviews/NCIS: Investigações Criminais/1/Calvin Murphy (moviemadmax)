Never watched a full episode, never will. Goth tattooed chick is a forensics "genius" in between hepatitis shots. Smart ass pretty boy gets beat up, but never looses any teeth. Non-British actors attempts playing nerdy pathologist, who acts like a lost chi-mo in the park. Then they parade a bugged-eyed monkey in a suit out to spit and sputter for some levity. All characters are simply "characters," faking their way through the next commercial. Zero story with even less "acting." But not near as bad as the Los Angeles spin off with the midget and Tu Pac licking his lips constantly. Whoever writes these CBS jewels never graduated high school. The truth hurts ratings sometimes, but NCIS stands for Nothing Can Interest Stupidity.
