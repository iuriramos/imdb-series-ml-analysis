My mom watches this show religiously and I catch episodes here and there when I visit her and it is the most poorly written drivel I have ever seen in my life. 

It's unrealistic and the writing is childish and beyond stupid.

How this has lasted 6 seasons is beyond my reckoning.

Beyond the complete and utter lack of realism and disregard for the affluence of the potential audience, the characters are just boring. Each seems to have their own little quirk that defines their character and that's it. Some might say, "well if you watched more episodes you'd get the characters," and to that I say, "who cares."
