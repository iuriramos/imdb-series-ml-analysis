Recently sat through a virtual marathon of episodes from various seasons and came away disappointed and disbelieving. This show seems to have devolved to the low levels first achieved with "24" showing government agents doing bad things for good reasons. Suspects/witnesses are routinely subjected to insults, lies and in many instances physical abuse to achieve ends. Superiors, agents of similar agencies and other services as well as local law enforcement are routinely treated with ill-disguised contempt if not outright disdain.

It is doubtful that any of the cases "solved" by this group would get by a grand jury let alone result in conviction in a full blown trial, given their intimidation tactics and routine lack of warrants for searches. In one episode, David, the Israeli Mossad agent, is left alone to physically torture a female office employee with the knowing consent of her boss, Gibbs. In another, she kicks a handcuffed male suspect in the groin. In other episodes, Gibbs and his fellow agents lie to and threaten American citizens and legally resident aliens with indefinite detention in Guantanamo.

Some may find this kind of show wishfully entertaining. One can only hope that it is not taken by foreign audiences as realistically representative of the U.S. legal system.
