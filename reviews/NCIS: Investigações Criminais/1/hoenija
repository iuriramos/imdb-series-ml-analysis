If you can look past Gibbs crappy haircut then you might actually be able to enjoy the show. But the bad haircut really is a major distraction. As written, it is not believable that any sane person would keep such a crummy haircut for 10+ years. There is no insight to why Gibbs wears his hair this way. I think the writers should write a flashback episode that reveals the mystery of Gibbs hair-do. I think it is lazy script writing to leave this matter unresolved and not understood. The truth is, none of the writers can come up with a legitimate reason for anyone to wear their hair like this. Gibbs seems to have everything in order except for his haircut. Why would he leave it this way. It does not reflect well on his character.
