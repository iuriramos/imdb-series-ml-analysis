Whatever the episode of NCIS with the child of an NCIS employee who was allegedly kidnapped was ABYSMAL. Why does Hollywood expect us to believe that old midgets are children? The kid wasn't precocious -- he was annoying. Children should act like children. And Mark Harmon "bonding" with him over Seattle's Best Coffee was pathetic. His character doesn't seem like the "I love kids, especially annoying, bossy types" kind of guy. Why isn't it okay to let children on TV act as children -- shy or confused would be acceptable qualities for this kid's character, but those weren't displayed. Instead, the kid came in as if he could run NCIS. I suppose with the buffoons currently employed on the show, he could. And the way he talked was more annoying than Lauren Holly's mouth movements. Mark Harmon acted as if he was a long-lost roommate. And he was allowed to run amok a highly classified joint. Just terrible. Won't watch the show again.
