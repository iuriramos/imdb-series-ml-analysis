I watch this show almost everyday on reruns because people in my family like it, and I must say that I don't know why. Almost everything about this show is cheesy, lame, repetitive and poorly thought out. The dialog is sub par at best. It seems like everyone likes the characters and I have not the slightest idea why. The only one one who is half decent is Dinozzo simply because he has no special character traits. Everyone else is a stereotype of a character that has been done to death in a million other shows. I just find that basically none of the characters interact well with one another. It is as if they took the main characters from their own shows and dropped them all together in NCIS. The result is that they are all too unique to create any kind of cohesion. Maybe once a show Dinozzo and Gibbs have a funny sequence of lines but every other time it is not funny and usually nonsensical, defying the way any humans would interact with each other. Not to mention countless instances of assault on the part of Gibbs towards his team, and the team in general towards suspects,terrorists etc. It all adds to the stupidity and unbelievability. So I guess I will continue tuning in because I am forced to... I wonder what the story will be next time? My money says that, wait let me guess, a member of the navy.... is murdered!!!!! Anyone wanna take that bet?
