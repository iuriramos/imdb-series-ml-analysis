When I tuned in to watch the show last night, I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out. Much to mu surprise, it was a good episode, especially the behavior and bonding father and son went through during the show. 

The show lacked a little something, but it kept my attention until the very end which makes it a good show.

I was a bit confused when Gibbs commented that he always sacks out on the couch-what's with that!

I'm hoping to hear Gibbs come up with some new rules this season.

Looking forward to the next episode.
