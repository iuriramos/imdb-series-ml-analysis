NCIS is very well done, and I love watching it on Saturday nights. Why? Because I like this sort of show, it interests me. What makes NCIS so watchable is that while it is nothing groundbreaking, it is strongly scripted, nicely plotted, well photographed, slickly directed, has some good acting particularly from Mark Harmon, has likable characters, has clever music and the character development is good. Some episodes might be slower than others, but the show is great to watch and I applaud it for doing something with a formula that is not that new anyway.

Overall, NCIS is an interesting watch. If you have a free weekend evening, by all means sit down and put your feet up and your dinner and get engrossed. 9/10 Bethany Cox
