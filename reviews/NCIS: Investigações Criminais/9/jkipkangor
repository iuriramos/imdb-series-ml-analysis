I am not sure why this title is not getting 10/10 rating because I can't really get enough of it! The characters, all of them will always have a fan out there, Gibbs as a character has always inspired me, especially when not mixing emotions regardless of how the situation is. The show's writers have done a wonderful job, to create and compress a 40 minute thriller on TV. The way the show starts cannot be imitated, short and precise. Though lots of fiction is involved with tech gigs around, it hasn't come to be a boring or a predictable show to me. NCIS encompasses all forms of crimes and despite the show being short, they try to show all the stages, errors made in the investigation makes the show 'believable'.
