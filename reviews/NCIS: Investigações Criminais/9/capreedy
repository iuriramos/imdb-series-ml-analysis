When series 3 finish airing on FX channel on UK satellite TV it began from scratch with series 1 episode 1 each week night.

From the first there was something different about the series. It was fresh and the story lines easy to follow. Bored with CSI which seemed to get heavier and heavier relying more on the forensics than plot, NCIS with its quirky characters grabbed my interest.

After 32 episodes I am well and truly hooked and look forward every evening to a dose of the tough, no holds barred Gibbs and co.

WHen I discovered that Donald P. Bellisario was the creator I knew I was in for a treat especially after being a fan of Quantum Leap.

Bravo
