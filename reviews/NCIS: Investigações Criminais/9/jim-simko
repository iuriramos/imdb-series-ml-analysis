I really enjoy NCIS. The story lines always contain a twist and the interaction between characters is enjoyable. The main problem in 2013 is the introduction of the "Bishop" character who I find very annoying. I do not think she adds anything to the story line and am not sure why she was added to group. Woulb be better if she just had a recurring role every so often, cannot see what she brings to show. It is like her character was added to try to appeal to a younger demographic. As the show has very high ratings at present why do this. What is her specialty? She uses analysis and thinks her way through a situation, wow! Really!! They already have the think and geek nerds why add another. Still like show but definitely a downgrade with this addition.
