I have seen several "cop-based" shows from "Hillstreet Blues(no I'm not that old;just twenty-eight here...saw the reruns) to "The Sentinel" from UPN, but this show was somewhat different. I mean it has the usual victim/criminal/cop element, but it also has what some of the other shows have....humor. I mean, Toney Denoso(something like that..anyway) is a riot and Abby is really cool. Even Mark Harmon's character of Gibbs is his moments. It doesn't have the s/f/x that CSI has and it may not have big-breasted drop-dead gorgeous women like some of these prime-time dramas may have-though Sasha Alexander comes very close to hot....for a cop-but those things don't really make good TV watching anyway. So give the show a try, you won't be disappointed.

Later....
