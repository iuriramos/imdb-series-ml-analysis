Virtually not a weak link in any character and episode.

Interesting plots, clever storyline and forensics and, above all, the dry humour reminds me of British humour, not the traditional pie-in-your-face style.

Mark Damon, as Jethro Gibbs, is a totally plausible leader.

The banter between DiNozzo (superbly acted by Michael Weatherly) and his female counterparts in Todd (Sasha Alexander) and then Ziva (Cote de Pablo) is funny and realistic.

Abby (Paulet Perrette) is superb as the weirdo technical wizz and is superbly offset by Ducky (David McCallum) the "doctor".

McGee (Sean Murray) is magical, despite the attempted put-downs and/or one-upmanship attempts by DiNozzo and (sometimes) Abby.

All in all, a remarkably watchable and interesting series - in some ways reminding me of MASH.
