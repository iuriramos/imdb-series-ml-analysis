One of the best TV series of all time. However:...

Regarding the original character - Anthony DiNozzo - and his farewell at the end of Season 13, I thought it was overly sentimental and weak. The character needed some grounding on the sentimental side after 12 plus seasons of drifting between attachments, but he was always the person-in-waiting for all fans to become the next #1 (Gibbs-like; or even better!) However, they short-changed his end story by making him a less than heroic - yes: admirable (but all the principal characters are by definition admirable) but Tony was the other Alpha and was with a severe suddenness made into a sedate Beta. Boo! Perhaps there will be a time to reestablish his character's true credibility in the future of the NCIS franchise - to the satisfaction of all - but time will tell, of course, as it always does.
