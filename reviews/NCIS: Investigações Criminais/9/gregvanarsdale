I've been watching the show from the first season. I'm a retired Naval officer, which explains my initial attraction. That in itself was not enough. What kept my attention and loyal viewing were a) plot content, b) acting, c) accurate forensic medicine and technology.

Strong points: There are many, just a few 1. The acting is seamless, which means the audience sees the character, not an actor playing a part. 2. Plots are interesting and vary with a nice diversity, making each show fresh and not feeling like you've seen this show before.

Weak points: 1. Every once in a while it seems the writers get in a bind. The result is plot holes and technical inaccuracies. 2. Personally, I wish they had kept Sasha Alexander on the show ('Kate Todd'). Her character as well as Sasha's natural look were much more believable than Cote de Pablo. Don't get me wrong. Cote is hands-down gorgeous -- but definitely on the petite, cute side. (and enough of that long-standing gag of a language barrier!) Sasha's good looks made her character more believable, like she really could bring a bad guy down. Her beauty was more mature, smart, self confident.

Summary: Very entertaining show that mixes drama (blood and death) with enough comedy to break the tension. The methods for solving the cases are enlightening and revealing and (for the most part) accurate.
