I just heard that Michael Weatherly is leaving the show. No more Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo. This sucks. Any episode (other then including father DiNozzo) that showcased Tony's skills and experience were great episodes. I wanted more involving story lines like this. This is the beginning of the end for NCIS. It was always going to happen, everyone thought it would be Mark Harmon leaving. I am hoping for a team of his own and relocation for Tony. A death for this character seems in bad taste. Or maybe a reunion with Ziva. Anyways, the loss of this actor and character is huge. Moving forward without Tony DiNozzo will be a huge challenge for the show.
