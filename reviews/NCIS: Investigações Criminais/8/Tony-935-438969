I am not as a rule a fan of American crime series, but this one is an exception. It has a nice balance of drama and humour, the characters are all entertaining and the interaction between them I think makes the series. I used to be a Crime scene investigator so it's probably this that caught my interest initially, the crime scene technicalities are a bit sci-fi but never the less fun to watch. This applies to both branches of the series, the Los Angeles version being a bit more Hollywood for my liking but still entertaining. The main characters are well established now, and some come and go to keep the storey lines fresh. All in all the series does stand out against the myriad of other crime series from America , And will continue to watch it. Tony.
