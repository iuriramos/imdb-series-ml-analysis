I haven't been watching the series since the beginning (2003), but I did manage to catch up in the last couple of months. I started from season 1 and now I'm a few episodes into season 11, and all I have to say is that something is bothering me! Every time one of the team members becomes close to forming a real intimate relationship, someone either gets shot, dies, leaves the country, is a traitor or is just forgotten. This goes for almost all of the team, especially Gibbs (Mark Harmon). By now, it is clear that Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo is in love with Cote De Pablo's character Agent Ziva David. And the departure of Cote from the show disappointed many, including myself. I just don't understand why the writers thought that the years of anticipation displayed by viewers should only be met with one kiss! One lousy kiss. They could've had something there. Gibbs, on the other hand, could've made it with characters such as LTC Hollis Mann or Jaime Lee Curtis's character Dr. Ryan. I don't understand why any potential long-term love interests don't make it on the show. At the end of the day, NCIS is one of my favorite shows to watch and it has been for many years. The writers are doing an amazing job along with the cast and guests of the show. I only hope to catch some development in terms of real relationships in the near future. *crossing my fingers for Abby and McGee*
