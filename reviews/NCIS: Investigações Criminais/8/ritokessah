Really great one, I remembered first seasons, live actions, live faces. fascinated views, unique scenario I didn't see anywhere else like colourful Halloween series, or thriller about radiation poisoned guy, or funny black-out series. As It may say, good old days..

Heroes are charismatic, very good choice, everyone is like not play but actually live their characters.

When you hear about navy you await to see ships, pirates, slavery traffic, treasure hunting, contrabandists, historic sails and romantic, sea and waves in common script. Hidden skeletons, secrets, lost people there out of beach. May be I do mistake with sea guard or how that it was, but it kinda still not expect instead a;; of this the bombs, terrorists, deal with world threats and all-world conspiracy. It's a little like fireman deals with I don't know emm gardening, or bomb squad goes remote cars. Not exactly what they should do, doesn't it.

And when scenario goes that way, do accent on lovable by Americans boom and bam covered in sea uniform for excuse, NCIS lost its charm, specialty became a little dull. It's not NCIS anymore, it is some kind of Special Unit, should rename by the way. And now goes new season. Let's see.
