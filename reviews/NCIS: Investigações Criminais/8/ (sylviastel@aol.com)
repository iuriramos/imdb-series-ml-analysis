The cast is headed by beloved Hollywood television star, Mark Harmon, who doesn't have an Emmy or A Golden Globe Award. Harmon richly deserves those accolades and more. He is one of the main reasons that NCIS has remained a beloved television series with high ratings for the last decade. The other cast members like Pauley Perrette, Michael Weatherly, and Sasha Alexander are team players. Scottish American actor, David McCallum, should also be honored with a British Honour for acting here. It's a shame that this show doesn't get the accolades and awards like other shows. The writing is consistent and strong. The cast is first rate. It's as entertaining and enlightening to watch. Still going strong after 13 seasons and the highest rated drama on television for years.
