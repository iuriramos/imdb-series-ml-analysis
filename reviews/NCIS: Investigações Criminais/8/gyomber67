Dear Mr. Harmon, 

as an Israeli citizen, I feel offending the picture about the Mosad as mindless, skilless, violent murderers. True, our Land is a hard one, hard decisions are made in hard situations - also because the Muslim mind considers mercy as fear and uses the judeo-Christian world-view as a weapon for instance by hiding behind their women and children or sending THEM to murder (many 8 year old kids are already skilled murderers). In spite of this Israeli soldiers and all defensive powers and institutions use peaceful, diplomatic or psychological solutions as long as they can. Although I haven't succeeded to settle down for longer than 10 years (thanks to the worldwide economical crisis), my heart is left there and I beg of you, use your influence to show a more realistic picture through Ziva David about my beloved ISRAEL. Thanks forward
