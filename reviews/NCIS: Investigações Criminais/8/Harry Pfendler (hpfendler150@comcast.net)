I am a great fan of NCIS and all the characters. Pauley Perette reminds me of Henry Winkler on Happy Days. His character started out rather non descriptive and turned into one of the major stars of the show thanks to the unselfish nature of Ron Howard. I suspect that Mark Harman has done the same for her character. I am concerned that the show may be becoming a kind of Soap Opera as so many long running shows became. It's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas each week. I really enjoy the light hearted comedy that is interjected into the series and I would not want to see it disappear. I might add that the character played by Rocky Caroll does not seem to add anything to the show. Perhaps it's time to promote him.
