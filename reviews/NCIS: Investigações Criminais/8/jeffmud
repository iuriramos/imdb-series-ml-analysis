I do not usually make comments on shows/movies but since so few people had commented on NCIS, I felt compelled to let people know that this is a pretty good show. It's not in the Great category, but each and every episode is very enjoyable, good writing, good acting and visually very pleasing. Mark Harmon is solid and his character has good interplay with the other main characters. Di Nozzo and Kate create some of the shows best moments. But like someone else has mentioned, I enjoy what Abby's character brings to the show. I have only watched the first season, but look forward to the next few seasons. I don't watch many shows on TV, I usually wait for the DVD's and watch a season from start to finish.

Two other extras the I like in the show are David McCallum who I have not seen since one of my favorite shows as a kid (Man from U.N.C.L.E) and I live near Pax River and this location was featured in a few shows, though I'm sure not shot at this location. One funny moment for me was the incorrect directions given to ST. Mary's State Park in one of the episodes.

I highly recommend this show !
