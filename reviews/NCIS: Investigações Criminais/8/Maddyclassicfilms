This TV series focuses on the investigation team of NCIS who investigate a number of things including murders, kidnappings and espionage cases involving naval personnel. 

The series stars Mark Harmon as the head of the team Agent Leroy Jethero Gibbs a tough former Marine, Gibbs is loyal to his friends and he would do anything for them.

The rest of the team consist of David McCallum as Dr Donald "Ducky" Mallard Gibbs best friend and the teams medical examiner who is both wise and a little eccentric,Michael Weatherly as Agent Tony Dinozzo Gibbs second in command who has a fantastic sense of humour and is huge film fan, Sasha Alexander as Agent Kate Todd formally a secret service agent assigned to the presidential protection detail, she may be new but she soon learns the ropes and what tragically happens to her in the episode Twilight leaves the team heartbroken. 

Sean Murray as Agent Timothy MGee Tony's apprentice who is only been an NCIS agent for a couple of years but soon becomes a valued member of the team,Cote DePablo as Mossad officer Ziva who replaces Kate she's a very strong character who has some very funny lines,Pauley Perrette as forensic officer Abby Sciuto a goth with a great sense of humour who is a vital team member and Lauren Holly as Director Jenny Shepard a former girlfriend of Gibbs. 

This is very good with interesting stories and characters and great action scenes. The series greatest strength though is the friendship between the characters and most of the series best scenes come from moments between them.
