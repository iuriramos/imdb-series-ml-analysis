I have watched NCIS from the very first episode and enjoyed some of the story lines very much. I do understand that it is all fiction! However, WHAT are the writers thinking? The last few years have followed the exact same pattern. During the season; We are supposed to believe that the team are so good they catch all baddies with very little effort but near the end of of the season we are supposed to believe they are so dumb that baddies manage to bug their phones, Abby's lab etc. AND then we find that they know exactly who the bad guy is but he/she gets away with multiple murders, robberies whatever, and when one of our heroes confronts them he/she manages to kill, maim or disarm all the minions but asks the biggest baddie to put their hands up, of course said baddie gets away to kill, maim etc for a few more episodes before our hero takes (usually) one shot, one punch, etc(FINALLY) and captures or kills the scumbag. NCIS LA and NCIS NO are exactly the same just different actors. Will have to find something else to watch!
