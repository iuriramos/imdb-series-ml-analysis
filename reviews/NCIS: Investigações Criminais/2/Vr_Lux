Okay I'll make it short : this show has good potential, could have been a major TV Success, but as it starts with the main theme, you immediately know what's up....some cheap synthetic piano track, with no mood and no spirit, that compared to this even Charlie Harper's jingles sound better...! PLUS, how the hell can you be as arrogant as the Gibbs character..?! I mean, who the hell does he think he is, some kinda God or something ? by hitting his employees behind the head and directing orders the way he does...The guy pisses off after 10minutes of watching, THIS IS NOT FUNNY ! I wouldn't even show this series to my kid, being afraid he'd have a wrong opinion of respect and human behavior...
