As a prior Marine, I know what NCIS actually does, and chasing terrorists through the streets of Washington DC is not it. If they were trying to make this a serious show, they failed horribly. I gave the show a chance because I was intrigued by the two part JAG episode in which it was introduced, but on it's own it fails to hold water. It basically became "how can we make JAG more like CSI?" Half the time they are investigating crimes that would be under FBI jurisdiction (notibly terrorism). The absolute worst part is the characters which are so stereotypical and one-dimensional:

You got your hard ass burnout-cop leader (Gibbs). Your chauvinistic frat boy (DiNozzo). Your sexy but-I'm-still-tough token female agent (Todd, now Ziva). Your lost-in-the-sauce FNG (McGee). Your techie nerd (Abby).

On the plus side, I have to admit I like Ducky. He's pretty cool. If only they could write his character off the show and move him to CSI.

Those like me who are familiar with the military will probably not like this show. Everyone else will (apparently) love it.
