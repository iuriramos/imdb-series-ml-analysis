DPB never planned to have a episodes that are hardly Navy and have a "cute" girl sitting on the floor. In all of his creations, he never had an actor or actress that sat on the floor to attract young viewers. Only wild GG did that and is destroying the original storyline of NCIS.

NCIS was to be about Navy/Marine Corp-incidents/crimes, just as JAG was. NCIS S1-2 did that beautifully with the team well gelled even with Kate Todd. Sasha Alexander left and they brought in wild cases but still Navy-centered. Then slowly the lost tract and made Ziva an NCIS agent. That was too extreme but the storyline still stayed. Even if CdP left suddenly, they still should have thought it thoroughly first before conjuring up a wild character. No, instead they made their new agent as one with no Federal Agent experience--Kate Todd was from the Secret Service and guarded POTUS, Ziva was from the Mossad and was Kidon. The new agent simply is an weakling who supposedly worked best on the floor. No Federal Agent or key character in any major TV series has never done that! It is not unique, it is not a selling point, it did not help improve the NCIS storyline!

Fast forward now. They realised their mistake but even if the crowd jewel Bishop is no longer on the floor or snacking, she creates no dramatic tension, no chemistry with team members or the whole team and is used to whine or gossip. Also, NCIS now is hardly about a Navy case--it is more "hey dead Navy/MC body, OK nex some weird storyline". That's it. The other characters--Tony, McGee and the rest have done less with "magical" Bishop around. Only Ducky remains constant.

Bottom line: DPB's creation is being destroyed. and Bishop is the worst of it.
