I'm reviewing NCIS after watching 12 seasons.

I don't know how I made it past 5 seasons actually. But sometimes there's nothing to watch. The show actually started out OK. But after Sasha Alexander was killed off it just became an avalanche of badly repeated recipes, mixed with some extremely clich√© characters.

The NCIS is not an anti-terrorist task force. Yet this is how the show portrays them. All the characters are the worst stereotype you can think of. Maybe not Ducky. He's the only one that is likable.

What frustrates me most is how CHEAP the show is. 90% of the victims are found in the same setting : either a park or somewhere near a wooden area. Then the rest of the show takes place in the cheapest FAKEST office building, with very obvious fake walls, fake windows, fake doors, fake lights. 

Save for the protagonists, no one seems to work in the office !! All they do is walk in the background, over and over again at the same pace for no reason at all. Not one bit is believable. Now the night scenes : the same stupid street is used for ALL the episodes. For a show that takes place in DC, they could have at least have SOME scenes in DC, right? Nope.

Conclusion : unrealistic, unbelievable writing, terrible corny jokes, unlikeable characters, can't believe they made 12 seasons of this
