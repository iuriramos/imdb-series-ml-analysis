I know I can't be the only person out there that sees through this show's god-awful cheesiness! For crying out loud every character is completely unoriginal cop cliché: an old bitter chauvinist leader, an asshat trigger-happy tough guy, a noobish rookie, a jaded female cop always trying to show that she's man enough for the job, and nerdy techie that knows everything, yet manages to remain 'cool' at the same time. Every episode begins with Gibbs saying "We've got a dead Marine!" and ends with the team stopping Al-Quada's latest plot to blow up Washington DC. 

If you can get around the obnoxious character and episode clichés then there is still the element of realism: real NCIS agents don't hunt terrorists in (US) city streets. At least 97% of the events that happens in this show are things they would never be involved in at all in real life.

But who am I kidding, mindless patriotic action shows are the hot thing these days, and people eat it up like hungry pigs.
