The first couple of seasons are great, with the chocking ending of season two finale "Twilight" as a specific high-point. Then the show stumbles a bit for a season or two, before it creates perhaps the best episodes and best entertainment you can find anywhere. But then it starts to slowly go downwards, and lately it is hardly watchable. 

There are two main faults with this show. Firstly it has gone on for too long. It is very apparent when you read the synopsis of each episode and you notice that 80% has basically been copy pasted. I mean, how many petty officer's and lieutenants can be murdered? Adding together the corpses from this show and there would hardly be anyone left to invade the next country U.S. want to destroy. Secondly the show is almost 100% propaganda, especially lately. The longer the show goes on, the more saluting the flag, all marines are heroes and U.S is always the good guy crap we see. There are plenty of episodes where I root for the "villains" because clearly they are in the right. 

The best part of the show are the characters. Great, amazing characters. Without them and great acting this show would have died a long time ago. 

At the end though, as a summation of all seasons, this is not a very good show. The last 3-4 season has been to fill up and make money. There are very few good stories left, and even the acting has gone down. Perhaps it is a 5 in total, but I subtract two additional points for the blatant and in-your-face propaganda which is just ridiculous. If you watch this and feel like a proud American or you want to join the military to go overseas to slaughter the innocent, then this show is for you, thinking people and adults should however stay away.
