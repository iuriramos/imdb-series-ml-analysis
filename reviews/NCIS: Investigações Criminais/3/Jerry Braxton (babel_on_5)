(cue The Cranberries song "Disappointment) The first episode I saw of NCIS was the one where the great (now late) Charles Durning played the Medal of Honor recipient, and I thought, "wow, this is really good." So my wife picked up the first 3 season on DVD at a garage sale (FIRST WARNING!) so I sat down to watch.

Wait a minute, I thought, this isn't NCIS, the thoughtful touching program I watched a few weeks ago. It was more like 90210 or "Welcome Back, Kotter" with the juvenile characters than a professional organization like SVU or CSI like I was used to watching. 

I'm not getting into details; this show is now 11 years old and well known. What I am amazed at is how people on the board go on and on about the same negative things that I picked up on as early as the first season and were glaring by the end of the third. I suppose they keep on with the series for the same reason you go on with a wife or husband you've been married to for 20 years: You remember when it was good and pray that somehow life (the show) will get back to that.

One thing more. I really wanted to like this show, really. I like cop shows, I like tight teams and good stories. IMO this is nothing more than a cop-based soap opera featuring the saga of Mossadu Barbie and Jethro Bodine... I mean Gibbs. I come back every now and again hoping it's better, but it's been a waste of my time. 6*** for the cast, 1* for everything else about it.
