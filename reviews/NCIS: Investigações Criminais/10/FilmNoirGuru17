It's a story. Well, like all other television shows. 

This is a phenomenal show that contains humor, romance, mystery and drama all mixed into the perfect combination. Personally, I did not care for Kate, and enjoyed watching her get killed every time the show is on. I believe Ziva (Cote de Pablo) is a better fit for the show, connecting with Gibbs (Mark Harmon) on a deeper, more emotional level. Tony (Michael Weatherly) is the primary subject to bring comic relief, often relishing it onto McGee (Sean Murray). 

Abby (Pauley Perrette) and Ducky (David McCallum) are excellent additions to the major cast, adding to the social diversity. 

It's an outstanding show from CBS and has a special place in my heart, having sentimentally attached to it. If you have not watched this series yet, it's definitely not too late.

I truly will be sad when the show pulls the curtains on its' final season.
