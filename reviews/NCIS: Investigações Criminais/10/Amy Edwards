In 13 years, NCIS has become a phenomenon. It has become and is still today the most watched TV show in the world in any genre. It has also attracted a lot of fans around the world including me and was the origin of two successful spin-offs in LA and New Orleans. But the original show remains the best of the three and my first favorite.

The stories are captivating and remarkably written. Throughout the 12 seasons I haven't felt bored watching an episode once. It is always related to the Navy and the Marines Corps but this doesn't exclude that the stories are diversified and bring us a lot of emotions. There are several episodes which are really gut-wrenching and should be considered as a model for scriptwriters all around the world.

But this is not only about the stories the show owns its success, it is first and foremost thanks to the amazing casting performance and the very high chemistry between the team members. It is more than a team we are watching doing their work, it is a family. The links between each of the members is so strong it is a pure enjoyment to see them teasing and interacting to each other. Here the team is the star. I have never seen anything like it in any other crime shows before. And I am welcoming it with open arms.

The other thing I love really much is that we can see the team outside of their jobs, enjoying time together or with their own families. In other shows we could see some part of the personal life of the characters but never to that extent. With NCIS it's almost like we are living with the team and they share no secrets to us. It is making them much more appreciated and more identifiable to our way of life. Some TV shows tried to imitate that philosophy but they never match the quality of how the stories are told.

It deserves nothing more than a 10 out of 10 and I wish to Gibbs and his amazing team of Very Special agents to delightfully entertaining us for many more years to come.
