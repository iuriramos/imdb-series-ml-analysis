This year hit the fans of Ncis , with the most awful news! well, that is if you are a fan of Michael Weatherly who plays Tony Denozzo in the series. Ncis,is by far the most brilliant show i have watched and it grew on to me , thanks to Michael Weatherly , with him quitting the show is like watching your favorite rose die or loose its petals!

i just can't imagine the show without his hysterical comments , his funny nicknames for McGee, his movie referrals ,his really bad eating habits or flirtatious habits oh and the smacks that were so felt by us fans. 

I just know NCIS will never be the same again , I am not really looking forward to it, will miss you , Very special agent Tony Denozzo ....sniff sniff
