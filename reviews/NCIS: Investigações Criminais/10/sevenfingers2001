I think Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) must like Jimmy Buffett since he's always building boats. Look it up on "License to Chill". I'm a "parrot head" and former sailor myself so I can understand. If the sea don't make you sick you're hooked for life. LOL I survived several tours in the Navy on a DDG. Wasn't always pretty. I never puked but I stood in some disgusting stuff while I used the head. Thank the Lord for high top paratrooper boots. Hurricane David in 1979 was my worst experience. I nearly blew chunks on that one. 2 days in a hurricane will do a number on you. So we only ate sandwiches because bread, saltine crackers, and Dramamine would let you survive that crap. Was it nasty? Hell yes! Our "sister" ship (DDG18) decided to sail into the eye of the hurricane. When we pulled back into Charleston, SC her main deck was stripped and they took more than a dozen injured into waiting ambulances. I wasn't even 19 but I remember it like it was yesterday. BTW I'm 55 now. My ship (DDG11) and I were conceived at roughly the same time. The poor old lady was retired long before me and has been recycled. I supposed I will be too in the near future. Thanks for a great TV show.
