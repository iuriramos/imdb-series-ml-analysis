Is Ziva really leaving the show? And why is she leaving? How are they gonna make it happen on the show? Who are they gonna use to replace her or are they gonna replace her at all? I think NCIS is the most awesome show on TV today. The characters are great funny and totally believable. The ladies on the show are very strong individuals and yet very sexy, especially Abbie. It has been about 10 years this show has been on TV and I'm willing to bet it can last another 10 years. I've been watching the reruns for as long as they've been showing them. I've watched all the episodes at least 15 times and I've prepared myself to watch them another twenty time as long as they keep showing them.
