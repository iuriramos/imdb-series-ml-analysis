I'm not sure if this will be a spoiler for those who have just started watching, but it was a great show and still is, but I personally preferred Special Agent Catherine "Kate" Todd instead of Ziva David. I know that it was Sasha Alexander's choice to leave the show, but Donald P. Bellisario could have not let her out of her contract early. It is a great show still, but I miss Kate and I got emotionally attached to the characters and when Kate died, I spent a couple of days crying and it really sucked. I still go back to the first two seasons just to see Kate and Tony together again because I personally think that they should have dated. (just my opinion) But this show is great and amazing, I just wished Kate was still alive.
