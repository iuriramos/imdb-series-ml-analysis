Hi,

i am probably NCIS's youngest fan, Really. my favorite characters must be Abby and McGee so far i am at series 8 episode 2, seeing as i watched my first NCIS episode 2 years ago and i also watch many other shows such as Rookie Bllue and CSI and Castle! Abby: Abby is totally me and well i love her style and the music she listens to. Abby and Mcgee are totally right for each other though they don't seem to go out after series 1! which is a total shame and i hope they get together, please tell me if they have in episodes i have not seen yet :D Mcgee: i Think that he does great (Seeing as he is like 34 or something) and is like the youngest so he is so mature :D
