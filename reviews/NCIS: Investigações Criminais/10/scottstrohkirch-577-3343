This show is still the best show going in it's ninth season. I must admit that when they took Caitlin Todd off the show after season 2, I was afraid that the show wouldn't be the same. Enter Cote de Pablo as Ziva David. It's interesting to watch a South American play an Israeli. She is sexy and intimidating when she has to be. Her mistakes with American colloquialisms is just the right amount of humor to break the tension.

McGee's growth over the years has also been refreshing and Abby is always fun to watch. I would like to see more episodes with Gibbs Dad as well as DiNozzo's Dad. We met McGee's sister, but what of his parents? This show needs to continue for many more years. I love watching repeats of this show on USA and I can't say that about any of the CSI shows.
