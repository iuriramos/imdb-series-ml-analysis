I really really love NCIS, but there's a few things that bother me, is this TIVA situation, it's been a long time since the producers begun the teasing between Tony and Ziva. You people either get it on, or get it off, because a lot of people is getting tired of this, no one in real life flirt with other people so long. This year some actors of the show teased with: "this is the year of TIVA" there's 5 episodes left and we haven't seen a lot of action or chemistry between them. Also the daddy-doesn't-like-me episodes are getting boring and boring by the time and my last issue would be Abby, I love her, but she is getting to old for the goth-look, she needs a make-over asap. Finally I just read they were renewed for season 11, lets hope its gets better and better by the time, because this is one of a few shows I do not want to see and end to it.
