This show is the best ever! The cast is amazing and so is the storyline and characters! Perfectly written!!! I have to admit that I am completely obsessed with this show. I love every factor of the show. Every actor and actress is amazing...especially Lauren Holly. The writers do an amazing job! So does the crew and actors! There is no better show out there in my opinion. It's just awesome! I love the interaction between the characters. The relationship between Jenny and Gibbs was amazing! Tony and Ziva's interaction were great! I do miss Ziva and Cote so much, but Ellie and Emily are wonderful! I love watching the show! It is my favorite! I just love everything about NCIS the show!
