When Leroy Jethro Gibbs was introduced during "JAG" he turned in a performance very different from the frothy "Summer School" of decades ago. Mark Harmon has matured most gracefully, and plays the curmudgeon to the hilt - but not over it! The age-related zingers resonate with this particular baby boomer and I enjoy all of them.

Michael Weatherly gets to play against his previous casting as "Eyes Only" from the late, lamented "Dark Angel" series, showing us a broadening range of acting skills.

The addition of David McCallum as the coroner is spot-on, and Paulie Perrette's Abby is most refreshing.

The addition of Agent Lee with the penchant for hijacking morgue attendant Palmer also makes for unexpected levity.

The stories keep me enthralled as I can never figure out whodunit, nor whydunit.
