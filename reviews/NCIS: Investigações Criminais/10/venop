This series is one of the best that EVER appeared on TV. Considering how much TV we are watching nowadays, this looks exaggerated, but it is not. The cases (the scripts) originate from the life of the US Navy. They are original, even bizarre sometimes, but it looks that we live with that kind of people.

Second, the acting is very good, and the characters are almost real life people, so sometimes you have to remind yourself that you are watching TV. The actors are not very famous, but they all do an excellent job.

Mark Harmon's character is excellent and I would be very sorry to see him leave the show (S3, 3x23 and 3x24, Hiatus part 1 &2), but let's hope that it is because of the suspense of the cliff-hanger, just trying to keep spectators anxious for the next (fourth) season, which I sincerely hope will be forthcoming.

He is the strongest link, the one who does not talk much, honest to the bone, but deeply compassionate. He takes care of everybody and holds them together (not only his team, but the families of the victims, and sometimes even the criminals). The others follow and, when you have a good leader, everything is possible. You have to see it to believe it. 

I could write for hours, but watching any episode will do the trick and replace pages of writing. 

I also recommend The Hill Street Blues (1980's series) which introduced this kind of approach to the police work, but on a slightly different level. 

There is magic on TV (Star Trek-TNG quality if you like), and it can be seen in NCIS.
