I absolutely LOVE this show, since my friend Stacey got me onto it. My favourite character is Abby. I have seen the second half of seasons 2 and 3, they are currently playing on TV here. I recently got the season 1 DVDs, they only recently came out here, and I have been watching them heaps! NCIS is the best part of my Wednesday nights (shows on Wednesday in Aus.) and it would not be the same without the show. I always laugh at the quotes I hear from others, especially my friend Stacey, who has several pages of NCIS quotes. I think that NCIS is different to other crime shows, eg. CSI, because of the increased focus on the lives of the characters, not just the crimes that they investigate, which makes it better in some regards. Overall, NCIS completes my week, and I hope it continues to be shown on TV for awhile, but when it stops, there will always be the DVD's!
