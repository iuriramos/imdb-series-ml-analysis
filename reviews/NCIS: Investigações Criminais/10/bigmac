Tony would be pleased it takes two people to replace him! Loving the new special agents. And what a delight to have Jennifer Esposito back on prime time! Welcome back Jennifer. You were missed. Wilmer Valderrama's character of Nick Torres is interesting. It will certainly be exciting to see him interact with the veteran cast. Long way from Fez. I am glad the new season finally arrived.

I believe David McCallum once said, "as long as there is life in David, there will be life in Duckie". As long as there is an NCIS, I will watch.

Welcome back guys!
