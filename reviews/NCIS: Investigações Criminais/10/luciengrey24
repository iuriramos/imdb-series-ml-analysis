NCIS is the best show on the planet. And this is coming from someone that watches a lot of TV . Since probably the A Team, i don't think there has been a how , where every single character is a delight to watch. Without a doubt i have to say that NCIS is among my top five favourite shows. I must admit channels surfing and seeing the shows title on the Hallmark channel i really wasn't interested in anything that it had to offer. But by chance i did sit down one day to watch the show and i was completely blown away.Forget CSI, it may be a more popular show , but by far i prefer NCIS. The banter between Di'nozzo and Kate is what i love the most, their hate/beef relationship and the way Tony is a guys guy, humorous in every way, and i can't imagine the show without his character. And the gorgeous Kate played by Sasha Alexander, i just love their relationship. Then when it comes to comes to Gibbs, he's not one dimensional like Haratio, and i just love the Father/Child relationship he has with Tony and Kate. The supporting characters of Abi,Doc and McGee are lovely too.I haven't seen David Macullum since he played Kuriyakan in The Man from U.N.C.L.E, which i absolutely loved. A definite 10 , i would watch NCIS over any other detective/Investigation show. A must watch.
