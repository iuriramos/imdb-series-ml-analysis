Navy Criminal Investigative Service is one of the best TV shows in the world at the moment because of its unique characteristics. The show has a wonderful cast where each character has his/her own unique style. The idea of a "my rules", by Gibbs puts the audience is a "high", because of the Rules/Laws he breaks. There is a major difference between NCIS and other Criminal Investigative shows, the producer has included comedy within the storyline which breaks the tension between the "seriousness" thus attracting a larger audience. The director comes up with unique ideas for each episode, making every episode enjoyable. Even if you have seen the episode previously you would still want to see it again just for those "special", funny themes that gives everyone a laugh. Most importantly this show can be viewed by a much larger age bracket because it contains more story, comedy etc rather than Gore or violence.
