What makes this programme excellent is that it allows us to watch people who are good at what they do. We enjoy the company of characters who are good at what they do; actors who are good at bringing those characters to life; writers, directors, casting producers, editors, music supervisors who are all good at what they do.

Television -- both drama and comedy-- is always better when it is built on, around , by and about people who are good at what they do. 

These same observations were true about the programme "JAG", which was consistently excellent for the same reasons. Let us hope that more programming will be based on this simple principle: let us watch the work of people who are good at what they do.
