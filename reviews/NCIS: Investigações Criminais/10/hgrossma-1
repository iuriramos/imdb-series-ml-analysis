Sirs: 

I recently discovered, from an article in "USA Weekend," that Cote de Pablo is a trained singer who studied musical theater at Carnegie Mellon University. In her own words, "My dream was to be an opera singer. I didn't get there." It would be wonderful if an episode were to be created (perhaps one concerning the murder of a serviceman music lover that takes place during an opera performance) that would require the exquisite Cote de Pablo to use her cunning to help solve the crime by exhibiting her recently discovered (by me, at least) beautiful operatic singing voice.

What a double treat for the listening audience!
