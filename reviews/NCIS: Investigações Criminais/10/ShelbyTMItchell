The show has it all! Romance, drama, action, humor, you name it. It has been on since 2003! And it is the #1 drama, surpassing CSI on the CBS network, that also airs both dramas.

Mark Harmon is cast as the lead, LeRoy Jethro Gibbs. As he is a old school hero in the form of John Wayne. And that he cares about his team, despite not showing emotions. He is cool, calm, level-headed but sympathetic at the same time. And doesn't want his team either hurt. But not to mess up on their cases.

The supporting cast is just as good. As Michael Weatherly as the wisecracking Tony DiNizzo, Cote De Pablo as no-nonsense Ziva David the ex-Mossad agent, Sean Murray as Tim "Probie" McGee, the tech expert. And David McCallum(The Man from UNCLE) as the wise, witty Ducky, the team's medical examiner. 

But the one that steals the show is Pauley Perrette as comic relief, tech lab person Abby Schutto. As she steals the show from everybody with her wit, charm, and shows that she does care about Gibbs team. 

The show you just couldn't ask for more in this. With it all it has to offer. See the show yourself, in order to know what I mean.
