After 11 years of NCIS and now going into the 12th why does everybody on the team who gives Gibbs a report or information need to "waffle on" about how they got the information? You would think by now they would just give Gibbs the information instead of being head slapped or have Gibbs yell at them.

My second peeve is the unrealistic use of "Coffee Cups" or "Caf-Pow". The way the actors handle the cups it's obviously the cups are empty. As you can tell by sound they make hitting a surface and the way they "drink" from them. They should put water in them as this would make it more realistic.
