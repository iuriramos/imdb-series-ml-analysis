This is one of the best shows I've ever seen. It does have its up and downs but overall it's an amazing show. I love the characters and the story lines, this show really keeps me going when I feel down.

I would definitely like Michael Weatherly to return it really isn't the same without him but it's still a good show without him. The actors really do work well with each other, the characters are very different from the normal set of procedural characters that gives NCIS some of it quirks.

I've watched this show from start to finish too many times to count and it really doesn't get old.
