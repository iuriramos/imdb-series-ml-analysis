Hi to all:

YES! Gibbs, Aka Mark Harmon was a cute guy! Now, he is a gorgeous MAN! He is sexy, and I love this show!

QUESTION: On one of the first episodes of fall 2006, there is a scene where Tony Dinozzo goes..."Chick Fight" and later, he and "Probie" pull off their shirts! My Direct TV was not acting correctly, and I did not get to tape this. Can anyone tell me what the name of that episode is? I LOVE THIS SHOW! 

My son-in-law was in the Marines, and he was the one that told me about this great show! I really love Ziva. My husband is Jewish, and she is great in the character she plays, although I have to admit, I hated that Kate got killed a couple of seasons ago. Ducky is funny, and when his mother is on the show, it is even funnier!

This is the PERFECT CAST!!! Please e-mail me w/the episode:)! Osslady2333@aol.com
