I really like this show! Great characters, good stories, humor. What more can you ask for? I liked Kate better than Ziva but Ziva is OK.

McGee is a bit too nerdy. The character is OK but sometimes I wonder how he got the job in the first place. Tony can be annoying but there's warmth and humor in his way of being. Abby and Ducky are great characters overall. Gibbs is definitely a good team leader. Sometimes he acts like a jerk against his people but it seems to be part of the interaction between the team members and I don't think anyone of the others feel insulted because Gibbs actually cares about his people.

I find NCIS very exciting and very entertaining and can hardly wait for the next episode!
