I simply can't resist watching this series.I would watch it non-stop,over and over and i would NEVER get bored or love it less.The characters:Gibbs,DiNozzo,Abby,Ziva,McGee,Ducky...every single one of them will captivate you,make you smile,laugh and cry while trying to find criminals and solve the mystery of how an innocent person was murdered.I don't want to write too much about NCIS TV series because in order to love it and to understand just how great it can be,you have to watch it for yourself...but i have to warn you that,once you start watching it,you will have a hard time stopping to do your daily chores...i bet you will simply love it.It's by far my favorite TV series and if it would be discontinued,my heart will sure be broken.
