One of the best series I have seen in recent years. One of my Spanish friend recommended it to watch, and as I started I got to know why. I spent like 80% of the time reading the Spanish translations. Lol. But, boy oh boy, what a series, I got hooked onto it so much that, I finished 1st season in 2 days, and I must accept I am dumb enough to do that cus next season is not airing so soon...I never knew anything about Columbia, just that they speak Spanish and have most beautiful women in the world. Pablo Escobar was the 10th richest man in the world at the peak of his career with estimated assets of about 30billion dollars, making him the richest criminal in the history. Muchas gracias Netflix for such as awesome series, appreciate it.
