BRAVO! Wagner Moura, what a brilliant performance, the subtle facial expressions and dark undertone played perfectly with the raw visuals and sound. I loved how Escobar could look so calm while leaving you unnerved, at times you were wondering will he congratulate you or kill you.

The small details were what made it special, how he reacted to disrespectful body language and really created a character you could understand and be confused over at the same time, can a man be this evil? Great directing, they kept it authentic with the subtitles and it was a pleasure to watch, cannot wait for season 2.
