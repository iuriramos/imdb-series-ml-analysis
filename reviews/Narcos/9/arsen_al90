A very consistent, non-exploitative look at the world of drug smuggling. All the actors contribute equally to the overall narrative, with none standing out to the detriment of the production as a whole. That said, Pedro Pascal (Oberyn in Game of Thrones) is very effective as the bulldog cop. 

Narcos is a prime example of new media's ability to generate content that is not beholden to the advertising driven content creation of yesteryear. While employing many mundane story telling devices such as voice-over and smash cuts for dramatic effect, it also offers the viewer a rare cultural emersion through lenses focused on the lush jungles that surround Medellin and the cityscapes of Bogota and more importantly, the shows bilingual dialogue. Often times, having to read subtitles reminds this viewer that she is watching something foreign and thereby limits the willing suspension of disbelief, however, the easy back and forth between Spanish and English in "Narcos" allows for a viewing experience that doesn't let cultural disparity get in the way.

All in all, it is one of the best shows out there!
