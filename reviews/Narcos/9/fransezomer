Now, this is a truly great series. I love almost everything about it. The simplicity of the real story of a very, very bad man, Pablo Escobar, mixed with the complexity of the situation in Colombia in the Eightees and Ninetees are masterfully filmed. The series is fast- paced, script is strong, dialogue is real life, characters are totally authentic. I have lived in Brazil for a number of years and was already very familiar with the work of Brazilian actor Wagner Moura (Escobar). He was great in 'Tropa de Elite', but this is his best work to date. Not only does he resemble Pablo (after gaining a lot of weight), but his acting with as few words as possible make him totally genuine in portraying Escobar. But... I am no native Spanish speaker, and from what I read in other reviews on IMDb, apparently his Spanish accent is disturbingly bad. So bad that most native Spanish speaking cannot even watch the series. I personally love Moura's Spanish accent, but again I'm not a native Spanish speaker.

What really disturbs ME a lot is actor Boyd Holbrook who plays the role of a DEA agent, and is one of the main characters of the show. His acting is so bad that I should deduct a full point from the series total. He looks like an adult Macauley Culkin from Home Alone, and has absolutely no place in this series. His appearance is flat, no depth... fake, he could be on Youtube and still suck. An absolute blunder from the casting department for this series.

Still, I love this series and I am happy that Narcos series 3 and 4 were announced yesterday.
