This is an intriguing and entertaining adaptation of a true story, yes it is not 100% factually correct but it does follow the story of Pablo Escobar very closely. I loved the use of 'old school' real footage to Emphasize the fact that this is a real story rather than a thought up money spinner. 

The person who cast the two main characters in this series deserves to win an academy award as you could be forgiven for thinking that this was more of a documentary rather than an entertainment show.

Overall a fantastic piece of screen play, somewhat adapted to make it more 'enjoyable' and I for one cannot wait for season 3.
