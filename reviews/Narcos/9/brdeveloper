I see a lot of people posting reviews based on the first three episodes, which don't do justice to the production's quality. The first three episodes look a bit like Padilha's Robocop remake, posing a geopolitical context which can feel slow or "documentary-esque". The next episodes produce that addictive effect that occurs in the good TV shows. 

Agent Murphy (Boyd Holbrook) resembles a lot Capt. Nascimento (Wagner Moura) from Elite Squad I & II: he's completely taken by his job, and sometimes he's not so fond to the human rights agenda. The spectator tend to forgive the latter aspect due to the atrocious way drug traffickers treat their opponents, but sometimes we stay confused about who are the good guys here. Anyway, it's good seeing a TV show which avoid a Manichean point of view.

The season ends leaving room for another one season, or perhaps even a third one, functioning like Elite Squad II, which was a sequel, but with an entirely different approach, deepening the political axis of the drug traffic business.
