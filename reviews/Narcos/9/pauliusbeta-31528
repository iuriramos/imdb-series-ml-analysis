Serial is quite interesting, but I think there are much mistakes. Many characters shown like stupid idiots, but if they were so stupid how they could build cocaine empire with billions profit? And I found one big mistake of director work, was interesting to see Pablo paramour journalist, that was going to Pablo with BMW 5 series of 1996 year (Pablo died at 1993m). 8 part 43min 28s. But speaking about serial generally, it makes viewer to think about this black business and results of trying to control every one by fear and money help. You could control many people, but not all. In all times will be honest and brave men and women. I would like to wish good time of watching this serial.
