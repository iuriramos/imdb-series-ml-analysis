Brilliant series of life of Pablo Escobar and the upcoming cocaine trafficking in the 70s and 80s from South America and the US.

I've just seen the first episode and already eager to watch the rest of season 1! Well acted, well filmed with all the characters speaking their own language (so no English speaking South American drug lord!). The series takes you to the beginning of the cocaine business and how it became one of the US contemporary biggest problems, seen through different settings, from the jungle with the coca plants, the villa's in Colombia, the traffic to the US and the dealers and DEA in Miami, all in relation with Escobar's life.

So not only nice to watch because of the action and suspense like any drug trafficking action movie (Miami Vice!) also historical very interesting.
