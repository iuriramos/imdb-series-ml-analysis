Surprised this TV series hadn't been done sooner, but this show makes it well worth the wait. Wagner Moura is outstanding, and deserves a couple of awards for his performance. Compelling, enigmatic and quietly brutal.

I found this both entertaining as well as fascinating, exploring the nuances of the past, seeing what these characters were up against. Netflix have created something quite special here. Thank you!

I'd give it a 10, but because I have to wait for season 2 (God I hope there is one!) it only gets a 9. Watch this and enjoy a great production, you wont be sorry!
