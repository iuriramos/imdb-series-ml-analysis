Netflix has yet another fantastic show with Narcos.Overall the cast play their roles amazingly and the subject matter is as entertaining as it is dark. The story of Pablo Escobar is told well and the depiction of Columbia and Pablo feel very authentic. My minor complaint would be that Wagner Moura's Spanish accent stands out a little against some of his fellow actors, its not a big problem and probably only really noticeable if your'e fluent in Spanish. Everything else about the show is done very well and the production value is great! Narcos is a fantastic mafia/cop show that adds even more value to your Netflix subscription. I hope that shows of this quality will continue to be a trend on Netflix.
