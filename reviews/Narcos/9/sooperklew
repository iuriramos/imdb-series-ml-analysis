I think a lot of people will compare this to Breaking Bad which is not really fair. Breaking Bad was the best TV show of all time perhaps. I enjoyed the show from the first but i wasn't sure if it was great or merely good until the season 1 finale. That episode elevated the show in my mind from good to great.

It may be that i didn't realize it was the finale so i didn't watch it with elevated expectations. So i'd recommend the show unabashedly and also recommend not noticing how many episodes there are if possible :)

As you'd expect in a series based on a true story the actions and attitudes of the characters are a lot more realistic and true to reality rather than what someone thinks people would/should act like. 

Solid 9/10.
