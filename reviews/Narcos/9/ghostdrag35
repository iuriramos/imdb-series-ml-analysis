great acting.. great story line.. very educational.. never a dull moment. action sequences were well done. really couldn't stop watching this show... very addictive. my only hangup was that most of the time.. you have to pay attention to subtitles instead of whats going on.. and sometimes i couldn't read fast enough. however it did add to its authenticity. pedro pascal once again holds his own as he did previously on game of thrones. the addition of the actual footage of what transpired back then was a nice touch.. as well as the narration. all and all one of the finer quality programs of 2015.. further solidifying Netflix as a powerhouse of original content.
