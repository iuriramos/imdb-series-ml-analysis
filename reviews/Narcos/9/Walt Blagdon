Have only watched the first couple episodes and I am hooked! It reminds me very much of the movie Blow. If you enjoyed that movie then you will love this show.

The only reason I never gave it a 10 is because of the subtitles for the non English speaking parts. I would normally stop watching any show or movie that requires that much reading. It feels like at least half of the show is in Spanish. But the show is so good for the first time I am willing to read instead of just listen.

I plan on binge watching the rest of the episodes over the next few days.If you enjoy shows that involve true stories with crime and drugs then this is the show for you. As long as you don't mind some reading.

Edit....after finishing all 10 episodes I take back what I said about the subtitles. It is much easier to read subtitles than to try and understand and actor with an accent. In some of the scenes where a guy with a Spanish accent spoke English I found it hard to understand and would then actually missed the subtitles.
