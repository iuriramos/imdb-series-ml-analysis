Narcos is a show on Netflix that is a biographical drama about the rise and fall of the most notorious drug lord in all of Colombia, Pablo Escobar. Narrated by DEA agent Steve Murphy, this show has a little bit of everything in it but mostly the major things that makes a show a masterpiece , Violence,Drugs,Sex,and more Violence. This show is almost 93% Spanish, so if you are native or know this language, you don't have to use and read the subtitles. If not, you have to read the subtitles to understand what is said by the people in Colombia. This series is about 8 and a half hours long but it is very entertaining to watch. However, this series is VERY VIOLENT and can be very hard to watch with the thought that anything can happen in any time, let alone place. The sex and nudity is in between mild and extreme because the second episode has about 5 sexual scenes {not a spoiler but a warning}. The language and profanity is Extreme which is both in Spanish and English but the violence is most detailed. OVERALL-SHOW-17+ OR ABOVE
