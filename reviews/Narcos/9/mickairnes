Really enjoyed the first two seasons. Mainly due to the performance given by Wagner Moura. Due to the first season going pretty much the full way into the Escobar story, ending with escape from La Catedral, season 2 was always going to end with the death of the kingpin. Although the 10 episodes were filled with action, heartbreak and triumph. The scene I enjoyed the most was in the final episode when Pablo has a conversation with his dead cousin Gustavo on a park bench. In that scene we are made to be sympathetic towards Pablo, seeing him at his most weakest. The ending of the season sets the series up for further seasons focused on the Cali Cartel after Pablo's demise. Here's hoping the series get renewed and we get to see further Narcos madness.
