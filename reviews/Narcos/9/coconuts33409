The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of the 10 is 1. The crappy looking Florida license plates in episodes 1 & 2 look like they were made on a copy machine (Florida also did not have front license plates in the 80's). And 2. They could have done without the extreme sexual content severely limiting their audience especially since nowadays extreme violence is more tolerable than extreme sexual situations. Other than those two hiccups, this series is superbly shot, directed; the acting is phenomenal; the filming locations are spot on, the dialects are incredibly accurate. I don't know who this producer is, but they have done a perfect job with the story line, characters, and actors. This series is deserving of any and all filming/acting awards known to man.
