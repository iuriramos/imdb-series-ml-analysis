Fascinating, thrilling and powerful in all aspects. Brilliant acting performance by Wagner Moura playing Pablo Escobar. Boyd Holbrook as Steve Murphy is in a role of his life time. The background voice of Murphy, the scenic Columbia and the busy urban life makes it visually aesthetic as well. It is the best on Netflix at the moment. Netflix has once again lived up to to the expectation by bringing a show which is next to reality. Another good thing about "NARCOS" is the the fast pace it has to keep the audience engaged. Film lovers who like gangster movies will find this new series gripping. Folks looking out for some action paced crime drama should definitely hang on to this one. First episode will grab your attention to the level that you would want to see all ten episodes at once. Finally we got some gangster stuff to look at in classic settings.
