Wagner Moura , played Escopar as natural as water and wine, wonderful, emotional, adrenaline flowing , amazing , I love it, if you like great directing , then this is your show, you will be on fire, and eat the whole food in your refrigerator, and all pizza slices, watch it alone , because you will hear your heart beating , absolutely great, go for itÂ… it's your show
