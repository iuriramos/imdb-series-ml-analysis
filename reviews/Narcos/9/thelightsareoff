Stunning performances, chilling reality. An new benchmark in television. Netflix, you scored. Wagner's acting sets new standards. I watched all 10 episodes in a 2-day marathon, this is television at its best. You don't know if you hate or love Escobar, the series puts you on a different side at any moment. After episode 3 you are hooked. A few inconsistencies to notice; a late model BMW of a different era, lightweight body-armor. But that is detail to a series where character building in historic context is done at its best. Superp co-acting. If you thought Narco is bad, reset. It is VERY bad and you will see. A great way to quickly get the history of Colombia and its struggle in the last 30 years.
