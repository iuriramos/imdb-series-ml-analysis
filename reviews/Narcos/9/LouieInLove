NB. This should be the benchmark of all TV shows, sadly it is not. Well done to those involved. The people involved with this show deserve to be in the entertainment industry.

It's as though they took the concept of History channel reenactment-documentaries to a whole new level. Mixing narration with real footage & photographs to accompany the story. It works ever so well. This show (unlike so many) does not patronise the viewer.

*A really important point to make about Narcos is that the majority of the show is actual in Spanish. Now! Here's an example of how good the show is: I am not a Spanish speaking person, however, I didn't actually notice that the majority of the show is in Spanish until the 3rd episode. Bravo! 

Seeing a show like this makes me happy because it is what every show should be; creative, accessible, engaging & just good! I get so frustrated at the amount of 3rd rate shows (storytelling) which are primarily a product of nepotism, interference or simple lack of talent.

They had a great story to start off with & they didn't f**k it up.
