Netflix Series Narcos has got all the attention with only 10 episodes of its first season.The reality exposing Series host Netflix has a progress and potential of being one of the most serious components of "HBO". The comparison of Netflix and HBO flashed in my mind after I have been observing the same path of the sociological and bare humanly truths occurs in its series, ever since most of them inspired and depicted from biographies, in the first hand without hesitation, as well as the "HBO" series. "Narcos" is one of the example of these kind of series that has the possibility of becoming a classic, including one of the most popular Colombian crime boss's real life story, who is well known by the rest of world as well.

The crime movies, TV-series and mini-series has always fulfilled their genre expectations from the audience ever since they are the audience's most popular genre from the beginning.And the fictional mainstream ones always contains pure violence with the calm investigation scenes. Therefore, I usually call this crime Genre as Immortal and fresh living that never loses its popularity. Nevertheless, Narcos is not all fictional.The most of its plot bases on a true story. And maybe has the real story scenes which were and will be the inspirer of the other crime- action filming for years. That makes the series winner even in the first season. I think, it won't be necessary to make huge dramatic additions in all other seasons, in a result of Pablo Escobar's life with its unique plot, even beyond most of the imaginative action movie scripts.

The political criticism of both the U.S.A and Colombia even increases the taste with it's judgemental seasoning, furthermore the violent crime kingpin's utopic life. Pablo Escobar ruled Colombia for a while. He wasn't a president, moreover he couldn't manage to enter the parliament. However, he gained an unbelievable power with the condoning acts of the politicians and the phallic war of internal affairs of Colombia and the suspicious helper U.S.A. The depiction of the acute and ambitious Escobar, gaining the power of a country with finding the gaps of it and taking its beneficial potency, with his own violent army that can easily kill even the president of Colombia, and most important his supplements to the public with cocaine money, that make their self- sacrificing commitment to Escobar.

One clever criminal with lots of lies and the capacity of manipulating, tortured a big country, and seduced the biggest in the world with actual (in Colombia) and indirect (in the U.S.A with usage of cocaine) massacre with his fearless ambition. He did it with all his exposed rich life, with teasing Colombian and The U.S.A government both while they were working together. He exploited the U.S.A commanders' war against the bunch of communist with no harm, he used the breed bad blood trump to tie the CIA's hands and weaken the Colombian government also. And for what?

Just maintain the Utopic peaceful Colombia?Nah as you continue watching this season and possibly the next seasons you will realise the egoism of a man that never leaves the ambition of gaining bloody money and sociopathic attitudes of a criminal who doesn't care if no one stay alive except his family members. In the first season, we have all seen these mess in the perspective and narration of a DEA agent Steve Murphy. The depiction of small conflicts that caused big deaths began with the both countries' Governments criticism. And I am eagerly waiting to see more insider stories of the dark era of Colombia and the darks sides of Pablo Escobar even I know the story in the surface. I recommend the series as "Narcos" is a real and undiplomatic Crime story.
