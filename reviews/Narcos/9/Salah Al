Let's be clear here, I'm not reviewing the TV show according to its accuracy in depicting El Pablo's true story. I'm only reviewing according to how I felt watching the show.

For a while, I have been figuring out my taste in TV and film in general. I reached a relizatyion that I'm into hood-gangs and drug-related stories. However, I'm not always in the mood to watch this type of shows, but Narcos? Narcos will grow on you whether you're in the mood or not. The show has a brilliant flow that you can't feel bored (at all!) watching the whole season in one sitting. And if you've watched as many shows as I did, then you know how rare that case is! Without spoiling anything, the show makes you understand how money can give you power and, literally, buys you anything! This show is the master of all genres, with perfecting action, drama, psychology, thrill, mystery and gore categories in one damn season!
