In a way this is a spiritual successor to true detective season 1. Just like that one, this is an anthology detective story.

Set in Colombia and around, this is the inception of cocaine from obscurity to prime time. Jose Padhila does a fantastic job putting it all together just like Cary Fukunaga did on true detective season 1.

The production value is through the roof, Netflix is really going big on this one. This is probably in their top 3 best series produced.

WelI, I am only 3 episodes inn. I'll finish this after I've gone through the season.

Highly recommended.
