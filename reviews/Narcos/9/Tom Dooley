This was made for Netflix  where I watched it  and is based on the life of Pablo Escobar. I have read and seen a fair bit about the man and this follows the facts as portrayed in the Colombian documentary 'Los Tiempos de Pablo Escobar' and to say what happens is stranger than fiction is a massive understatement. It takes us along for the ride with Escobar and his cronies starting to realise that Colombia was a failing state and money talks. In his case it screamed and the US soon realised what was happening on its doorstep  only they were a bit late to the party.

By the time they caught up with him he had becomes numero uno in the drugs World. His power and influence gave him plenty of ideas too and they are all depicted here. It is a fair depiction of him as a man  presenting him as human and incredibly ruthless, cynical and downright nasty.

The production values are extremely high and the acting is just superb. Escobar is played by the excellent Wagner Moura who is actually Brazilian but speaks Spanish here like a native. He has been in so many brilliant films including 'Elite Squad' where he was seriously fit so must have attacked the pasta to gain the weight needed for this role. He is ably supported by a cast where even the bit players are outstanding. We have the stories of the brave men and women who went after him too and to say this makes for excellent TV is like saying cocaine can be a tiny bit addictive, and just like 'Charlie' this too had me hooked after one hit  I shall stop gushing now, but also I have not met a single person who did not rave about this and there are plans for a second season which I hope is very soon indeed.
