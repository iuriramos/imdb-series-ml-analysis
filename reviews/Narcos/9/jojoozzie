Outstanding. But why the subtitles? I hate them. As I'm reading the subtitles, I'm taking my eyes off the action. I hate subtitles so much, I never watch a movie that has them. This series was the exception, it was so good, I put up with them. I would have given a 10 rating, but did I mention I HATE SUBTITLES!!!!!! OK, I have just been rejected because my review was not long enough. So I guess I will just have to put up with this rule because I really want to submit my review. OK, now I'm going to resubmit to see if it's long enough. Well, I just got rejected again. I'm being told that my review is still too short. I will use this opportunity to express my opinion that this is really a stupid rule. I'll now try again.
