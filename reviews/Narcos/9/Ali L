I just binged watched the first season of "Narcos" in two days, and I can't wait for Season 2....Does anyone know if there will be a second season?....I'm crossing my fingers....I wanted to review it because I thought it was great and I hope that by "word of mouth" it will get more viewers. It deserves it. Everything that has been said positively about it, I agree with: storyline, direction, acting, screenplay, scenography, editing, and the production are top notch. My only slight disappointment was the "non-Spanish" accent I detected on the actor that plays Escobar from the get go, and my Google search told me that he's Brazilian, which made sense. The question of "why didn't they find/couldn't they find" a Colombian actor for this part crossed my mind. HOWEVER, Mr. Moura does have the "paisa" sing-song way of speaking down to a "T", and his acting is very good, which made it easy for me to involuntarily forget about that detail. Besides, the rest of the main and supporting cast is so good and they bring together such a good balance, that it made the story and the relationships between all the characters flow very smoothly. My main dislike was Mr. Luis Guzman's characterization of Gacha because I feel that the actor, who is of Puerto Rican ascent in real life, could not give his character a more South American flavor. I think Mr. Guzman was a miscast 100%. Also, I found highly interesting that so much real footage from different events that occurred during that time was added. Overall, I was extremely impressed with the production level. Fantastic job, Netflix! BTW - for those reviewers that had a real problem with Mr. Moura's non-Colombian accent, I suggest you listen again, or for the first time, Al Pacino's accent on "Scarface". Just awful and ridiculous. Mr. Moura's "not real" Colombian accent is not even a 1/8 of that "not real" Cuban train wreck, and that was Al "Oscar Winner" Pacino.
