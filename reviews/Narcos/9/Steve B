This is really just the best in high end television. Netflix has a fantastic series with Narcos.

You get a real feel from the inside for who Pablo Escobar was. I think they skim over the violence quite a bit even though they show a lot. The US side of things is not shown too much.

I really came to an understanding of who he was, though I thought I knew a lot. 

The first 3 or so in the series were filled with a lot of skin, but after that more about Pablo and all of the craziness.

I did not know so much about his political aspirations which are very well covered in this.

I did not know he was a family man while murdering everyone around him. I did not know about his terrorist activities......quite shocking!

I did not know so many things I got to find out as if I were viewing the life of Escobar from the inside of his organization. 

I cannot recommend this series enough if you like crime drama. I had seen Wagner Moura in some solely Brazilian flicks but he is clearly amazing in this series! One of my favorite actors at this point.
