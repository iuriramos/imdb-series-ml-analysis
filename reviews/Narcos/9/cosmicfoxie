I'm really enjoying this well done Netflix series and quite amazing story about the advent of (prolific) Cocaine, colourful Columbia, the reality of Politics and International ($) Policy, the DEA, and Money... so much money! All centered around the contrary family man Pablo. Fast paced, well directed and acted plus good humoured despite the gravity. I can't speak Spanish so I'm not bothered by language technicalities or accents. Love quirky inclusions to explain context of story such as 'the cat'. Bring me some more magic please; "Magical realism is defined as what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe. There is a reason magical realism was born in Colombia"
