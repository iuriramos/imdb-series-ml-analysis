They should have used Colombian actors for this. Very bad accents in all principal actors. Also bad time line. the sequence is not good. The few Colombian actors appearing there do a very good job. The actor that plays Escobar forces too much all his dialogue, even to say bad words. That should be natural like in all the previous Colombian series about this same topic. This is the only one that makes Colombia see as a very weak country and that without foreign help would not have done anything against NARCOS. Some part of the story is not good, for example when M-19 releases Marta Nieves Ochoa. Lacks of research. Other topic is the subtitles, "plata o plomo" means you get money or you die, but not "silver or lead" like they posted. Thay should have hired someone from Colombia that knows all local expressions and again make someone to tell them naturally, not reading it with no sense
