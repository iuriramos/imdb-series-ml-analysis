I was really looking forward to this series, unfortunately, I had just previously watched another Netflix series Pablo Escobar: The Boss Of Evil also known as El patron del Mal, the actor Andres Parra, who was identical to Pablo Escobar even the mannerisms watch a youtube video of an interview and then watch the series and he is spot on.

Why they chose Wagner Moura to play the role of Pablo is beyond me, not the same accent and a far cry from the way Pablo looked and spoke. Maybe had I not watched the Boss of Evil first I might have swallowed Narcos much better but I saw two episodes and that was enough for me.

Some of the other actors are are spot on including El Mexicano and Pablos's wife but other than that since Wagner does play the main character his accent is not even close to Colombian which for me is difficult to swallow.
