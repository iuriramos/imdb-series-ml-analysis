I don't quite get why a nasty character like that gets so much attention from film makers. Anyway, it would be worth for the thrill and action. But no, this series is not about this. Overdoing the Elite Squad formula, there is a lot of voice over and very little real action. I watched half a dozen episodes and was really bored. I went to Wikipedia, read how the guy died and got free from the series.

The direction does not add adrenalin to the film, and Wagnoer Moura is not convincing the role of a blood thirsty drug dealer. He looks more like a family man protruding his belly to make it look bigger. One nice touch though is that most people speak the local language, what, I guess, it adventurous when aiming to an American audience that is used to all nationals, including ETs, speaking English all the time.
