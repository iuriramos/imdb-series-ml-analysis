Before watching this TV show I had already watched the 113 episodes of the original series 'Pablo Escobar, El patron del mal' that was broadcasted on Colombian TV stations a few years ago. I loved the way they told the story and I was impressed by many of the the actors. Specially Andres Parra who plays Pablo. Luckily enough I speak Spanish fluently and had no need for subtitles. Having this to compare with I noticed that the US version of the story, 'Narcos', had changed a lot of important things, had crammed things together and also invented a few new things I had problems believing. For starters the focus of the 'Narcos' is to show how thanks to USA and the work of an American in Colombia they where able to catch Escobar. But they left out the story of people that where really affected by him and the people that really did all the hard work. The Colombian newspapers, journalists, politicians, police and military. Shameful and also boring! The camera-work and cutting etc, and a few of the actors where perfectly OK, just a shame the story is so... wrong!
