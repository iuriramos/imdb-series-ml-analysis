Narcos is another great Netflix's original series and I could say that is as good as House of Cards. Great characters + great techniques + some dramatic licenses brings us one of the most interesting TV series nowadays. The series show us the war on drugs in a very realistic way, without idealism or many "hollywoodzation". We can actually feel the Escobar's power and all the tension that Colombia lived. Like The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones, it's not recommended get attached in some character, because a lot of them will die.
