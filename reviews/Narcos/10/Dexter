First episode and you will want to watch more and more. Because direction and acting both are perfect. This a real story mainly based on Pablo Escobar and a DEA officer and I can say this is pretty similar to the TV series the wire only this was all real. Storytelling way is best and Wagner was at his best I don't think anyone can act Pablo's role better than him.The actors are spot on and the scenes are amazing. I nearly feel that I'm in the Colombian jungle and the hot humid air touches me through the screen. I just love series nowadays. You can transport you self to nearly every situation of life and follow character for a long time. And they really use the advantages of series if you compare it to film.
