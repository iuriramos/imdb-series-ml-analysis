I wish I could see one more episode from the upcoming season, Netflix I love you..! I played this one out because I was genuinely excited for what I was watching. Instantly I jumped onto Netflix and I was not disappointed. The narration way of the story from the first beginning adds another depth to the story. 

It shows you scenes from the future then gets to the present to elaborate how we reached that point . This is a truly gripping show, one of the best I've seen this year. The characters and acting are done well and the story line moves at a fast enough pace to get your adrenaline pumping for the whole episode. A worthwhile watch, if you have interests in things other than comic books.
