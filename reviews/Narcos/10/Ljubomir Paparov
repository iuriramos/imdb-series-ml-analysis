I just watched the first three episodes of this new Netflix series and it is just awesome. The vintage 80's charm plus the good acting and the amazing story line will keep your attention like a fast paced action or thriller movie. 

It all begins as a one person who is supposes to be killed in Chile somehow survives a firing squad and goes to Columbia to offer his new product cocaine to the trafficking lord Pablo Escobar to sell it in Latin America. Escobar accepts the offer but moves the product to the USA where the price is higher. On the other side of the law in this series is USA DEA agent Murphy who is a young, dedicated and smart and he fights the new war on drugs in the USA and Columbia helped by a local man Javier Pena played by the one and only Oberyn Martell (GoT fans will understand).
