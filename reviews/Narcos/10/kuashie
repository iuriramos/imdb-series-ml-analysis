This series came at a time (in 2016) when 99.999% of the series released were garbage. It surprised me a lot because I thought 2016 was going to be the worst in TV series history.

This series keeps things unique, it uses Spanish or English where necessary. Acting from the main characters is great and believable. It doesn't drag its feet as if it were some soap (believe me I hate soap operas). There is some narration which is great and also doesn't disrupt the series at all.

So far the only problem I have seen the critics cry about is "wrong casting" and "ascent". If that is the only weak bad review they can make about this movie, then it shows you how good this show really is.

My advice is obvious, you should definitely check out this gem. The ratings don't lie like other trashes with high ratings.
