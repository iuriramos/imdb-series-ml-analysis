I used to watch many series at my collage time but then It was hard to find catchy and interesting. One of my friend highly suggest me and there was no hope from my side since I checked the cast list on IMDb anyway I gave a change and start to watch first episode and only 5 minutes I was fascinated by actors, music, cinematography and story line. 

I have watched first and two season within one week also started to watch documentary about Pablo Escobar. I wish the director would have focus more on Pablo Escobar the way how he rise and how he was cruel and all. I would love watch 4 seasons just with Pablo Escobar since he is such an interesting person. 

Oh God, I am completely fall in love with the actor who role Pablo Escobar.
