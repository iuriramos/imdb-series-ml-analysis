I just got Netflix couple weeks ago and i have been watching a lot of documentaries and other random stuff. When i came across NARCOS, I thought it was a documentary but I quickly realized it wasn't. This should be on TV but because of some of the nudity, which took me by surprise, I understand why they cant show this on TV. The production is amazing. The story-line is spectacular. The blend of real facts and some made up is amazing. You can't even tell whats real or whats made up. I am really upset because season 2 is so far away and I am on the last episode. :( But i will be waiting for this to come back on. If you haven't watched......you need to. This show is the best show I have ever seen so far.
