Extremely interesting and attracting movie that I highly recommend to all the movie fans out there! It has a lot of interesting scenes and videos from real reports on television that makes the movie even more and more interesting, plus the fact that there is all the time movie speaker that involves you more and more with the story itself. If you are fan of the dark deals and crime scenes this is the movie for you. The actors are playing very well specially the main actor that plays Pablo Escobar. My opinion about himself is that he have very good deep voice and he is the perfect choice for the role given by the Directors of the movie.
