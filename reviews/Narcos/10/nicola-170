Probably the best masterpiece that has ever been interpreted by non stars Hollywood celebrities. I cannot find the smallest negative remarks, from the scenes, to the smallest details that brings back into the seventies and what really the Medell√≠n Cartel meant in those years being way stronger than the government army. The scenes scare as if it was a documentary and not a movie. Quality wise one of the best if not the best series I have seen so far. Wonderful!

Only suggestion. The series contains plentiful of violence and sensitive scenes including drugs. I think it's not appropriate for minors and sensitive people.
