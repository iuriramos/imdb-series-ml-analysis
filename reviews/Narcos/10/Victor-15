Excellent production with an amazing result. It seems a symbiosis with POLICE SQUAD, CITY OF GOD and SCARFACE. The critics about Wagner's accent are legit. The diving in Colombia's culture, the producer's brave act in presenting the show with majority Spanish lines deserved a real Colombian actor. However, if the Wagner's performance is mediocre (or very little higher than that) and his accent is bad, everything else pays off the work. The cinematography, the editing, the soundtrack, the script, the narrative technique, the application of real and historical photos and videos, all of this is great! I'm looking forward for the next season.
