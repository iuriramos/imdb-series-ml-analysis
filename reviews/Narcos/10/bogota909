the best portrayal of the real Medellin cartel, bar none" I'm Colombian and have done research intensely on Colombian cartels then and now.. Love the authenticated this is better then blow,yes people i said blow!!! love the real dialogue, for the most part using real Colombian actors overall 9/10 Heres what i would critiqued The dull acting from the portrayal of American dea agents, and the wife is a horrible actress, give the man credit that played escobar did a great job needed to work on his accent overall good 7.5/10 his portrayal, they also needed to talk about key figures of the medellin cartel including transporters mickey Monday's, john Robert's, George Jung and especially Griselda blanco and Fabio Ochoa.. Hope in season 2 they are shown!!
