Intense and remarkable 

Honestly I did not know the whole story of Pablo Escobar , just knew he was a very powerful drug dealer which spread terror in Colombia for many years!

Since the first episode that i see, i found myself addicted. 

I was very curious about the story of Pablo Escobar , and after seeing the true story of him in other documentaries , and searching on google and after that i see that the NETFLIX retract profoundly well this TVShow, let me completely in a vicious cycle till the end !

Amazing series!
