I was looking for a new series to watch and came across Narcos. There was some hype about it when it premiered but I never gave it time of day till recently. I couldn't believe I had deprived myself of such greatness this long. This show is beautifully cast, written, acted and is pure perfection. I have been glued to my laptop screen and have pretty much become obsessed. There is so much to love about this show and it only gets better by the seasons. Can't wait to see what the writes and directors have in store for us going forward. Such a great, amazing and captivating show. I would urge you to watch it NOW if you haven't joined the club yet ;)
