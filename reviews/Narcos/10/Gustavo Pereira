It is just amazing to see Netflix doing a great series those days. I can't wait the next season. 

I know they have a lot more to tell us. But I think 13 episodes would be just great, 10 always let me down.

Wagner Moura is doing a excellent job playing Pablo and even without having Spanish as main language it doesn't bother me. The direction, production, photograph, costume, make up and overall locations is just great.

Keep the great job Netflix, well done!
