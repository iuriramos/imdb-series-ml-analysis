From youtube - "Imagine that you are born in a poor familia and in a poor country (pais) and by the time you are 28 years old, you have so much money that you can't even count!"

Pablo Escobar Gaviria is all about "Plata y Plomo (Silver or Lead)" doctrine and philosphyin his life that has substantially changed the narco ecosystem in '80s. This economics of narco disruption is well depicted in narcos. It is all supply and demand from low wage country to a higher wage country in parallel to least developed country to highly developed country!

Great TV show, crew members, directors, producers, writers!
