Man Wagner Maura will always will be close to my heart for his Pablo escobar role.i wished they would have removed the death part and take that Pablo rose again to his power reclaiming his throne and become presidante .Pablo escobar was a person that must be killed but Wagner role made me his follower his ego,power,body language man give me a break all were superb. i never cried in any movies or show if i recon but the final scene where Pablo meets Gustavo man heart breaking i lost the count playing the scene again and again i wished Wagner continued till season 4 because i have no more interest watching the rest of the season.I didn't started to watch Narcos because of him but i will stop watching because of him i just wish Pablo became EL-PRESIDENTE just in the show man.I HAVE NOTHING TO DO MORE CAUSE NARCOS IS OVER AND HAVE NO Interest IN 3-4 SEASON OR AMURICANS
