***No Spoilers*** Honest writing, with evidence and brave directing have made us a show that we're going to love.

Narcos is a biography theme show with great drama and story line. The show actually filmed where the story all happens which is in Colombia. The cast and crew are mostly from the South America and the acts are just perfect. Beside all of these things the whole story is fascinating for itself cause it's fresh and unique.

If you like to see the truth behind what happened to Pablo Eskobar in the late 80th and early 90th, then you must see this great show.

And you can be sure this is totally worth the time to watch.

Thanks to Netflix,

we have another perfect show in the golden era of TV.
