I don't understand how this show is rated 8.9 and not 10.0 on IMDb. The moment the second season premiered at night I watched it right away. It is the best show I have ever seen and my heart was racing at the end when they killed Escobar. The suspense, the action, the emotions I felt through watching this is unexplainable. I binged the first season several amount of times I lost count! This should be named the greatest TV series in the world! I can not wait for a third season!!! who will be the next villain?? El Chapo?? Who knows but I can't wait for another season! Another binge added to the list! Best show in the world 10 out of 10! Plata o Plomo?
