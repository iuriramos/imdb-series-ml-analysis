I've only watched 1 episode so far and I am almost certain I am going to like the rest of the episodes.

When I watched the first episode of House of Cards I had the exact same feeling. Yes the show is completely different, but you need to pay attention right away and you don't have to wait 3/4 episodes to get into this show.

I knew just a little bit about Pablo Escobar, since I am only 21 years old and I just found out I was born in the year he was killed. The story so far is very interesting and rough, it is basically about how Cocaine smuggling between Colombia and the USA started. This is coming with some insane facts, that I was surprised by.

There is an American voice (same actor as the DEA agent) explaining how the stories goes in the background quite frequently. I am glad that he is doing that, since the Colombians are speaking Spanish instead of English for a change, so the English voice explaining the story is a nice contribution. Well done Netflix! 

Trust me, go and watch this show as soon as possible! Netflix has once again shown that they are good competition for the big TV stations, or in my opinion even outgrowing the competition.

P.S. you don't have to wait a week for the next episode, like your normally do with TV stations!
