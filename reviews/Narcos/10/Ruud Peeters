We've already seen the release of several good Netflix originals, including Orange Is The New Black, Daredevil and House Of Cards. I'm currently halfway through the first season of Narcos, and I can definitely say that Netflix has nailed it again. 

From the Goodfellas-like voice-over to the speedy (pun intended) editing of the violence and drugs scenes, Narcos offers a The Wire kind of look on the rise of Escobar's cocaine empire in the 70's and 80's. It relates to The Wire, because the screen time is evenly divided between the 'good and the bad', between the ruthless Escobar (played magnificently by Brazilian actor Wagner Moura, who I already loved in Tropa De Elite), the Colombian government and two DEA agents from America. Even the CIA and president Reagan are there. Everyone is involved.

Narcos doesn't joke around or turn its back to the sheer drug terror that reigned in that era; expect full-frontal shots of violence, drugs, nudity and more. I did like the fact that they mixed these particular scenes with actual archive footage.

Although Narcos ultimately does not reach the same dazzling heights as The Wire or Breaking Bad - let's not kid ourselves; only The Sopranos might come close - it's absolutely, 100%, worth a watch, and a great addition to the already impressive 2015 list of Netflix Originals. 

Bring on Season 2!
