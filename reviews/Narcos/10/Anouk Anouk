This gotta be the best TV series of 2015!!! It is just stunning, starting worth the story itself, continuing with the great interpretation of Pablo, with the perfect surroundings, with the story narrated by the DEA, the music...every little thing is simply greatly put together, with the right people and the talented people to offer you the perfect TV series EVER!

The story itself it's like you've imagined: the life of a drug dealer is presented. But this drug trafficker it is not your usual. He loves his family, he loves his children, he is dedicated to Colombia and he wants Colombia to have a better life. He is Evil and Good, he is the Devil, but he might have been an angel, in another circumstances.

Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria is a powerful man, a real man, a truly dominant character, a strong personality with a great willingness to do whatever it's needed to protect his gang and his family, to protect his business and to succeed in his mission. The way Wagner Moura does this role is simply artistic, it is most of all, believable and makes you think you are having that character right in front of your eyes. He lives his role, he feels his role and he wants his role. Therefore, he does a masterpiece in his interpretation. 

The way the 80's are brought to us, the way the atmosphere of Colombia is brought to life, you just think you are back in time, it's all done so perfectly! 

I truly recommend this series for whoever wants to have a quality time and to have a story to think about after the episode has ended. It makes you wonder about life, about life most important decisions and makes you feel the adrenaline, the suspense and the irony of the human existence. It is truly a remarkable true story brought to us from great professionals, great directors, actors, one that will surely conquer you and make you ADDICTED! :) 

PS: If you liked shows like Dexter, then, this one's for you!
