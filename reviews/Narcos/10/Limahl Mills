This show caught my attention as soon I saw the trailer. Such a detailed and well thought out TV series I cannot wait until the next season. I learned quite a lot from the show as I didn't know as much as I thought about the Pablo Escobar story. 

What I found was the usage of stock footage relating to the actual times Pablo ran Columbia I thought was very well done. The music was amazing. Even though this was subtitled it didn't bother me one bit and felt as if I was speaking and understand everything in real time. The cast was a very good one, some interesting characters. The sheer ruthlessness really had my attention throughout and will probably watch this season again very soon :)
