I'm mid season when I write this "review", and I am just mind blown, its awesome, its like a mix between true detectives, a documentary and breaking bad, and some game of thrones, yes I am talking about tits, all set in the '80's just watch it, I guarantee is as addictive as coke, the drug not the soda, nothing is as addictive as the carbonated refreshing drink. Wagner Moura gives a extraordinary performance embodying the "villain" ( more like a antihero) Pedro Pascal is stellar, as his best as a gray cop (more like a gray jedi), proving once again that millions of fans have been wright when they cried after his GoT early exit (early in the sens of not having more screen time) there is more to say about this show, but I am in the middle of binge watching it. also perfect timeing release.

ps the art is quite special indeed, from the soundtrack to the posters/wallpapers
