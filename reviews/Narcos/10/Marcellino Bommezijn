When NARCOS was released on Netflix i was afraid it was another poor attempt to picture the story of Pablo Escobar, but i was completely wrong. The storyline is really fantastic and realistic. Great directing work and superb performed by the actors. Especially because there are a lot of less known actors in this series, but they all perform as A+ actors. Especially 'Limon', that sticks with Escobar to the bitter end, is outstanding and gives a great picture of the 'Patron' vs 'Soldado'.

The 'background' storytelling by agent Murphy is a great feature in this series and gives the viewer a 'just enough' inside of what is going on and the actual facts of what really happened. This made me watch the series and at the same time pulled me into the actual events/scenes which gave me goosebumps sometime, because i tried to imagine what it would be if i was in the same position as some of the characters with all the violence and risks they take to earn money and get respect in the narco business.

Pablo Escobar character played by Wagner Moura is at it's finest. The sudden shifts between being a 'nice person' and 'the devil' is perfectly done. Without ever knowing what kind of person the real Pablo Escobar was, this translation of him by Wagner Moura is certainly 99,9% realistic. I actually just found out in episode 8 or 9 that Wagner Moura is the actor in the 2 'Elite Squad' movies. These movies are about a police squad in Rio de Janeiro. These are also a 'must see'. 

This series will certainly will go into history as one of the best that tell the story of Pablo Escobar. 20 years from now this series will still be popular.
