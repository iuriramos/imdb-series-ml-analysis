So i saw the Trailer of Narcos on an image board and i was hyped from the very beginning. I binge-watched the series multiple times and i couldn't get enough, so i watched a documentation about Escobars Son and i bought the biography of Escobar. After reading the biography, the series gets even more authentic, because it's not exaggerated (like e.g. Braveheart was), it's a documentation packed in a cool, thrilling series. A great plus is that the "colombians" speak Spanish, so it's realistic (even tho i had to read a lot of subtitles, because i watched the series in English/Spanish with English subtitles and my mother tongue is swiss German).
