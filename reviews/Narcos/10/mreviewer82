Spectacular show with phenomenal performances. Wagner Moura is a revelation as Escobar, making him charismatic, enigmatic, repulsive, murderous, monstrous, and sympathetic all at once. Each show has the look, feel, and edge of a feature-level film, and best of all it doesn't cop out by making it all English language. Rather, it's a mostly Spanish language series with English narration. This is by far the most engaging, memorable, and insightful look into Escobar's life and persona, and it also creates vivid, well-developed supporting characters in its supporting case (namely detective Pena stands out). Overall, "Narcos" is brilliantly directed, expertly acted, and efficiently produced.
