I initially avoided watching Narcos, because I was expecting an over-the-top, violent series, full of unpleasant characters. Once I started watching however, I found a beautifully written, beautifully acted drama, full of compelling three-dimensional characters. Part of what works about Narcos is that its look at the rise of the drug cartels in Colombia is told through the eyes of American DEA agent Steve Murphy. Murphy is neither saint nor sinner, but a likable, relatable figure, doing his best to make sense out of the chaos that was Colombia in the 80's. Wagner Moura's portrayal of Pablo Escobar--part evil genius, part paranoid--is nuanced and riveting. And it should be mentioned that even though men drive the story in Narcos, there is still room for interesting female characters. Unlike many shows about violent subcultures, the women are far more than simply props in Narcos. Full kudos to Netflix for producing yet another adult, intelligent show. Along with another Netflix creation, Master of None, Narcos stands as one of the top TV shows of 2015.
