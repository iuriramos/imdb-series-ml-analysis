I usually don't write reviews but I felt an obligation to urge you to watch this tremendous production. It is truly a powerful experience worthy of your time. I watched it over the course of 2 days. Like House of Cards, I'll watch it again before Season 2. It is in the same league as The Sopranos in many ways. Tony and Pablo - similar egos but Pablo was a real person and made billions. As in the Sopranos, viewers see both sides of the criminal vs. the law conflict, with no hints of what happens next. The cinematography is excellent which allows viewers to experience the beauty of Colombia even as death and destruction fills the country with fear. The violence factor is a 10 but the story couldn't be told without it. I strongly recommend "Narcos" as a new Netflix epic.
