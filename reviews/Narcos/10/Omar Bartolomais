When Padilha bring to us Robocop reboot I was really sad to see one of the greatest mind in show business just vanish. I recently see a interview when he move out to Los Angeles, because Brazil become dangerous to he an his family, consequence of his movies about dirt Brazilian cops, and he have been attack on his studio back in Rio De Janeiro, and now I see he was right, he did again, the great Jose Padilhais back. I love Wagner Moura, and all the scenes of Pablo Escobar is just amazing. Resuming, this series is solid, just another Breaking Badlike, but with new stuff and Padilha's scenes, AMAZING! Jus watch this amazing show, too realistic and fun...
