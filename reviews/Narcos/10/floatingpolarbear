It's easy to get pulled into this story from the beginning and crave more and more episodes. The scenes are elaborate yet short, giving a natural feel to the story as if you're getting glimpses of a really intimate documentary. Not only is the pace entertaining but the dramatic turning points are fascinatingly portrayed to take you right there in the midst of Colombian society experiencing all these shocking events and inside the minds of the characters on all sides of the battle as they try to calculate their next move. You've got a furious torrent of money coming into a segment of society that is purely made up of sociopaths, an unprepared and underpaid police force being made mincemeat of or simply being paid to look the other way and a political string of characters that range from corruptible opportunists to saintly martyrs trying to stave the tide against impossible odds. The houses that people have, the lifestyle, the restaurants, caf√©s, streets, types of interactions, all is authentic down to the smallest detail. It's a delight and it has really made me want to pick up a book and read more about this bloody and interesting struggle of good and evil and in between.
