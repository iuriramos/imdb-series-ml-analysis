Narcos in one word? Addicting, ironic I know but there is no better way to describe one of the best TV shows ever .

Narcos tells the story of the rise and fall of the Medellin Cartel and much like the rise and fall of the Cartel the series toys unpredictably with our emotions and often keeps us on the edge of our seats. The show fully immerses you into the world of the Medellin Cartel which is a testament to the great directing and cinematography.

The show boasts some of the best action/chase scenes and a great script with well thought out characters and narration but what makes Narcos a standout in the golden age of television is its unparalleled ability to create an atmosphere filled with suspense and tension. The shows incredible atmosphere coupled with the afore mentioned creates incredible highs and lows that keeps you coming back for more.

The only fault of the show is that most of the show is in Spanish with English been spoken approximately thirty to forty percent of the time, there are also English subtitles which are sufficient, regardless Narcos is a truly brilliant show produced by Netflix and in typical Netflix fashion it doesn't disappoint. The show is a unique must watch.
