This is by far the best thing I ever saw about the life of Pablo Escobar and the Colombian crisis. Everything in this show is perfect. The actors are sublime, every actor is very believable in his role. The narrating voice through the whole series works really well to me. Also the real video fragments from the news in that time between the fiction works really well. I was completely addicted to this show after the first episode. I saw the whole season in a couple days. Can't wait for season two honestly. If all series would be at the same level as this one I would probably never set a foot outside anymore and just watch television all day. Narcos will definitely be the show of the year. Great job from Netflix!
