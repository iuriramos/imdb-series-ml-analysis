This is a good series. Most of the actors did a commendable job (Including Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie as Pablo's mom). Although I do understand that Netflix wants to appeal to a global viewership, I must admit that the inaccuracy of many of the accents was very distracting. So it was the lack of Spanish fluency in some of the actors "forced" to speak in Spanish. Also, I do not agree with some of the nativist comments -nor endorse English as the lingua franca- but the bilingual format was not very successful -in my view. Production values are high but I have seen several Colombian narco telenovelas that are better product than Narcos. Entertaining yet not Netflix best product.
