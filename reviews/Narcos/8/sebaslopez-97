This show is good, well done, entertaining, very good for Netflix. But the rating it's got (9.1 at the moment) is misleading. There's no point of comparison between this show and masterpieces like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Dexter, or even Lost. 

It's good, I enjoyed it, but the rating is ridiculously high. Although the plot is great my major issue with it is that the Escobar's story has been highly exploited as well as that from other drug lords, it's not original, another point of view doesn't make it original.

I encourage you to watch it, if you like action and the and are looking for entertaining this won't disappoint you, but please don't watch it instead of Breaking Bad or any of the ones I've cited. In case you're just intrigued by Escobar's history "Pablo Escobar, √Ångel o Demonio" (imdb: tt1031952) is a great documentary IMO.
