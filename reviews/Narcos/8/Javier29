It surprised me despite the decision of give the lead role to a Brazilian actor who hardly could speak in the Colombian accent.

in the first season they show a good product involving different points of conflict (DEA, the Colombian government and the drugs cartel) mixing real events with fiction. Really like the soundtrack specially the opening the song fits with rhythm that you imagine for this kind of series.

It contains some good violence and actions takes. And the narrator in this case a character explains the context of that time where the drugs cartel had a huge power and influence.

The second season is coming next year so if you haven't see it give it a chance. Score 8/10
