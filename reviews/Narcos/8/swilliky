The second season of the Netflix original series Narcos continues to tell the story of Columbia, Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura), and the DEA. The first season captured the rise of Escobar to great wealth and prominence in the business of cocaine, and the second season captures his fall. Frustrated after the prison escaped that capped off the first season, the DEA and CIA turn to more drastic methods to overcome Pablo and his gang of thugs by making allies with many questionable characters.

One great thing about the show is that all of the Columbian characters speak Spanish and there are only a few parts with English including a voice-over narration by the DEA Agent Steve Murphy (Boyd Holbrook). Holbrook does a great job as the frustrated agent the narration helps put the narrative into historical perspective. Moura is wonderful as Escobar who slowly grows frustrated when his crew begins to disappear and he watches his empire crumble and his family come under threat. Pedro Pascal is also phenomenal as the conflicted DEA agent Javier Pe√±a who makes a deal with the devil in his fight against corruption and cocaine.
