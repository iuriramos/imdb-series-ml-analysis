First of all I'd like to mention that I started watching this show for two reasons: Crime and Pedro Pascal. I may come across shallow for the latter, but that's what it is.

So, while we have got a stellar cast and in fact they do speak Spanish (something I appreciate, even though I do not speak a word of Spanish and I do not know whether they have gotten the accents right), there are some flaws. The characters seem somewhat one- dimensional. I wish we could have found out more about Javier and his colleagues. 

The one thing which really was a major turn off: Murphy. He is the typical picture of an ignorant American dude coming to a country without bothering to actually learn some of Columbia's language. Second: he is portrayed in a way of 'I am the American, you all suck because you treat me as I should be treated by how ignorant I am'. There are some scenes with him that just made me roll my eyes, and I am uncertain if this was the intention of the writers and director; I can only hope. 

Then there is the narrative storytelling... which I would like if it was a documentary. The mix of series/documentary works well if done right, and I do not like the way it is done. The first episode is slow and dragging. The second episode makes up for that, but still.

For the rest I'm pleasantly surprised, there'll always be some mistakes done, or some flaws in execution, but I did admire Pedro's portrayal of Javier and I do like to utter the wish for a second season... however am I not very sure if they will pursue such an idea. 

In short:

If you're looking for a crime show about drugs and politics, go watch it. If you're interested in Pedro Pascal and you are curious whether he is as great as he was as Oberyn: go watch it, too. we'll probably see a lot more of him soon anyway. It's a nice show; somewhere between good and amazing, thrilling, and witty even.

Thank you, Netflix.
