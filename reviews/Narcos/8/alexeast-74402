Firstly I must say that I really enjoyed both seasons. The story of Pablo Escobar has always been one that fascinated me from an early age and Narcos did not disappoint.

I think its important to say that although it is based on his life, it is certainly not a true account of his life. The producers have used artist license and at times embellished and even created events for dramatic effect. Once you make your peace with this, and take it for what it is, its a really enjoyable ride - but one that you must not take too seriously.

I live in Panama and have visited Medellin many times - I can understand the frustration of Spanish speakers when they complain about the casting of Pablo. No he doesn't have a Paisa accent and there isn't even an attempt at one. For me that was fine - I guess the producers deemed this to be of little importance. Is his Spanish perfect? No. Will Netflix's major demographic audience realize? Probably not - they're too busy trying to keep up with the subtitles. And I guess for those Spanish speakers who are really put off by the accent there's always the excellent Pablo Escobar: El Patron de Mal.
