Wow... Did the producers ever do a great job of portraying a dislikable monster. I've read lots of criticism of Wagner Moura's accent. I didn't pick up on it as I don't speak any Spanish. However, I felt he did an amazing job of making you feel sick at the heinous nature of the Character he played. Right down to the poor posture, dumpy physique, and tasteless clothes including ever-present white runners. 

But his appearance was only the frosting on the cake. Escobar was convincingly portrayed as a conscienceless mass-murderer of many innocent people. And like many sociopaths portrayed in film, we are shown these villains agonizing over the loss of and harms to people they care about such as their own families and friends. 

How could a person order the killing of innocent women and children then turn around and be all drippy sentimental about the loss of his drug-trafficking, murdering Family member being killed..... And then pining his loss while creating a scrap book of gushy memories of him? What about the families of the people he killed? No gushy sentiment over their losses. Just cold blooded murder. 

If 1/10th of the portrayal is accurate, Escobar must have been an evil, evil man. 

I thought the production was refreshing. Not too much Hollywood flash and polish. Believable characters and settings.
