As a Latino I was a bit worried that this show was going to be too Americanised and butchered but it turn out really well. It's a well thought out show linking nicely to historical events with a very natural flowing timeline.

I know some people are complaining that Moura doesn't attempt a Medellin accent (though he does a decent general Colombian one) and that Luis Guzman just speaks in his native North American accent and of course that's odd and does unfortunately takes a little bit away from the realism of the show but it far from makes the show poor.

My main criticism of the show is that they could (and should) have condensed this series into 7 episodes. There was a little too much filler in the second half of the season. If they had done that I would have given this show easily a 9 or perhaps even a very rare, from me, 10.
