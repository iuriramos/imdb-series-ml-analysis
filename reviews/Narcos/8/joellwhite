I have something to say about the initial complaints about the language thing. I can see why it was done. The actor playing Escobar was, of all things, Brazilian... etc. Thing is, for an international platform like NETFLIX this kind of thing is, actually, necessary. It's also true-to- life as seen from the perspective of the Gringo DEA guy: 

It is safer to NOT learn 'Spanish' at all, than to learn a version of 'Spanish' that identifies you with a region, ethnicity, or group. I learned this during my time as a street-level White Guy backup in the Crack Wars in inner-city USA. I met a founding member of MS-13; Dominicans; Hondurans; Mexicans. I met folks from Chiapas that not only didn't speak English, they didn't speak Spanish of any kind!

Guatemalans; Panamanians. Guys from Belize! They were all convinced THEIR version of 'Spanish' was the Best One Of All. And they would KILL you if they thought you had learned another version: osmosis: 'How could you know this much of my enemies' inflection, if you are not one with him?'

NETFLIX blended the dialects, and it is the right thing to do. I really like this show. It's pretty smart. As much as I can really 'like' anything about the mayhem that went on in the late 1980s-1990s. 

Savages.
