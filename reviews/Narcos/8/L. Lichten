I caution the writers against writing such unsympathetic characters. There has to be at least one sympathetic character in the story that the audience cares enough about to keep tuning in  and after finishing season 1, given this writing style, I don't care what happens to Escobar, Murphy/DEA, or the Colombian government. The most sympathetically-portrayed character is Peña. Is he the protagonist? The most sympathetically-portrayed "side" is the Colombian government. Is that the writers' aim? If not, you need to fix the characters and script. 

Viewers tune in to see story, but whether they admit it or not, they also tune in to see with which slant the characters and their actions are portrayed. In other words, not just story, but how it is told. The writers seem neutral, and it seems cowardly to not have a real stance on the story and/or its characters. Writers, you need to choose a side and write accordingly. Are you trying to make viewers love the narcos or the Colombian govt? Are you trying to make viewers hate the CIA and love the DEA? Or hate the DEA because they have contempt for the CIA? 

Lack of backbone in the writing is why viewers are left with a moral dilemma at the end of the show. Don't put your viewers in that spot. Writers should make their own judgments, that way the viewer only has to decide whether they agree or disagree with the show's stance, not be faced with storytelling that forces viewers to decide what they feel, think, or believe. Viewers still tune in to shows with stances they dislike, so don't remain neutral in the hopes of not offending people. Fire them up, make them cry, make them mad, make them SOMETHING  you decide that, as a writer. But don't leave it with them having to decide how to feel, and most of all, don't leave them feeling nothing.
