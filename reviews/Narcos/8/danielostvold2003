To start off with, the show is excellent. Following Pablo, Steve and Pena with their breath taking moments is just plain up amazing. However, the reason why I am writing this review is to actually comment on one thing. 

Namely, episode 9 Nuestra Finca from Season 2 had one unnecessary scene with the little girl and the mom. The action that happen here just made my blood boil of anger and pain. I personally think that this scene was unnecessary to leave so explicit. Because, this scene is not the reason why I started watching Narcos, it was just too brutal and left me awake for a few hours.
