From Netflix, Narcos it's an American crime/drama series that follows the true story of drug lord Pablo Escobar and the constant fight against drugs and traffic of influence in Colombia.

The most interesting aspect of this series for me, personally, is getting to know the history of Colombia, a country so far away for me and that I know so little. Besides that, it has a rich cast (although most of them aren't Colombian) which play their parts very well. It's a real story with an impressive atmosphere and direction.

The narrative style gives it a different aspect which helps the viewer engage in a more aware and informed way, contextualizing the culture and the story itself.

It's exciting and fast paced, it makes you want to keep coming back for more. Seriously impressed with this one. Curious to know where it's going.
