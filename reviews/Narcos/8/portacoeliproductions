The show is very entertaining and touch a lot of the well documented life of Pablo Escobar and the rest of The Cartel. Everything looks legit, the only thing I dislike and I'm pretty sure a lot of Latinos will agree is that casting a Brazilian to do the most famous Colombian of all time is whack, the guy can't pronounce Spanish properly, let alone the distinctive Colombian accent.I guess since it's a Brazilian production they wanted one of their own. But if you don't care about the bad accent, then Narcos is a good show for you. It's a great touch to use actual footage of Colombia (1989-93) and many of the picture of the era. Still, the only reason I can't give 10/10 is because of the accents ( Luis Guzman, a fine Puerto Rican actor, as Rodriguez Gacha is plain dumb ).
