I cannot believe they chose a Brazilian to play Pablo Escobar, nothing against the Brazilians or their actors, but you are talking about a person from Medellin, Colombia and they speak way different than other Colombians. We have great Colombian actors that could have played Pablo better and with the Paisa Accent like the real Pablo. Please producers, directors and everyone involved in making films and movies and series, use actors from the country you are making a movie about. It's like using a white guy to play a black guy. Really!!!!! This tells me that you are probably new to this field and have no idea how important it is to get the best actors for your film. I love Brazil and the people from there and nothing against them for acting or whatever, it's just that you have to be realistic and try and make the movie the most realistic one so that we the audience can identified and understand the true events that occur. Thank you,
