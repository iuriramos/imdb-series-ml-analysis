The most unpleasant thing is that the main character of the series is not Colombian, not fluent in Spanish, much less can even come close to what the accent of Colombia, or specifically of Medellin. A poor presentation begins. Notably, another people have already made several productions to express the theme here highlights, however these earlier productions are truly extraordinary, which is increasingly opaque this poor production. Worth putting this out, because other characters in the series, are Colombian and represent their roles very well. But what a problem, not the protagonist. Moreover no fundamental issues of this story as it is the original culture of the facts either expressed. You can not import a different culture because it changes the basic facts. Not express the culture and so give little importance to elements that actually are important is a lost and becomes, or would become a production expressing either a subject that is not linked to actual facts. And yet that's where the series worse it gets, because it is not capable of expressing a script with an original and captivating drama. The participation of third-person narration might have been good but the truth is that the opportunity to take advantage was lost. Anyway. VERY BAD
