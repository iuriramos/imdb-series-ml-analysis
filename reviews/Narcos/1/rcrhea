Moura, who plays Escobar, is Brazilian and has a laughable Spanish accent. It sounds like he has a box of rocks in his mouth. If you speak Spanish, you simply cannot watch this show... it's really that bad. How many friggin' Colombian actors are there that could have nailed this part? 

Allegedly Netflix is trying to create Spanish language content for Spanish speakers. They failed miserably with this first attempt. Show some respect for the language by casting people who can speak localized dialects and languages. It's not that difficult if you have the right consultants. Only non-Spanish speakers could enjoy this show. What a crock.
