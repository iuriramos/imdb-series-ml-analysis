The dialogue and commentary are in French, Spanish, and German with foreign language sub-titles or text for the hearing impaired. Supposedly, there are some English bits. Not sure I will wait for them. Netflix apparently decided to make Narcos "real" by using foreign languages just like in real life. Why not real blood and real cocaine, etc.? Dumb idea. I called Netflix HQ, thinking that maybe I had neglected to select the English option. Pleasant dude assisted me and discovered that the series is supposed to be unintelligible to us morons who do not speak three languages and English. My bad. If I had known this series was coming, I would have taken more languages in H.S. Ten minutes in, I quit. There seemed to be informative detail in the dialogue and in the talk of the narrator. You polyglots can feel superior. Maybe you will record each episode and post it on youtube with you translating (into English, please!).
