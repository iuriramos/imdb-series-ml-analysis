The entire show is in Spanish, it's sad to see a potential good show wasted this way. I mean even while making this very review the Guide lines for it state " Please write in English only." 

Those are the guide lines for this site, I wouldn't have even tried to watch this show if I knew I had to read a book instead of watch a TV show. 

Whats the point? All you do is stair at the bottom of the screen, nobody is going to watch this unless they know Spanish. They could have saved a lot of money just writing down the script and making a book instead of adding background noise to the on screen book you are being forced to read.
