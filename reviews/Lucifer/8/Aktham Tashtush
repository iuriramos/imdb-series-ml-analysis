The show started so strong ,, with tight plot .. and a smoothly flowing organized events >>> I am so eager to see what's gonna happen on the next episode .. New case ... new dark comedy, the humor and smug faces by Lucifer ... you literally start rooting for the devil in this one :D

The idea of the show is so fresh and original, The script is perfectly written , 4 writers so far which adds to the show the element of unpredictability and thrill .. and it looked like the screenplay was polished and edited in so many level to be spotless and having no noticeable holes.

As for the cast, for shows like these picking up a British accent with a Deceptive ravishing face like Tom Ellis was a one hell of choice , and bravo for his performance so far as it shows some perfection and craftiness ,, as for the rest of cast they're all engaging and fun to watch ,, and as i'v noticed with huge possibility of a new set of characters as the crimes rolls.

Since NBC has axed Constantine i'v been praying that a show will come to have that charm and attracting plot , and honestly this show appears to have a great potentials to be Fox's new Hit show ... and i only hope they just keep up the Ingenuity level we saw in the pilot.

Overall ,, bravo for Fox for this clever move on Distributing this and before that on making a humongous Advertising campaign and i do hope to see it grow as the 2015 Fall Hit show :)
