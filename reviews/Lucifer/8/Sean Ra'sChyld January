The truth is, no show is without its faltering points. It is a bit on the tame side. It overly tries to downplay Lucifer's dark side, never actually allowing him to punish anyone but does an amazing job getting the viewer to feel and understand his plight. He is the torturer, the punisher, and justice bringer. He is not the monster humanity makes him out to be. Similar to Hades in Greek mythology. He's just a guy who's given a crap job and all that is bad is blamed on him. The acting is spot on for most characters. I wish they would let him loose for an episode or two and I think for the finale, they might. Overall a great show. Do not go the Constantine route with heavy foreshadowing of some dark force brewing. Supernatural has beaten that horse to death.
