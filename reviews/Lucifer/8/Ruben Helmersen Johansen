As a fan of the supernatural, I was intrigued when I heard about Lucifer. However, seeing as I've been burned before, I started watching it with relatively low expectations. I was positively surprised by the shows' wittiness and clever dialogue. The devil is portrayed as a charming fellow who knows his way around the ladies; at least till he meets officer Chloe Dancer. His cheekiness and sarcasm makes him a breath of fresh air compared to the characters often found in supernatural shows, where the devils and demons are constantly acting as if they have a stick up their behind. Lucifer is not trying to be dark and mysterious, but fast-paced and humorous. At least that is my perception after watching the pilot. I will follow this show and hope it will continue this promising trend.
