The first season of Lucifer took me by surprise. Considering that the reviews here are very mixed I was not really sure whether I should watch it or not, so I decided to watch the pilot and get an opinion of my own.

The first season is pretty much "crime of the week". There is nothing wrong with that. But considering that there already are many shows that revolves around that, and considering the source material, I wish for more development of the plot in season 2. And since mother dearest now has escaped from hell I might just get my wish. The characters that the show circles around are also good. Especially Lucifer himself. He is funny, witty (and also a good musician). He also have both a darker more sinister side that I hope we see more of in the future. Tom Ellis really does a good job here.

I like the whole "sympathy for the devil" thing Lucifer has. It really works here. This series has all the potential to be a really great TV-show.
