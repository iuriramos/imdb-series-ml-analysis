No one can take this show too seriously. If you do you're missing the point of it. It's entertaining. It's fun to watch. The title character gives the viewer enough personality to keep you interested, while the plots and other characters are all there for him to play off of.

I was glad they didn't change much of the format for the season two opener. Too often shows forget what made them successful in the first place and try to expand on that...which usually ends up getting chaotic. Lucifer seems to be maintaining it's appeal.

The only thing I don't like is that Lucifer is kinda wimpy. For a spiritual being, which should be strength the likes of which we can't even imagine, he gets beat up a lot.

All-in-all, it's just a fun show to watch. The addition of Lucifer's "mum" at the end might be an interesting new twist. We'll have to wait and see.
