There are people who believe Lucifer and Satan are not the same. Why are you complaining now when DC Lucifer was created somewhere in the 90s. If the bible should not be taken literally why would the audience of this show think it is true that Lucifer is good. The show does not preach to worship Satan and who on earth would take the show seriously. This show is based on a DC character not Lucifer from the bible which says that Lucifer and Satan are the same besides there are people who does not read the bible. The title of the show caught my attention and when watched the pilot episode it was great. Tom Ellis's acting fits. I did not know that DC Comics had a character Lucifer. There were some part I did not like but Lucifer and Chloe, Tom Ellis's acting, some funny moments made it all worth watching.
