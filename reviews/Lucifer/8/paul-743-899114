I stopped reading comics when I was about 13 (which is quite a while ago), and I have never heard of the one that bred this character. Also, I normally hate this genre as well as any others re super-heroes, vampires and the devil etc: I find them downright silly. However, I've stuck through the first two episodes and have surprised myself.

After almost giving up after the first ten minutes I battled on regardless and found Lucifer to be pretty good entertainment. Mind you, if it wasn't for Tom Ellis I think it would sink. Like a lot of American TV now it is well made and acted, and with high production values - where do they get the money from?

Even though I'm British I can't recollect seeing Ellis in anything else. But he's good with lots of charisma, and perfect for this part.
