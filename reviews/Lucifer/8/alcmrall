So Fox has a show out about the devil... how ironic... 

Lucifer really does have some great qualities as a show. The British accent really does wonders any time the devil makes a joke. He sounds snarky, edgy, and smart all at the same time. However, Lucifer gets old fast. 

I'd find myself in a personal Hell if someone invited themselves over all the time without asking or decided to sneak in and make breakfast while I was in the shower. Lucifer constantly manipulates himself into Detective Chloe Decker's life at every turn. However, her annoyance for him isn't enough to justify how completely obnoxious it would be in her position. In fact, she says at one point that she enjoys working with him. 

However, something has me binge watching this show. There is something remarkable about Fox doing a spin on the Devil and trying to point out that the Devil, himself, has many layers. Lucifer does have some redeeming qualities and at times seems to care about others.

What makes this show interesting is that Lucifer is actually trying to ignore his good qualities because he is the Devil. He is supposed to be evil according to his name and what others call him. And being good or having human qualities will only make him question who he really is which is something that scares him since it will push him into an identity crisis. However, the show takes several episodes to get into this deep, introspective aspect of Lucifer and doesn't make it too apparent what Lucifer's true inner- struggle actually is.
