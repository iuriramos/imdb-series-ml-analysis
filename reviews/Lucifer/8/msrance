Pros. 1. Weekly crime solving detective story - if its your thing. 2. The British accent and the everyday personalities of the characters. 3. No attempt at giving any religious undertones (I'm 5 episodes through) 4. The Devil is not trying to hide his identity, so a lot of difficult explanations are out of the way. The issue with immortality becomes a lighthearted moot point, unlike Forever and similar story lines. 5. Has a charm, no application of brains required - just enjoy the show. Cons. 1. The rules of the game keep changing. The basic premise of the story is not true to its own made-up set of rules at times. 2. Personality of Lucifer and other frequent characters does not build up linearly. 3. Not the greatest production values. Result. You've seen a dozen similar shows before, but if a detective crime solving storyline is your thing, then it is really worth a watch. Gives a nice twist to the oft repeated tales.
