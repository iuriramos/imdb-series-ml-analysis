First when i heard about this show I didn't really know what to think about the story of Lucifer (the devil) who is taking a vacation from hell and ended up in Los Angeles helping a police detective solving cases.

But so far this show has been one of the most interesting shows I've ever seen. It has it all, funny and interesting characters and a pretty carefully considered and formed story to go with it.

The show contains a perfect mix of comedy, crime and fantasy, sometimes even a hint of romance. I would definitely recommend watching this show and its totally worth its 8 stars out of 10.
