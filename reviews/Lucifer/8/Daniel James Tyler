This television series is entertaining, and full of intrigue, yet it is misleading. Tom Ellis is almost perfect for the part of Azazel (fallen angel) since the "beast" out of Revelation 13 is British, yet will have roots in Israel. Though, this character that Tom Ellis portrays has been written by misleading writers. Yes, I know that some of this series is supposed to be "funny", but the Devil is not in Hell - he is busy trying to send people TOO HELL.. That is his goal. Also, the devil does not care about solving crime, though, he may meddle in it so that the wrong people get sent of the river so-to-speak. This show is interesting, yet the writers need to give the show more depth, as it is already serialized. Also, in this show Tom Ellis, aka, "the devil" is surrounded by beautiful women, and he seems to want to have sex with all of them.. but the real devil likes his sex violent, and he will have sex WITH ANYONE.. not just 'beautiful women'.. I gave this how an 8, as it has the potential to grow with plots. As a spiritual person I am, most of my colleagues thought I was nuts giving this show any high ratings whatsoever..
