Why are people taking this so seriously - I love this show and cannot stop watching it over and over again for several reasons: it makes me laugh out loud, it has some interesting views on the bible and I very much enjoy Tom Ellis portrayal of Lucifer. One doesn't have to a accept the fact that the devil seems to actually maybe be a nice guy or that he seems to enjoy procedural cop shows but one has to appreciate the one-liners, the witty way to include some fun facts and tidbits, the excellent craftsmanship and the slow but steady built of the characters and the story. I would hate it if this shows potential (that certainly isn't really fulfilled but the last episode, wingman, definitely showed me that it can do at least my expectations justice) goes to waste because some people take fiction too serious and don't understand what "Lucifer" could be about. But I certainly hope that if the US won't make a 2nd season the BBC takes up the story and Tom Ellis and renew it with an even darker sense of humor.
