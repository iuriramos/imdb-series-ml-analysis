Yes, it's the clich√© match up of beautiful cop and supernatural being to solve murders, but it works. Lucifer is full of sass and charm, playing the rebellious son of the Almighty. And Chloe is too hot looking to be a cop, yet doesn't come off as too cheesy. She's likable.

I'm interested to see how the storyline will play out, especially with some of the other characters like the threatening and brooding angel brother that visits Lucifer demanding he return to Hell. I'm especially interested in the hot demoness minion that bar tends for Lucifer's club. And Chloe's cute kid and Lucifer interaction has comic potential, I think. Let's just hope it doesn't go the way of just solving murders every episode because that's going to get old quick. The plot line needs to be focused on something else major. The show can be quite good.
