As a big fan of the comics I was very disappointment to hear that the TV adaptation was going to do away with pretty much everything I liked in the comics in favor of... Another cop show.

But... It grew on me, you know? Despite using the cliché murder mysteries as a framing device, the focus is still on the Lucifer's shenanigans and relationships, what makes for a show that is very funny and refreshing. Though most of it feels like an endless party, there are even some genuine emotional moments here and there. Even the clichéd cop mysteries is done competently, if not greatly. 

To be honest, I never expect great things from this show when it comes up, but I do expect to have one hell of a good time. Pun intended.
