Good story! Flawless acting! Highly entertaining!

The only thing that needs a bit of work is the camera-work. Delivering a line while the faces of the interlocutors are totally obscured by their passage in front of the camera is a rookie mistake. Ah, and one other thing: Why is Lucifer so obviously scared (?) of the archangelÂ…? It makes him less cool! If these 2 things would be taken care of, it would certainly be a 9. Adding some more philosophy to it, or making the main character more devious (or a combination), would definitely bring it to a 10.

All in all, when this comes out, I'll be the first to watch it!
