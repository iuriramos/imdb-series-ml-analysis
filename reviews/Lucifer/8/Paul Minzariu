I'm actually surprised by this TV series.

I didn't expect much out of it before it came out , thought it was gonna be some low-tier rubbish , but it positively surprised me.

It's quite refreshing and it has a great balance between an original and unique story mixed with some nice one-liners which are actually rare these days since you usually see forced humor. This one has a nice feeling to it , really natural and spontaneous.

Great series judging by the first episode , hope it will continue being this way and hope the story will get more and more intriguing as it follows.

Can't wait to see the next episodes(the 2nd comes out tomorrow as well!) , this might be one of the best series this year.
