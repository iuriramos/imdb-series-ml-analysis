When I first started watching the series, I must admit it was out of curiosity as there were controversies when it was initially aired. I mean, I was wondering how they could possibly make a hero out of "Lucifer" who's BAD NEWS, right? Well, the first season didn't impress much. It was entertaining to a certain degree without any offensive indications to less fanatically religious sectors, from my point of view. They didn't make him your every day hero but ironically despite Lucifer having selfish intentions & ideologies his non-heroic acts turn out to be quite the heroics! The intensity & chemistry between the actors have improved tremendously in Season 2 and the script has definitely improved! Watch this without skepticism and you'll probably enjoy a light hearted action, crime series and remember, this a metaphorically intended show!
