Without going into to much detail, I stumbled across the leaked pilot, ad gave it a shot, to my surprise, by the end of the episode my jaw was hurting from a constant smile/laugh throughout the duration of the episode. I really enjoy Tom Ellis as Satan, has a sophisticated sense of humour mixed with just enough whit and sassiness to him, whilst the supporting cast were slightly underwhelming, I believe they can hold their own if the story is directed in the right way.

Whilst some moments of the episode were "Mixed for opinions." I did overall really enjoy this, and I am looking forward to continuing watching Lucifer once the official Season starts in September. 

Overall Rating - 8/10
