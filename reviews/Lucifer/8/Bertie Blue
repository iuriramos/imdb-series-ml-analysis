I thought the show was a hoot - Lucifer shows his imperfection even with his suave, sophisticated accent, he manages to mispronounce Mischievous as 'Mischievious'. It's funny how he actually calls himself Lucifer - I wonder if the name will catch on in the baby naming books - hopefully not. I must admit, when I first saw the title, I was not too sure I liked the idea but in reality - it's a bit of fun, not to be taken too seriously. There's a definite chemistry between Lucifer and his female cop associate but she knows how to handle him well. I think it's an OK show, so far. I guess the next episodes of the series will show if it's a keeper.
