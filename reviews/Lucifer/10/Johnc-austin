Becoming increasingly house bound due to age and physical restraints, I find I am watching more TV than I used to. Series come, series go and most are tolerable, but then up pops Lucifer. Excellent casting and engaging plots with just enough humour, intensity and style, Lucifer steps it up a gear or two. The premise of the devil sending his son down (or up) to earth is probably not new but the humanising is. Excuse the pun but the devil is in the detail of casting. I struggled to think who could fill the lead role better and came up with possibly Richard Armitage, after that zilch. I rarely wait with so much anticipation for the next episode(with the exception of Game of Thrones) and hope the writers don't run out of steam. Long may Lucifer reign over us.
