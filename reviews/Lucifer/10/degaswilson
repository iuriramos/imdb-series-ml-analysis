I think this is show is wonderful.

I just hate that after waiting for the season premiere to come and then watching the episode. The "mum" everyone has been talking about did not show up until the final seconds.

And then I hear "Coming up in 2 Weeks".

W T F!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What is happening with Hollywood. They are not making enough episodes to fill a whole season. What can possibly come on in the place of this show, that could be so important. NOTHING.

I just don't understand the reason behind waiting to continue to "mum" story-line. I can understand the anticipation of it...... but this is the first and second episode of a new season.

What's is going on.
