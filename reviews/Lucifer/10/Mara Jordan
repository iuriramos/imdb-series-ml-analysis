I found this TV Show by accident. I didn't even realise this had been released.

I watched this with a friend, and we both had low expectations of what it would be like. To be honest our expectations were probably based off the fact that we didn't know what it would be about. 

Within seconds (not minutes) we knew we were going to love it. "Lucifer" is smart, handsome, and witty. His humor is attractive, sarcastic and intelligent. Certainly not someone who will disappoint. 

It's easier to tell there will be strong story lines with this character, and they've certainly picked the perfect person for the role. 

If you want to watch something that will have you smiling, laughing out loud and keeps you intrigued this TV show is for you. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys supernatural shows. But, given the strong characters it would be hard for someone who doesn't necessarily like supernatural shows to dislike it.
