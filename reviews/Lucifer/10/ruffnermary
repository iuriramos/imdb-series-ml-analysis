Everyone hating on Lucifer not being satanic or evil enough are missing the point. The devil character in this show has been completely reinvented. He's the naughty rebellious son who has a bad reputation. In the context of this show, people's beliefs about "the devil" are false and superstitious. Lucifer is clearly annoyed by all the false assumptions. I love the clever writing. Lucifer admits openly his true identity, and everyone just thinks he's talking in metaphors or exaggerating. When he speaks of daddy issues people assume he's talking about a human dad so they blow off the fact that he just called his dad "God." All his self-centered inappropriate social behavior reminds me of Steve Carrell's character on the office. Good comedy. It's hilarious.
