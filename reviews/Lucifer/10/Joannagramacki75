Basically when any new show starts on Fox, etc, with a story line where a cop joins up with someone to solve crime- I do an automatic YAWN. This is so played out it's not even funny. BUT Lucifer seemed interesting since it had the heaven/hell aspect added to it. I was SUPER happy with the outcome-It's actually really funny and the pilot was one of the best I've seen in a LONG while. I'm definitely a harsh critic when it comes to TV (I've watched countless shows with a supernatural aspect), and this one stands out. PLEASE keep it on the air. It's funny,episodes are interesting from start to finish, none of the characters annoy me, and there's just the right amount of supernatural to keep you interested without being over the top.
