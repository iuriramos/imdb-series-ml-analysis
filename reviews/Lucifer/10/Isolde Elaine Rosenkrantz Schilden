Oh my God- this one is sooo good I can't express it in words. Amazing work. Seriously. It's fun yet it's serious, it's interesting, the story line is catching and involving. It's like funnier brother of well known CSI series. I personally love CSI Miami, so I think that Lucifer should be very good new thing to try for those who are in love with CSI but at the same time would love a little bit more spice in it- having Lucifer as a human- detective is exactly what that teaspoon of spice is here. It's amazing. Love this show and I'm so glad that it was confirmed for second season (and at the same time I hope that second won't be the last one). Ugh. Definitely gonna watch it.
