Lucifer is one of my favorite series. I love it because it destroys prejudices and because it is very tense. Dialogue between "devil" and people is hilarious and full of sarcasm. And it is very entertaining that Chloe still has no idea who is actually Lucifer even though it is under her nose. It is also intriguing that Lucifer can not "read" Chloe as all other people (it seems that Chloe has a surprise for us and for Lucifer) Although the story is about the devil we have the ability to see his bright side of Lucifer. The only bad thing is that the series only comes out once a week

And I would be angry if this series was canceled Like very angry :D
