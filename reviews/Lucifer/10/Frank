This show is wicked good, it makes me laugh and just allows me to relax and have fun. 

I love the premise that the Devil went on vacation and that he feels tormented by what he has had to endure. 

I also like that he likes to help people, and that he stays around the cop even though she makes him vulnerable "mortal" at times.

It's an interesting premise & I hope that it gets renewed passed season two so that I can continue to enjoy it.

I like that they have now thrown his Mother into the mix and that they're both upset with "Dear old Dad" or God.

It humanizes the characters and makes them relate-able.

People need not take this so seriously, its just a feel good show and I really like the thought process of the characters especially how straightforward Lucifer is about being the Devil.

People often just think he is kidding, until often to late they realize that he was telling the truth.

Life is anecdotal like that, if you believe something. Perhaps you should live it...
