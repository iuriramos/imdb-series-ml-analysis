Born a catholic, became an atheist I really love this series. Satan is great and as every human should know, if he exists... he really likes people. This is what the series is about. A happy amusement show with no pretense to be too intellectual. Voicing to not air this series because of religious reasons only ads to the stupidity of religious Americans as we see them in Europe.

The lead actor does a fine job. David Tennant.. eat your hearth out. Superior sarcasm without being sarcastic. How about that. Absolutely as you can expect from an English actor. Great speech. Beautiful spoken language.
