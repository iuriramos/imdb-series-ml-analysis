So I suppose I'll begin by explaining this: I've actually never written a review or rated anything on IMDb, though have been using the site for as long as I can remember. Then I came by Lucifer. As he does in the pilot, I felt compelled to create an account just to write this and give this show the rating I feel it deserves!

What can I say? I love the whole atmosphere of the show. I love how I feel excitement waiting to see whats going to happen next. I love the strange personalities, contrasting and complementing each other superbly. And I love how Lucifer is different to anything else! Haha :D There's a suave flow that wisps around along with the banterful humour that continuously provides you with smiles and laughs. Though also mixes themes in a very good way. I especially found the whole take on Lucifer extremely intriguing and as I watch, it feels like a joy to travel with the character throughout. It's like you always want to see whats going to happen next or what he'll do. I found all the other characters a joy too. Especially his female partner, a pairing I really enjoyed watching and can't wait to see more!

I don't want to make this too long but all I can say is that Lucifer is a much, much needed breath of fresh air. It strikes me as so different in the notion that it takes this strange idea but hits the nail on the head perfectly. You've no idea what to expect but it becomes a very pleasant surprise. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed it. The Atmosphere, the cast, the characters, the soundtrack and the whole direction they are taking it in. Definitely my sort of show :) I can't wait to see more and I hope the show does well. I would hate to see it go!
