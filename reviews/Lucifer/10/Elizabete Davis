I am a big fan of Neil Gaiman, and I read the Lucifer books beautifully created by Mike Carey, so I was excited and afraid when I learned that a TV series was being created, I started imagining Lucifer with blond hair and beautiful like in the books, I got little disappointed when I saw that they cast Tom Ellis as Lucifer, but my doubts were over when I saw his performance, he nailed Lucifer, he is great and I love his interactions with humans, I understood the series creators to deviate a little from the books but the stories are working fine, I am really glad that Fox decided to renew for season two, Lucifer deserves to be watched by the people who read the books and enjoyed the beautiful stories of redemption and lost souls along with the graphics, and now we can watch Tom Ellis to bring it to life, great job everyone and I hope I can watch this series for many years. Brilliant.
