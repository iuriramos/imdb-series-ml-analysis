When I saw who was in this I decided to give it a chance. Now I am so glad I did because this very well might be my favourite TV show. The cast, in my opinion, is perfect and the music that was used fit so well. Seeing Tom Ellis play a character so different from Gary Preston (Miranda)and pulling it off so brilliantly excites me more than I can say. I was hooked from the beginning to the end. It's odd to say this but.... I love Lucifer. I never imagined that Tom Ellis could actually take such a well known (and hated)character and make it lovable. I am looking forward to see where this show goes and I hope that it'll continue to be as amazing in later episodes as it was in the first.
