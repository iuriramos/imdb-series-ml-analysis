Excellent TV Show that teaches us "How NOT to be JUST black and white" . There are always gray parts that we do not wanna see in life. We tend to blame others for our own mistakes. It's not about religion. It is about the choices we make everyday, it is about the responsibility we take/don't take for our actions. 

Tom Ellis is an incredible actor! I think playing Lucifer so well in this show made me re-think the general concept of all this characters who play a role in our lives. 

All the cast is great! Thanks to the whole crew for creating this show! :) LOVE IT!!!
