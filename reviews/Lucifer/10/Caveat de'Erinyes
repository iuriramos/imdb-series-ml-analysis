First off, I am not a comic reader, and I am coming at this with no preconceptions or bias for or against any previous works on this story line. This said, everyone knows that conversion from written/graphical works to screen (being TV or Movie) often leaves followers of such works disappointed that they have strayed from the "original" story (just keep in mind that this seems to be the case here).

Overall, this pilot looks to be the best new concept show in it's class for quite a while. Great comedy, refreshing characters, and a nice twist-break from the classic "Good vs Evil" stories.

The plot is interesting, if just a tad predictable, but no so much as to put me out on it. The balance of character development is just enough to raise some questions in the viewers mind as to how certain characters revealed in the pilot will mature as the show progresses, but not too much as to over saturate the characters.

The pilot story leaves future story development wide open, with hints here and there to certain plot keys that may or may not be addressed in the first season. 

IMHO, this show is much less controversial than the organization(s)" seeking to block it, and I for one am wishing this team the best of luck with their new series.
