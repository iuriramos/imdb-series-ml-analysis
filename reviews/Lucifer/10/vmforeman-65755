Do you know how many movies are out there that do no justice to the actual written works that they are based off of? And yet people still love them! Why can't people just enjoy something without having to base it off of something else? If it bothers you that much, I'm sorry. But if everyone boycotted a show or move simply because it didn't follow the same pattern as the book, comic, or graphic novel that the idea came from, no one would be enjoying anything out in theaters or on TV now. Recycling old ideas is the name of the game in todays industry. But, if the writer and creator are good enough, they can create a new spin on old news that can be just as good. That is, if people can just give it a chance. This show is funny, sexy and all around entertaining. So just sit back and enjoy the ride for the new show as it is. I hope this stays on the air long enough for me to actually get to enjoy it. I love Supernatural, and this is awesome too!
