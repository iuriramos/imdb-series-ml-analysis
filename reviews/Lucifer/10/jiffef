A lovely put together series with great music. How would not appreciate a little of the devils own blues blended together with the attitude and accent for Lucifer Morningstar. A very great choice by the crew behind this. 

As a fellow comic reader this was a very welcome addition to the series scene. Now all I want is another one with Deadpool and I would be all set. 

All in all, I find my self waiting for the next available episode of smooth jokes with a touch of supernatural undertone. I hope for several seasons.
