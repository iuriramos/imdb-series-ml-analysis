I've read how this show glorifies The Devil and seen the petitions to have it stopped and some overly religious people and reviewers trying to get it a bad rep before it even starts. I've seen a few people who are hard core Comic readers who are not happy about the changes that have been made but i thoroughly enjoyed it. I absolutely loved this new and exciting adaption of Lucifer. It was smart and slick with strong character leads and witty humor.

It was a good strong start with the ground work and a good intro into the characters, it left me with a desire to carry on watching and watch it in turn thrive!
