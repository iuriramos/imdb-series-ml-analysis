i am a catholic but i still want the watch the series. as a Christian it does not mean that i am worshiping Lucifer or anything like that, its an entertainment thing, its just a fictional movie/series that a person made up, if people find offense and or actually believe in this stuff then they have no right being Christians. my faith in God will not be wavered, for the lord knows my heart. besides, this story shows a some what good side of this fictional Lucifer, don't we all wish that he turned good anyway? and also i personally want to know who this girl really is, wouldn't it be great if she's actually an archangel?? i mean come on people this series has the potential to be awesome, because it is different.
