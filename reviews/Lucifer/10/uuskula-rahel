The show is something everyone should give a try. Tom Ellis is extremely charming and absolutely perfect for the role and Lauren German is amazing also. The chemistry between them is perfect and I can't wait to see what grows(or doesn't) of them. Lesley-Ann Brandt is perfect for the role of Mazikeen, she is mysterious and also like an open book at the same time. The show is full of funny moments and after watching it you are never left feeling bad or sad. It's the perfect show for Monday nights as everyone needs to relax and take their mind off the first day of work after the weekend. It's also great for binge-watching. The only bad thing about this show is that when the episode finishes you are left needing more. You just can't get enough of it, thats how good it is. A lot of people are complaining that it is not like it was in the comic books, but I think that regardless of that it is great. The comics were good the show is good, what is there too complain about? Nothing. It is pure perfection. Like it was sent down form heaven :)
