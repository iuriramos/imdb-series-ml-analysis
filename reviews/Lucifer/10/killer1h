A phenomenal show with none other then Tom Ellis(Rush)and wouldn't you know it, they didn't even have him change character. Sure this version of him is much more put together and not falling apart but then again in this show he's very literally the devil.

So here's how the story goes so far, Lucifer(Tom) decided that he was sick of hell and took a well deserved retirement to earth, whilst here he's enjoying toying with people which is his very special super power, you know, getting people to reveal their deepest and darkest desires. He meets Chloe(Lauren German) who's a cop but is oddly immune to his powers. In the midst of being intrigued and entertained they both seem to play off each others company quite well and solve crimes.

A interesting twist on an old idea, it works in this case I give a 10/10 for a wildly entertaining and roaring good start.
