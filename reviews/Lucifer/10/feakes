Interesting but highly unlikely premise based on Neil Gaiman's SANDMAN in which Lucifer decides to move to L.A. and give up his throne in Hell. throwing the natural balance of things out of order. Worst Yet after a girl dies in his arms a victim of a drive by shooting The Devil decides to play Avenger. He becomes smitten with the female detective in charge of the case. This fascination leads him into further investigations with her .Even if she ants his help or not. Lucifer owns and runs a nightclub along with his bodyguard Maze Lucifer has a Arc angel from Heaven telling him he must go back to Hell to maintain the balance of things. the Devil on the other hand refuses he is having too much fun dealing out Justice and punishing the Guilty. not to mention the Female Cop who seems to have captured his libido if not his heart.

A Fun premise but a highly unlikely one. As fun as this series is I find it difficult to accept the premise Of The Devil leaving Hell to become a "Good Guy" when the Devil as we know him is full of hate and rage add to the fact that he despises us with a vengeance and cannot wait to destroy us.The Real Life Devil always comes to mind and takes away the enjoyment of the show. As A Fluff piece its worth a bag of popcorn to sit back and watch it and enjoy it. Its not a serious Show by any means so put your brain on hold your beliefs in neutral for a bit and watch. As Far as Entertainment goes it does its job. And it does it well.
