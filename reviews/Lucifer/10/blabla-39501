I just don't get one thing. People who say this show glorify Satan. What portraying Satan as a good guy get on your nerves. I mean the show doesn't have any rituals as supernatural, but still that show is on season 11 and it rocks. Sure there are some episodes that didn't reach our expectations but didn't affect the show. And why all these petitions to stop airing lucifer, some because the devil is portrayed as a good guy, and some because it's different that the comics??? I read the comics and it's cool to have a Hollywood twist. Don't like stick to the comics and whatever show you watch. The cast have great chemistry and especially Tom Ellis and Lauren German. All and all watch the show. It's hilarious and doesn't insult anything. Stop being oversensitive about TV shows they're made so we have a good time and laugh after a long day. Hope this show is renewed.
