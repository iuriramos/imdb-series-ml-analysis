This show is absolutely FABULOUS. I loved it so much that this is my first ever review on this site. Tom Ellis is charisma personified. I was grinning watching him for the whole episode. Terrific writing and hilarious one-liners. Best TV experience I've had in years.

I was hooked the minute I heard the opening music and saw his mischievous grin when the cop was pulling him over. Lucifer delivers his lines with the perfect tones and facial expressions. Everything from sticking it to Amenadiel when requested to return to Hell to his banter with Chloe's daughter when she's in trouble at school. I almost choked laughing when he enters 2 Vile's home telling them to turn off the "God awful" music.

I watched it twice to make sure I caught all of the dialogue =)
