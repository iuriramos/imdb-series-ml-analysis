All I can say is this series is the best program I've watched for a very long time. It's really funny, really addictive and quite unlike anything I've ever seen.

The actors are outstanding and the plot is really well written. I hope so much that there is a series 2.

I really like the idea of having the devil himself on earth and as he slowly becomes more mortal and has doubt about who he is and what his purpose is, the plot becomes ever more exciting as we see his contradictory need to punish collide with his fight for justice.

I never thought Amazon prime would be as good as sky for series but this definitely makes it worth the prime cost by itself!
