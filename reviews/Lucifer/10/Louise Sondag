A series that has the advantage of being original! And it is a very good point. And I can tell you it is for me one of the best series that I've looked! Each episode is purely good shot and very well thought out. And actors! They embody their characters to perfection! Especially Tom Ellis with a game that is stunning, her accent, her head etc etc fits exactly with the characters of Lucifer! Lucifer and Chloe are both very different and very endearing. The spontaneity of Lucifer makes the series even better, it is shocking and hilarious. Finally a great series as it is rare to see! I strongly advise.
