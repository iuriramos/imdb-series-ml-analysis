i loved this first episode which in my experience is a bad thing because the shows i love get canceled. But as a television version or a graphic novel 'Lucifer' is faithful but still a television show hunting for ratings. i mean no ratings mean not more seasons (i'm looking at you Constantine) so i understand the problem with converting a much loved VERTIGO product into a television 'product' Starting to wonder if any of them can make it. Personally i want a film/TV version of Sandman but when Hellblazer bombs (even though i liked it) and the reviews so far for Lucifer Morningstar haven't been great then i'm not holding my breath. i'd rather have a mind-blowing Sandman than a so-so, canceled before the first season has even even ended Sandman.
