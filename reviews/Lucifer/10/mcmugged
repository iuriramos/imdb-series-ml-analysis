I was hooked from episode 1. Have seen 4 episodes and they are getting better and better. I love that Lucifer (the devil) is so charming and funny. He isn't trying to trick people into doing evil, but those who do, he wants to punish. When he meets a female detective who is not affected by his hypnosis or sexual appeal, he wants to know why. The detective's little girl just loves Lucifer for some reason. Whenever she sees him, she runs over and hugs him. This always surprises him and he doesn't know how to handle it. He seems to be at a loss around children and in one seen throws a toy and tells the little girl to go fetch it.

For Lucifer, being in L.A. instead of Hell is a new, fun experience. He was bored in Hell. 

Lucifer admits freely that he is the devil, but of course, most people don't take that literally. Little by little the detective starts to wonder what he is after she sees unexplainable things. 

I am so glad this isn't one of those apocalyptic stories where good versus evil is battling. So far, this is just a fun, entertaining show with a little bit of supernatural stuff going on.

I wish this show was on Netflix so I could binge-watch right now!
