When I've first saw the trailer for Lucifer I thought how will it be cool. To be honest, each episode made me feel more empathy for the devil. Sure, there are some misunderstandings, but I totally dig the whole movie. From the very start, you can meet the devil, walk by his side and see the world through his eyes. Even the other characters, even though I hope they will develop much more in the second season. For now, I may say, this is one of the most interesting TV shows. You will love the idea of ''modern devil''. Beside that, some of the characters are pretty nasty - and it's not Lucifer's fault. It will totally change your view on Lucifer.
