Up until now Satan has /always/ been written as a chaotic sociopath hellbent on murder, gore, etc.

People forget, Lucifer was an angel. People forget, Lucifer was the angel whose sin was PRIDE. Not murder and mayhem. He was written as a character that stood against God because he thought he could control his own destiny and that he compared TO god. Wouldn't it stand to reason that in many ways that would make him MORE like god in his love and treatment of others and less of the sociopath that he is always depicted as?

There is a line in the series that stood out significantly to me, about the nature of redemption for anyone if there is even one person that can't be redeemed.

This new take on Satan is beautiful. His pride about who he is and what he is capable of with his angelic tendencies showing through. The underlying story is one of what it means to have free will and love.

Everything about this crime drama is hilariously and cleverly written. Satan refuses to follow the rules of man (why should he), but sort of humors those around him out of curiosity to see what the humans do next to punish the wicked through legal channels.

I highly recommend this show for everyone. I hope to see great things from it.
