Complete fantasy. Absolutely love this series. I look forward to every Monday just to watch. 

I can perfectly see the temptation in this devil, and the beguiling character. Hitched up with humor the combination of the dark side mixed with the light side is an intriguing concept. The writers are great with the one-liners and Chloe is the perfect straight man. They make a great team. I'm really looking forward to more episodes. Captivated with the concept of angels and devils walking amongst us for devious purposes. So many directions to take this story line. 

Its simply great entertainment. Tom Ellis is the perfect actor to portray the devil. He makes the show.
