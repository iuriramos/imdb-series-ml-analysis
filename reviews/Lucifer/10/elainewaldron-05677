I love this show! I just hope they don't make Lucifer too much of a weakling, as seems to be the going trend these days with heroes and superheroes. I love the wit! The acting is great. Still, the writers need to keep Lucifer a little dangerous. Otherwise, they are going to ruin a very good show. I am not the only fan of this show who feels this way. Don't ruin it! Keep Lucifer a little scary. Please!

The first show was awesome. The second and third still good, but now it is going downhill a bit. Please bring Lucifer back to a somewhat scary fellow. I fully intend to keep watching it, though, as long as it is own, as the theme is refreshing. So far, as I said, I love it!
