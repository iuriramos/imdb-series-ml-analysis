Until Lucifer, Tom Ellis was unknown to me, but I instantly became a fan. I'm not a comic book fan, so I had no expectations on how the character would turn out. I went into the show with no prior knowledge and now I couldn't picture anyone else playing that role.

He's such a witty and charming character, but also selfish. I love how they combined these traits and still makes you love him. People are throwing titles like "righteous" and "kind" to explain him, but I think there misjudging his intentions.

On first glance you get the buddy cop feel with a twist. Something like Castle or Elementary. It is taking this route, but it is just a small part of the over all story.

I cant end this review without talking about the comedy side of the show. By no means is it a comedy, but Lucifer's one liners will keep you entertained. Hes full of witty jokes and stories that he pulls out, sometimes at the worst point possible. Which just makes it all the more funny.
