Just finished the last episode of season 1 online! Every time that I finished watching an aired episode I kept waiting for the next one. This series is simply excellent for my taste. The devil's character is seen as being a charming and well-dressed gentleman in his mid thirties with excellent taste who finds pleasure in not only punishing the bad, but also helping the good which actually makes more sense. Everything has to be balanced and someone needs to be the bad guy so that humans can have the gift of free will and choose what is right themselves. 

The cast in this series is perfect and the acting is convincing. The music is very good and I already downloaded some songs :) Willing to buy the whole soundtrack but waiting until season 2 is out as well so that I can buy both together! 

As for the ones who are saying bad things about what the series represents, I say that hey they are entitled to their own opinion, however seriously! there are so many movies and series out there having Lucifer in their scenarios as well - Look at Supernatural, Constantine, Lion Heart, the devil's advocate and so much more! and yet only this show gets so much criticism ... not fair really!

I seriously commend the script writers, actors and producers and thank them for bringing 40 minutes of fun in my routine!!

I will be really looking forward to see season 2!!!
