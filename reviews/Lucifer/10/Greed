For anyone to go into this without any preconceived notions will find this to be ridiculously entertaining. If your looking for the lulz you won't find them as some of them are subtle and to focus entirely on that can make the true intent of the screenplay and the thrill of story telling pointless. 

The whole point of Lucifer's character is shrouded in a mysterious persona and from that angle add in a volatile tongue and quick witted remarks and intellectual humor makes this mind boggling series amusing.

Pretend the character is like a stone in an ocean. And Lucifer's whole perception of his take on his interests is him fancifully skipping rocks so it always hits the stone in the seemingless endless ocean. He knows his stuff and isn't afraid to protrude into the minds of people as this gives him benefit of the doubt whenever he finds himself in situations that require little to no thinking.

Lucifer just knows and thats the antenna to the satellite that people don't connect. The trick is to watch this series while you experience life and how it really does tell a realm of possibility that exists and has been taken out of from. 

I mean Lucifer? The heavenly beautiful angel that takes a vacation to the human world? And he has made "friends" with a female? Who knows what strange things lay await in this series.

I don't really write reviews as this is my first review and I hope saying little makes sense instead of revealing a lot of what I believe to be the legitimacy of a movie.
