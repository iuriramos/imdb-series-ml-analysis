Tom Ellis -the perfect casting for this part. He equally attracts and repulses, as one would assume of a Lucifer. It is hard not to keep staring. His eyes, just slightly off- enough to register oddness and keep one intrigued. The show is a fun, light, and a humorous adult way of addressing a controversial topic, bringing it into the mainstream. I am admittedly not a fan of the comic, so I am not challenged with the preconceived prejudices that can cause angst for some watchers. That said, art is interpretive and one form should not try to reproduce another, but should interpret - and be taken at it's own face value. The show has kept us watching, and looking forward to watching each week, and THAT is the thing. The characters are developing and becoming more and more faceted each week, which is what good storytelling should be. We are anticipating the next season- loved the cliff hanger at the end of this one.
