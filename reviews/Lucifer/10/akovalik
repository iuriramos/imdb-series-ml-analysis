I LOVE this show !! It has become my favourite TV show ! I look forward to Monday to watch Lucifer. The casting is brilliant. It is clever & witty. There are times I actually laugh out loud ! And Lucifer is devilishly delicious !!! (sorry) Lol He is arrogant but you love him. It's all about him but you love him. This show is like a breath of fresh air because it is so different. The psychiatrist lady is perfectly cast. And how they ever found such a perfect person to play Lucifer is amazing to me. Thank you to the creators of this show for bringing us a TV show that is exciting to watch. There are times I have to rewind just to hear some things over again because I am laughing so hard or because I am going "did he just say....?" It is a drama but with a cutting,funny edge.I absolutely love this show. Haven't been so excited about a TV show in a long time.
