I'm a huge fan of the show supernatural, and how dark that show can get. Along with all the crime shows. When I began to watch this show and saw how different their Lucifer was I fell in love with him.

This Lucifer is a fresh breath of air. There hasn't been any like him before. The way he is so free and easy going than within seconds can embrace his dark side is wonderful. And you never know when that will happen.

And its great how he has lived among humans for several years, watched them, even made deals with them yet still doesn't understand them. And how he tries to understand why they act the way they do and why he starts to act the same way. He is like a lost kitten in the city, especially since when someone tells him what is wrong and he refuses to believe it. Cause that type of thing "Just cannot happen to the devil".

He is the best devil, I have seen. Funny, serious, and of course evil when it counts.
