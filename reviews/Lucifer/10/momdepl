(spoiler ahead) I absolutely love the show. I totally recommend it to people who are into supernatural (demon & god kinda thing) and crime frighting,then this is the show for you. I personally like supernatural and i liked crinimal minds and when i saw the first episode i really enjoyed it. I love all the mysteries and thrill through out the show and i love the protagonist ideal and how some things change through the show. I love how lucifers plays with inmortality at the beginning and mortality at the end. I cannot wait until the next episode Monday of the 7th. And in my honest opinion i have been a walking dead fan since the very 1st episode and i do not believe that zombie will exist in the near future and with this show i do not believe in gods, demons, and angels but in this show i have enjoyed how it was created. I know the basics of how the immortal works but i love how lucifer wants to expirence even mortality
