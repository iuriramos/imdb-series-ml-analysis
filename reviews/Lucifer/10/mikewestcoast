I really like this TV show. I like the fact that Lucifer calls a spade a spade, is an extremely honest person (most of the time), he doesn't lie about who he really is, he hates it when humans lie, he keeps his word, he enjoys punishing bad people and I like his superpowers. 

I also enjoy finding out about any new superpowers that Lucifer has as the show unfolds. I also like the fact that he chose Los Angeles to live because I like Los Angeles and it would be a great city to live in (if one was actually Satan or not Satan) and that he wants to help solve crimes with a Los Angeles police detective. 

At the end of the very first episode, he realizes he wants to seek professional psychological help since he would like to learn more about himself. I like that he is seeking help for this, even though one would think since he's lived many years (Billions of years? Not sure.) he would have a full understanding of himself; however, much to his own surprise, he is learning new things about himself.

The icing on the cake is that this TV show makes the credulous squirm and get bent out of shape in real life because the show is about Satan himself.
