This is the best pilot i have seen in 2015! it's very smooth and entertaining. The plot seems quite simple and yet very intriguing while the power imbalance between good and evil gives characters a broad spectrum of action. I don't know how much of this show will be based off of the comic books but I hope that the supernatural will be kept to the necessary amount. I am looking forward to discovering the other facets of Lucifer as he tries to be more human.I was very disappointed when Constantine got cancelled so this makes me really impatient to watch the first season and hoping the next episodes will be as entertaining as the pilot was.
