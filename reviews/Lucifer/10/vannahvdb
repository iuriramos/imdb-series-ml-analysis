I was disappointed when Rush ended, and very pleased to see that Tom Ellis would be in a new series. I simply love this show. I expected darkness, but it is so light and humorous, and he plays the part so well, you cant help but fall in love with the fallen angel. His charming, witty, charismatic character really just makes it an awesome show. As another reviewer stated i also found the supporting cast to be somewhat boring, and Lauren German doesn't seem to take a strong lead. I also enjoy the fact that its not the run of the mill "devil is on earth" type of series. As much as you think you would be put off by the name, give it a try! I look forward to future episodes!
