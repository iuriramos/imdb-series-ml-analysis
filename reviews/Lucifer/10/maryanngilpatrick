discovering this show, by word of mouth, was such a joy! a send up of the stuff i had crammed down my throat for way too many years is delightful.

Ellis is very tall and very slender, so he looms without being physically menacing. It doesn't hurt that he is very very nice to look at.

I do think Trixie steals the show.

has anyone mentioned the reference to the silver city, and "You were supposed to be blonde." " I get that a lot."
