Its been a long while since i have come across a unique and well scripted TV series. It has the all the ingredients that make up a good show. Good acting, action, comedy, plot and something that people can relate to in one way or the other. Each episode leaves you with something to thing about and makes you laugh at the same time. Its an interpretation often miss understood because there actually isn't anything to explain or understand, its just a big what if the devil actually did wear "Prada". Its like NCIS without the politics and a darker shade of Super Natural. And now I cant really imagine anyone else playing Lucifer but Tom.
