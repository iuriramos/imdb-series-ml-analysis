The first two or three episodes of this series were just meh for me but the last few episodes were just amazing...It really develops Lucifer as a character and not just as the lord of hell...It shows his vulnerable side and his feelings too...I feel that this series has the potential to be a great one just like the flash...If you remember correctly, then the first few episodes of the flash weren't that good but it really took off after the 10th episode or so...For me, Tom Ellis has been magnificent...He is the reverse flash of this show...The one character that makes you want to watch one more episode...Plus the show doesn't have a lot of cgi and hence looks a lot better that the flash did at this junction...Overall, I feel like the best time to start watching this show is now
