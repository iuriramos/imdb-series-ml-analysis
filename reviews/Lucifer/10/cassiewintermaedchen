I literally can't stop binge watching this series <3 I don't really know what else to say about Lucifer... I love his humor and I like seeing all the Hawaii Five O stars starring in this season. Lori West, Governor Danning Detective, Vincent Fryer and I've seen Josette Parker from the Vampire Diaries and oh Kayla Ewell as well :D I love seeing familiar faces and the show is just awesome... I can't wait for season 2. Definitely gonna keep watching this! How many more lines do I need here? 10 lines seriously? But anyway... ah... since I can't really spoiler anybody here nor do I want to... But I guess it's save to say that I like the kind of "relationship" Chloe and Lucifer have and I like that he can't get shot in the beginning. Makes for some really cool scenes.
