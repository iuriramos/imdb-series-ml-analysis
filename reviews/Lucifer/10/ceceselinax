I love shows that have a horror theme, and it makes a show even better when they combine that with a comedy aspect. Lucifer is something that I came across by chance and ended up adoring. It's so witty and entertaining and it is refreshing as it isn't trying desperately to be like its supernatural drama counterparts. The acting is captivating. Lucifer is such an incredibly well written character and I genuinely don't think they could have done any better with the casting as Tom Ellis truly shines in this role. I also really enjoyed Lauren German's portrayal as Chloe, who is such an honest and confident character. Lucifer just exudes mystery and the humour is fantastic. I cannot wait for further episodes to be released and I sincerely hope they renew it for a second season.
