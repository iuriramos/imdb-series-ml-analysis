Okey guys. This show is going to be awesome! From the very first episode it has some potential and a lot to tell us. It can show us the Devil from the different angle how we don't know him. We can see that there is always something good in the bad. In person or even in some not living thing. Every bad is good for something. 

Keep going guys and make it strong! Hope it will last long (As long as Supernatural! Even longer!). I don't want this show to be cancelled after one season. Hope it will last for a looong loooooong very looooooooooong time! :) Love this show from the pilot episode. Can not wait for January 2016. And also this show has the greatest cast! I think the writers won't disappoint us. Truth to be told I've watched the pilot episode 4 times in a row :D. Just simply this show is awesome :)
