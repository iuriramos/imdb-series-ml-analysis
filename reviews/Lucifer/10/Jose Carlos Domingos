I really can't describe how fantastic this show is. I'm really happy that it got renewed for a second season, because the plot that will be developed in it will be amazing.

When I first read the synopses I wasn't really that enthusiastic, actually I really thought it was ridiculous, the Devil leaving Hell to LA...but just like iZombie, I was wrong, so very wrong, and I love being wrong in this cases. The cast is phenomenal, Tom Ellis was so well cast as well his formidable partner of crime. The plot is simple, which helps in some situations, it doesn't complicate itself with stupids plot twists or something. 

And another thing that I love about this show is the fact that it's so different from other series. Love the storyline, the character development, mainly about Lucifer, that just like us in some occasions is discovering his true-self, trying to understand and make sense of his actions. Believe in my word, you will adore this TV show, and if not, well it's pretty normal, we are a big world and we just can't be all alike.
