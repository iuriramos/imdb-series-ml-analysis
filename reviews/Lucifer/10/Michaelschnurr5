It's a fun show to watch. Love the cast, especially the devil. It looks like there are some things that are going to happen to make him a little deeper, but one of the parts I like is how shallow and self centered Lucifer is. I actually laugh out loud at a lot of the stuff he says and have come to really like his character as he shows a side of regret, redemption, forgiveness and caring as well as retribution and punishment. I've never read or even heard of the comics that other reviews mention so I can't comment on that. Overall one of the most enjoyable new series I've found in awhile and I hope it makes the cut. Geeze I can believe I've got to write another line just to get this in...give me a break.
