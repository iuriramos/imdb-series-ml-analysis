Wow, What a pilot episode!

The pilot has given off a great first impression to what is to come!

As played by Tom Ellis, Lucifer is a light-hearted - and sometimes insufferable - prick with a soft side for fallen angels (of the human variety) and sweet young children. There's not much danger to the character.

Both actors have considerable screen presence but neither are able to fully make their characters anything other than one-dimensional: He's a funny jerk, she's his straight-laced - but not prudish - galpal.

I suppose there is room for Lucifer to grow; it's unfair to judge the show's potential based on just the first episode as it has given me the impression of a clich√© storyline, but this is TV land, where first impressions are crucial and the landscape is always changing in bigger, darker ways.

For all his notoriety, Lucifer has a lot to prove in this playground, but for a pilot episode, it was certainly a refreshing twist!
