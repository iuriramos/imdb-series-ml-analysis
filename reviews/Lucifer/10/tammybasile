I just love this show! I was practically hooked on the previews! Funny, entertaining, and smart as hell. I desperately hope this show makes it many more seasons! Even my husband likes it and he's very hard to please. 

I love that Lucifer tells everyone the truth about who he is and no one believes him. Also, that he doesn't like children, but Chloe's daughter takes to him instantly. I about fell out of my chair when he tries to get her to "fetch" her doll. 

I cannot say how much I enjoy this show! Please keep it coming!

If anyone from Fox reads this, to them I say, "Bravo! Well done! Don't listen to the religious idiots who will hate. Keep doing what your doing." 

The writing is amazing! Keeps me laughing and engaged, wondering what will happen next. This series is an instant winner in my book!
