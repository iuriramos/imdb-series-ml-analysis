Finally a show that shows the devil "Lucifer" as not just some evil in the night waiting to prey on the innocent. But as someone who is here for a reason, to punish those who commit evil acts against other humans. Seeing how Lucifer interacts with and starts to relate to humanity is wonderful. The female lead is brilliantly done. Tough, smart and loving as a single mother as well as a teacher to Lucifer. I love how the people from hell are all effected by Trixie and a child's innocence. I think it will be something to see when Lucifer's brother Amenadiel has his interaction with the child. Patiently awaiting the next episode with their mother escaping from Hell. Does anyone have any idea on when it will air?
