As an atheist, this is an amazing film for me. Lucifer (which if you do your biblical research is a Babylonian king not Satan) has a lot of moral issues he is dealing with.

He came from being the lord and ruler of hell over tormented souls and demons and now he has "fun" punishing people for their crimes. Nothing sadistic, he follows the law. But he is a suave individual you can't help but think is right.

Frankly, Lucifer is a better man then most men. He doesn't use his powers to gain privilege or advantage. He is trying to find another way to punish evil people.

Also as he said "he has no control over sins, that's on humans"

Great Lucifer show.
