I often wonder why nobody looks at religion as the mythology it is. History has always been written by the winners! For once you get to see the other side of the story. Just hope it doesn't turn into a sappy drama in later episodes. So far this witty dialog and interesting story lines has caught my attention, and look forward to every Monday night TV time. When Lucifer Morningstar said "Thank you. Thank you, but lately I've been thinking. Do you think I'm the Devil because I'm inherently evil, or just because dear ol' dad decided I was?" I'm absolutely fascinated by Christianity mythology, and how they as a whole can pass things they do as "The devil made me do it" or "I had a moment of weakness" Just remember 1 simple little fact. The devil doesn't judge you for being human.
