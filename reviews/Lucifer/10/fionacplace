I tend not to write reviews, but I thought this series deserved a write up. It was really good that for a comic book adaption there wasn't a lot of special effects which for me made it more believable. I do feel that networks think anything that supernatural these days must contain tons of sfx I'm glad they didn't do this with Lucifer .There has been a steady progression in the story and it didn't feel rushed. Loved the ending of the series you do definitely have to watch the entire series then reflect on it as some bits you tend to dismiss. I don't think there was any character that felt they didn't belong or needed any more definition, I think the character building throughout was a very steady pace. All in all a very worthwhile show which I can't wait until season 2 is on, finally a program that is worth watching its been a long time since I have actual made time to watch a program.
