Truth be told this show is a refreshing view on the dark thrills of shows with Lucifer out there and it represent Lucifer for what he is really describe, not a lord of darkness but a child who resent his father because he was grounded for talking back to his father, so in more understandable term's a child trowing a tantrum,and to make sure that every idiot out there who like to ruin TV shows for everyone and do not understand lore the great powers and destructive strengths that he suppose to have is because of divine powers that he forsake when he cut off his wings at that moment he should have become humans but because he is the first he keep a lot of his powers but slowly he began to lose them and becoming human and in the process opening himself to human emotions and everything back to what he was before falling from grace, I really do not care if it is not like the comics it is still a great work and a great TV show an something refreshing and fun to watch plot with no emotionally drama that makes people think twice before watching a TV show except for all those emotionally broken people who lost all theirs imagination- this does not include those that suffer a horrible experience or lost someone or suffer a terrible accident- this is for those that are fun and just like to mess everything up.
