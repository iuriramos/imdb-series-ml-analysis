Usually I don't give a review but now I just had to, because this show is seriously amazing! I have waited so long for something like that. I just loved the whole pilot! It was funny, exciting and the actor of Lucifer is just perfect for the role! He was dashing and gorgeous; a man you can't resist! I think this show has a lot of potential and I'm really excited for the episodes that will follow. Also I like the chemistry between Tom Ellis and Lauren German it will be interesting to see where their relationship will go. The show is exactly what I needed: something new, fresh and with a clever and smart dialog! Fantasy, Drama, Comedy a top score for me!
