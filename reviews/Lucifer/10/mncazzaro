For me this TV show is perfect.It's new and fresh.And show us other side of the devil.The first season was really good.I hope that season 2 will be as good as 1 or better. I was fan of supernatural but there is non end show and I am really board of it.Here we see a lot of action which is mixed with a lot of styles - Drama,horror,comedy,crime ... and more which are so good mixed that holds you from the beginning to the end of the every episode.And let me say some words for Tom Ellis or Lucifer ...yeah this actor really love his role.His presence and acting are in new level.From what I read in internet I am agree that he has to be the new agent 007.And let say some words for the soundtrack.Wow speechless every song is perfect for each moment.I don't know how they did it but I like it a lot.And for final give a chance to this show and you will be surprised of it how much interesting it is.
