Thank God, as a Christian It felt weird watching this one, but I see that there is no problem, the the show is hilarious, everything is funny, they way Tom Ellis portray all they evil qualities of the Devil in a funny way is good. They are hiding anything or implying anything, everything is out in the open, they are not hiding they fact that the devil is evil or manipulative as shown in the end of episode 2. At first when I saw this show I pegged it as an occultic show but as I began to watch it more deeply I began to see that the purpose is not to glorify Satan, but it is just to make you laugh your ribs out from the premise to the execution. Lucifer is still pretty much the manipulative scumbag we all know him to be in this show, but in a far more funnier way. Every body in the cast are master comedian especially in the act of sarcastic comedy. Based on my faith I can't encourage you to watch it, it is your choice based from what you read above.
