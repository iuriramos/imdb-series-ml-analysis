Let's start off with the fact that I am not religious at all and I did not read the comic, so I am able to review this title quite objectively. 

Lucifer starts of as a quite exciting detective with a little twist, you won't see your average cop duo with an uninteresting story line. In a way, it is actually a bit similar to the show Sherlock. The main character Lucifer is brilliant, his character makes constant references to heaven/hell/religion on a different and funny manner. The fact that he is the only British person in the show (so far) emphasizes the fact that he is 'different' to say the least. 

Since he is the devil he has some benefits that come with it like being immortal and being able ask for someones deepest desires. These powers, however, have no effect on his partner, a female cop and ex actress. While this idea sounds great, the actress for Chloe could have been played by someone else. Her personality and face are sometimes distracting during intense scenes. 

The main story line is simple, but interesting and enjoyable. I like the fact that they do not put a label on religion, they do not criticize religion nor do they praise it. They do, however, make the occasional jokes with a religious background like when Lucifer is asked whether Lucifer Morningstar is a real name or stage name, Lucifer replies: "God given I'm afraid". It is these kinds of jokes that make the show the brilliant show it is. 

I would like to give this show an 8.5, but I am forced to compensate for the sheer amount of negative reviews for religious reasons.
