I have been underwhelmed by most of the new shows in the past 12 months. Lucifer was a complete and welcome surprise. The interplay of the actors is completely natural for a cast that is new to each other. The casting of Ellis as Lucifer is perfect. Loved the soundtrack opening with Ain't No Rest for the Wicked by Cage the Elephant and finishing with Always Something by the same band. Doesn't hurt he's driving a classic black stingray convertible. I am hooked. So glad it is LA and not Vegas. I hope they can keep up the humor over a season and that it can keep from being patronizing or moralistic (which I suspect many of the negative reviewers would appreciate). Interesting that the spectrum seems to be 8 to 10 stars or 1 to 2. If this show is a 1, please point me to the show on network television that is a 10.
