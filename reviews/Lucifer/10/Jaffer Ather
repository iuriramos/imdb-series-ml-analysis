The best part of this show is that it is contained with lots of twists,turns and excitement.It keeps you focused all the time and curiosity for this show increases time by time.The taste of this will never let you be unsatisfied by it.This show has got lots of potential to stay in competition.

To me this episode (The Monster) by far was the best till date as when Lucifer shows what exactly he is? It was a thrill which literally carried goosebumps on my body when the face of hidden Lucifer is shown. I was tumbled at this moment of time as it was an awestruck moment. Her mother is one suspicious character. One important thing is the characters are slowly and steadily being revealed which indicates there's much more to come.

My Rating for this show is a Total 10 Just waiting for the next episode.
