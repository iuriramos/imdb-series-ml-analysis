I really don't understand the negative reviews of this extremely entertaining TV series. Bad acting? Really? Tom Ellis bad actor? Really? Are we watching the same show? Great entertainment, excellent acting, excellent casting, excellent chemistry between the leads, excellent pacing, and a few more 'excellents' that you'll either appreciate or simply not notice. Just another cop show as someone commented? The 'cops and robbers' is the backdrop theme and just as the 'cowboys and injuns' backdrop was used to convey countless excellent entertaining stories ranging from the truly gritty to the utterly comical, Lucifer succeeds admirably in conveying a fresh and light-hearted comedic drama that obviously uses the 'cops and robbers' theme as a very general backdrop. Incidentally, what is wrong with having another good 'cop' TV show anyway, or another good 'sci-fi' TV show? Or another 'about anything' good new TV show? Heaven knows (pun intended) we have enough bad ones. For me this was one of the best pilots for quite a while; I enjoyed it as much as the new X-Files pilot. Put two pretty much unknown leads into the X-Files and see how it goes down with viewers - I'd guess it'd go pretty badly. Lucifer is a success right from the start with a very fresh understated approach. My guess is that viewers will either love it or hate it and there will be little middle ground. I loved it and it is most definitely on my 'can't wait for the next episode' list but your mileage may vary. As is so rightly said, different strokes and all that.
