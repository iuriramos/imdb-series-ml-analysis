I missed the complete first season and got to season 2 after the first episode. I certainly wish to see more of it. Lucifer has left Hell to come to our world as a detective fighting crime. Now, if that's not a new idea, I don't know what is. And the devil is a good guy after all, and charming to boot. Of course, dealing with God, his mom and his numerous siblings is quite entertaining. I bet he would have a much harder time composing with various religions on Earth. And who would want to bother anyway? Lucifer is a free loader, but one who doesn't care about material goods. He's enjoying himself, dishing out punishments while humans are still alive. That must be quite a change for him. I can't help but wish he came to Washington to punish rotten politicians, but alas, he got hooked by a pretty detective in the City of Angels. One good, honest cop, he watches over. Lucifer is always a bit frantic. God is always on his tail, so to speak, trying to derail his pleasure train by using humans as pawns for is eternal fight against the Dark Prince. Quite a change of perspective and a refreshing one, even if the whole concept is ludicrous. The good devil also speak with a British accent. Somehow, nobody could believe the show would work with an American accent. I guess the Devil works in mysterious ways too. Lucifer is simply the best show I've seen on TV since «Dead Like Me».
