i have to say plot is amazing.

And cast is amazing specially tom Ellis,he is always fun to watch.i saw him first time on rush. although i don't understand why did USA network cancel the show it was crazy fun.

Far from menacing, Lucifer is a magnetic gentleman. He wears nice suits, talks in charming accent and is very manipulative. The way he is displayed here hinges a lot on persuasion. He oozes confident, able to affect others with ease but without being overly callous or arrogant. Tom Ellis just struts as though he embraces the characters, the confidence is nearly infectious.

Well Lucifer is on the great start. nice job with script. great job from director. little room for improvement. but great show which i haven't seen in while on American television. i hope it does great.
