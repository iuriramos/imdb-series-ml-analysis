Tom Ellis was brilliant as the love interest in Miranda - a screwball British comedy - so, check that out for more of him in a comedy role.

He's been an extremely busy actor for the last 15 years but this is the first time he's been let loose on an American audience.

There's nothing particularly original about the premise or the plots... man with a superpower makes everyone around him look like a bloody idiot - but the script and Ellis carry this off so well, that it doesn't matter.

The only danger is will it run out of steam? Will the writers rely on Ellis to carry the show through their inactivity?

For now though, this is the best comedy on TV.
