Rare to find a network show that I love! Hope all the other episodes keep up the pace. Lucifer is fantastic and I enjoyed ALL the other characters too!

In addition to a great cast; the settings, stunts and camera work were also top notch! I hope they can also film in other locations besides Los Angeles to keep it exciting. The actor playing his evil brother is also worthy of an Emmy! Just wondering exactly who their "father" is, and if we are ever going to get the chance to meet him!

This show definitely deserves 10 stars! Please don't fizzle out!

Wish this Lucifer would also play the main British Devilish Millionaire. "Karl" in the future movie for this edgy novel!
