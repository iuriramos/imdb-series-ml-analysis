Finally, something on Fox worth watching! The concept is outstanding and the complexity of the characters, coupled with the chemistry of the cast, are just a few of the things that make me look forward to watching the next season. There is nothing more satisfying than cheering for the bad guy desperately trying to be good, and Tom Ellis pulls this off brilliantly! Laura German, D.B. Wood, Lesley-Ann Brandt and Racheal Harris are perfectly cast and excellent in their performances. The choice of Tom Ellis to portray Lucifer was sheer perfection as his talents are key to this particular role. The way that he delivers his lines, tongue in cheek, is paramount in the success of this series. Kudos to the writers, the producers and cast for a job well done! The dynamics of this show just work!
