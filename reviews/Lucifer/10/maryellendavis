please keep this on. great lead actor I remember he was a doctor last year. he is very good in both very dry humor entertaining why would parents object to this show? Lucifer is kind and learning to be a good angel!!!very good morality lessons here keep up the great fun, I will be looking forward to many seasons of this series.so many of the good shows are gone before people really get into then. PLEASE do not let this happen to LUCIFER!!when will executives learn what watchers really love in a t.v. show? the writing is also lots of fun I love the plot line I can see this going on for as long as Supernatural which is in its 12 season and no one even knows about that show but a handful of hardcore fans please guys do not let us down by getting us all caught up in this fun show then letting it disappear!!!!!!!!!!!!
