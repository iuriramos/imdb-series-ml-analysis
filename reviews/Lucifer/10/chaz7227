Excellent Pilot hope they let this show breathe a bit being a die hard X-Files fan the lead in was a given but with so many shows previews looking good then you watch them and are thoroughly disappointed I was very happy to see this wonderful new show.

The interaction with Lucifer and his dare I say subjects was incredible especially love the Rachel Harris Doctor character the way she so wanted to tell him was great. Absolutely love it hope they can keep it fresh and keep the Lucifer character getting true thoughts out of people thing going, the way they eventually say what is on their mind is incredible very much looking forward to the next episode and season of this great show. DO NOT JUMP THE SHARK!!!
