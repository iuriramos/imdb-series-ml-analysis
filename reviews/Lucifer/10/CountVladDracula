This is a surprisingly addictive show called Lucifer. I originally wasn't going to give it a chance but I really, really like it.

It airs on Fox here in the US on Monday nights at nine PM and it's loosely based on the version of Lucifer created by Niel Gaiman for the Sandman comics for DC. It's already been renewed for a second season so once you catch up (if you want to watch it) a new batch of episodes will be on it's way.

The premise is this. Lucifer (Yes, the Devil) quits. He up and quits. Think Jack Skellington bored with Halloween. He quits Hell and goes to Earth to open a Night club and the longer he stays on Earth the more human-like he becomes. He's slowly learning things like love, mercy, honor, and a longing to protect the innocent. It's a story about The Devil on a redemption arc if you can believe that. It's a very, very unique twist on The Devil.

An Angel named Amenadiel tries to make Lucifer go back to Hell because Hell needs a ruler and he knows if Lucifer doesn't go back then God might appoint someone else to be The Devil (as apparently this can happen). But the longer Amenadiel stays on Earth the darker he is becoming. As Lucifer rises, Amenadiel is falling. He's doing some twisted and evil things to try to make Lucifer go back so it's likely he'll end up the next devil.

There's a female homicide detective named Chloe. She and Lucifer are friends. She doesn't actually believe he's The Devil. She thinks he's just crazy but oddly useful in solving murder cases. And he's oddly drawn to her so Lucifer becomes a police consultant to hang around her and he slowly comes to realize he is PHYSICALLY mortal around her. He could die if she harms him. Also he gets a literal drug-like high whenever she acknowledges he's done something good. And that's just really adorable.
