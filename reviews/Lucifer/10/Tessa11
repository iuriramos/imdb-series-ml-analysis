If the scripts improve this series is a keeper. 

So much fun....makes all the "Charmed" Alumni happy.

Good writing, sexual tension...what more can a series want. 

Would like to see more about why Lucifer left "home"....and how he got kicked out of heaven...

The real Lucifer, if he exists, could take lessons from Mr. Ellis....

Lucifer needs to expand a bit, from the bar scene, and a few chases after criminals.

Hate it to be just a one-note character....would the "devil" really be stuck chasing one human woman?

Keep this show on, don't listen to the radical religious pundits....it's fun and games.
