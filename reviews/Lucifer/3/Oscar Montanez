Based on the high score on IMDb I thought to give this show a try, but what a disappointment it was. 

It is just another cop/detective series and the only thing that makes it "different" is that there is a devil (lucifer) who is having a vacation on earth and is supposed to "charm" people into telling him their most deep and dark desires. This devil decides to help the pretty and defenseless detective investigate some crimes because he is very much interested in knowing why his charms do not work on her. 

Some overly exaggerated British accent on the devil side and the fact that the detective used to be an actress who showed her boobs in a movie when she started acting add nothing to the plot but are the highlights. 

All in all not worthy of your time and really boring to watch. Episode two was so boring I had to skip forward the last 20 minutes just to see what happened.
