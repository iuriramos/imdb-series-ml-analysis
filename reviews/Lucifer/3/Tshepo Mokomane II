At first, we see Lucifer Morningstar using his trick and guess what, WE LOVED IT. Then every effing episode after that he used the same trick over and over and over again to solve the same lame cases over and over and over AND OVER AGAIN. 

Lauren German's acting is truly bad. Her "wooden" style delivers a very boring character, I know cops are dull but she makes dull cops look interesting. Lesley-Ann Brandt also brings a dull hooker/assistant character. The only person whom I think really showed they can act was Rachel Harris (Psychologist Linda Martin).

SERIOUSLY?? I can't believe I used to tell everyone Lucifer was one of the best series' ever. It seems the first episode was the climax of the season! TOTAL LETDOWN of the Year. What happened?? Never again shall I Utter the words "Lucifer is good"!
