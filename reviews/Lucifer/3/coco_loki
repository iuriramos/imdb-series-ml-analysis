For some reason the main character of the comics which was a delightful sarcastic, non-sentimental, sadistic, asexual and determined entity has been transformed into a joker in this pilot(In all honesty the Hellblazer series would have needed this character more than what it has). What is with all that smile, actual humor, sentiments and an actual drive for sex from Lucifer (Ruler of Hell, and First One to have ever defied God?!?!?) By contrast the only "winged" Angel present seems more evil and determined than the above, which will definitely ignite the Christian communities, cause it actually presents Lucifer as the good guy and everybody else as the misguided flock of good-willing evildoers. That is not what made the comics great and unless the directors are aiming for a Mentalist/Supernatural blend of moonshine this will not go to far.
