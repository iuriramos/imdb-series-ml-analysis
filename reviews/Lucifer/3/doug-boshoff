This is utter garbage. I had to stop watching which, considering it is a pilot, is really bad. 

The concept sounded very interesting, a kind of "Devil's Advocate". Instead, what I got was seriously bad acting. The actors were just trying to hard, in fact, the whole episode just felt desperate.

I watch a lot of shows and have sat through some pretty awful ones, but this was the worst pilot I've seen in years. 

Instead of Lucifer, you get the typical spoiled brat vibe. ......I don't care what daddy says, I want to stay here and be naughty.....

The current rating at the time of writing this is 9.0. There is no way in hell this will stay there, I imagine it will drop to below 7 by the time the masses view this pilot....
