This pilot is not at all close to the comic character created by Neil Gaiman in Sandman and continued by Mike Carey in the Lucifer series. In Gaiman and Carey's works, Lucifer Morningstar is a scheming, apathetic creature, bent on defying God and escaping his creation. Here he is cheerful and playful, following the detective around on this case and humoring those around him.

Mazikeen of the Lilim is seen here without her patent silver mask and has a whole face. Granted, later in the comic series she does get a normal face, it is later in the series and she is not at all happy about it.

Amenadiel demands that Lucifer return to Hell, but Hell should be run by the angels Remiel and Duma.

All in all, if you are a fan of the comic this might not be for you. However, I do recommend you watch the pilot and decide for yourself.
