I can not believe the premise of this show, who pitched this? have they completely ran out of ideas for cop shows, Police Officers have been teamed up with ghost, dogs, puppets, and even their mothers, now wait for it, now we have Lucifer the king of Hell. I have seen this done better in a movie called Horns, if this was a comedy I would completely understand but its not funny, its not fantasy, because who would fantasies about this lame pair up. Stop or the devil will shoot, the devil leaves hell because he no longer wants to play the part God has given him, OK, then he decides to play gum shoe to revenge the death of some random human that I guess we should just guest she means something to him, his partner even tells him stop caring your the Devil, AWWWWW! Terrible show.
