When I read the concept of Lucifer I thought Hell!!! this would be awesome. I was eagerly awaiting the release. When I saw the first episode I thought "not what I had imagined but hey its still worth a watch". But from the 2nd episode it starting getting disappointing with a little bit evil action here or there. I mean Satan fighting criminals, helping people with their miseries, COME ON he could do a lot better. Whatever happened to good old selling our soul to the devil and fulfilling our deepest desires. Now that's something the LUCIFER is good at and he should stick to that. Plus i never really liked Lauren German's acting except in maybe Hostel 2. She is pretty but honestly her portrayal of a cop didn't help the show either. In short the experience was Disappointing.
