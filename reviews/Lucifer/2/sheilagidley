So disappointed in the casting of "Lucifer" - firstly he's not handsome enough, he comes off quite camp-ish. Where's the evil? Where is the diabolical? Why should I care that he's becoming "human" when I haven't seen him be a bad ass demon?

He's more like Russel Brands character of obnoxious 'Arthur' than the Prine of Darkness. There is nothing I find dark or sexually appealing about him. He's reminds me of the gay foster brother in 'Orphan Black'.

You want to see a real bad guy that you grow fond of - Joseph Morgan's character of Nikolass the original vampire in The Originals. Now that is a character I can watch!!!

Overall I think this show had great potential but they flopped with casting and it's a semi- supernatural cop show like The Mentalist - except Lucifer had a fraction of the acting talent.
