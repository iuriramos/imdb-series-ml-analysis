Usual cheap daytime TV soap formulae of the following: 1. Actors chosen for eye candy appeal with little else to enhance the storyline. Evidence: Cheap hourly rates; resumes loaded with never- heard-of gigs of "TV-series". 2. One black in a minor but positive role. He does get to spout some really bad CGI wings every so often. One female usually in a counter starring role and for crime/detective plots she often is the detective. Female det., as if typical, has the weight, strength and athletic agility to be the best - wait, yes, a yoga instructor. What's really poorly thought out is through all her Ep. 1, 2 dangerous detective work her long hair is model loose. Ever hear of tying it back so it doesn't interfere with basic policing? Well, the director caught that minor discrepancy in some later episodes. 3. Since this series has a Satanic vibe, during episode one I was waiting for the cheap and humorously overused red eyes effect (i.e.cheap evil); disappointed, but not for long because guess what shows up in episode 2? Yep, red eyes. Then there is the other cheap Satanic effect floating whatever - people, objects. Again, not to be outdone they added a floating coin and apple - both effects pointless, besides really cheaply done. 4. 90+% of this series is low budget close up filming with cheap props, sets, costumes, just a few actors with lots of talking and no words too difficult for high school beyond 10th grade. OK, Ellis (Luc) does give us some fun dialogue, but that's about all that's worth the hours of one's life. 5. It's just boring, uncreative, ripoff writing.
