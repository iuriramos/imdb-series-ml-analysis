For those who don't know, the premise for this show was taken from a graphic novel, which in itself was a spin off from The Sandman series by Neil Gaiman. 

This show is just awful...they took the premise of the Lucifer graphic novel, shook it up and turned it into...Castle? Seriously, The Devil becomes a consultant for a police department? Has Hollywood run out of ideas? When I first saw the trailer for this, I was excited and yep, I prayed no one would screw this up. Who thought turning a great story into a sad parody of even comedic detective work worth throwing money at?

I watched the first episode and thought, hmmm this is a bit off but lets see where they go with it. After the third episode I can see its ...nowhere. Someone seems intent on making Lucifer Morningstar a childlike sidekick wannabe detective with Mazikeen giving him crap right and left. Mazikeen herself has shown no abilities and has her full face. The denizens of Hell are nowhere to be seen. The show looks like it derailed right after they lifted Lucifer, Mazikeen and Lux right out of the story. Are they supposed to be following the story faithfully? Well, that would indeed be wonderful, but no, that's not what I truly expected them to do either. This is so badly done and pathetic it just looks like theft.

For anyone who thought this was okay so far, please please please look up the graphic novel series, read the summary at least and know that someone has seriously cheapened what was a work of art. 

Hopefully whoever has done this hideous thing will be fired and replaced with someone with actual vision. And to be clear, this is not a reflection on the actors themselves, just those who are supposed to be guiding the storyline, because damn.
