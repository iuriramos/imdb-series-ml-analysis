You could tell so many awesome storys about the Devil, but they decided to make him a shitty consulting detective with no power whatsoever.

The plot is full of holes, every character could be a fashion model, and characters appear in places that make absolutely no sense.

The cop girl for example walks into a drug bosses lair with like 50 armed black drug dealers COMPLETELY ALONE and wants to arrest him.

That's about how much thought goes into every scene and conversation in this series. You can clearly see, that characters act and appear where the writers want them to, rather then what would make sense for the character.

2/10 because it's kinda funny sometimes.
