oh my god, this show had so much potential. The stars are good, and well played but the Lucifer character is nowhere near dark enough. He is supposed to be the devil! Instead you get this rubbish. There is almost no violence, no nudity, no blood, no hope. They really need to make it darker for season 2 if it makes it that far. This is more like a watered down crime show then anything that deals with the devil. He may as well be just someone with a few special powers, because he is no way someone that is supposed to be the ruler of the underworld, even if he is reformed. Here's hoping that they do a rethink before the show gets canned. Update, starting to get a bit better by episode 4 but still got a way to go.
