Let me get one thing straight - I have never read the comic, so I have no idea what the original story/character is like. Even so, I was expecting a heck of a lot more than this. This might just be the lamest, least original, most annoying take on the infamous fallen angel I've seen so far, and I've seen a LOT of them. It bothers me how they're trying so damned hard to make him look like this really cool and savvy guy, and yet he just comes across as obnoxious, patronizing and arrogant - and definitely not in a good way. I'd be okay with it if he was at least a LITTLE bit evil, but he's not. He's fighting crime. He punishes bad guys. He CARES about people. No, seriously - WTF? I think a lot of people would agree with me on this: If you watch a show titled "Lucifer", you're kind of HOPING for the evil anti-hero. Not this laughable excuse for a devil. 

Also, I've only seen the pilot episode so far, but the sheer amount of blatant misogyny in this one episode made me gag. The female detective tries so hard to be tough and stay on top of things, but with the way that this is written, she usually ends up looking like a naive fool next to the oh-so charming and witty prince of darkness. It's actually a bit sickening to watch. (And Christ, let's not even mention the singer who got shot. I'm absolutely disgusted by the way she was written.) The soundtracks are decent, I guess, but sadly not very original. Definitely the typical "rebel" soundtracks commonly used for this particular kind of show with this particular kind of title character. (How many times has "Howlin' for you" been used as a soundtrack by now? Good lord.) 

Overall, I'm just really disappointed. I was expecting so much more.
