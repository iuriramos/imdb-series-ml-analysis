I have been reading Lucifer. Concept and characters were brilliant. I am talking about Comic of course... And... I've started to watch this TV show with an optimistic expectation. It was funny at 1st episode... Then it got boring. And then ... totally destroyed the original characters and plot and everything... If you've read the comics... Stay away this show... it will ruin the originals image...

So if you did not read the comic.. You can watch it as a police story with lots of nonsense. I have read some of the text so I know that actor Tom Ellis is very good actor. Actually its not about acting. They twisted the plot too much its unrecognizable... I think Tom Ellis is a good choice to play the Lucifer... He could play the character but they ruined the character with this plot. Frittering away the original taste...
