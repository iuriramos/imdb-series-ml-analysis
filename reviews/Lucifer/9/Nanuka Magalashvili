I started watching the pilot with great expectations as the title of the show itself seemed pretty intimidating to me. I will draw out later whether I was satisfied or not. I'd like to start with the aspect that impressed me most of all: the soundtracks. All the tracks from the very beginning of the pilot created perfectly suitable atmosphere. In my opinion, soundtracks also successfully serve the purpose of outlining the main character's nature. The plot, alongside with the title of the show, may seem quite provoking to some audiences. However, even though I expected Lucifer to be an absolutely positive character, script writers seem not to have forgotten sadistic nature of the Devil. This earned extra stars for the show from me. However, several plot holes did not let me rate 10/10. What seemed to be the most annoying one for me was the fact that Lucifer knows everything about our pop culture ("Taken" and other movie references, knowing the names of celebrities), however, he seems to be unfamiliar to the way movies are shot (Gray Cooper scene). Another important aspect I would like to outline is acting, which is, I must say, extraordinary. To sum up, the show lived up to my expectations. Recommendation: watch it!
