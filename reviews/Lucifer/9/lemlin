A rare gem in a tired old genre.

It would have been so easy to typecast the Devil ( the easiest type casting ever ) and not since "Bedazzled" have I seen anyone carry off a tongue in cheek, but not cheesy, portrayal as well as this.

Clearly the proof of the pudding, as they say, will be in the eating. I saw enough good in the pilot starter to make me want to sit down for a main course.

The acting was fine and the story did all that was required of a pilot. Hopefully this will be picked up and we can see stronger characterisation and plot development.

I know some people won't like the idea of the Devil being portrayed as charming but really. If he wasn't charming who would sell their soul to him.

More of this series please.
