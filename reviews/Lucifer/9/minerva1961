The kids and I watched this last night, nothing scary, pretty much PG and compared to all the other pilots out at the moment this was very good and has the most potential. We liked Tom Ellis as Lucifer, there was humour and subtle special effects as well as in your face special effects.

The plot was somewhat lightweight but as an opener and for introducing the cast it was good enough, will be interested to see the overall story arc as it develops.

As usual the lead actor has a British accent (though Tom was raised in Wales so should have a Welsh accent), it does work, Lucifer having an English accent and being quite classy - he hates rap but loves the Blues, a man of good tastes!

I suspect the woman are going to like this even more as Tom Ellis is in constant flirt mode throughout the episode but we three blokes gave this a thumbs up and would like to see more!
