A quite interesting show full of dark humour and a singular thread of redemption running through it. Personally I can't understand all the angst against this show I can only assume that a certain segment of society just don't like having their ingrained beliefs shaken. Basically this will end up as a tale of redemption for anyone who is willing to change regardless of their past, which to be honest is a good rule to live by.

The show itself is predictable as it can only be given the storyline but it's actually written in a snappy, obviously non too serious way and is no difference from lets says "Castle" where in reality the only difference is "who" the main protagonists are.

Actually really enjoy the show and it's sub-current of redemption for all regardless of your past. People need to lighten up and enjoy life for what it is not what you've been told it is.
