Whatever it says.. I love Lucifer.. This show is entertaining to me because it's light and somehow funny. And why do i need to compare this character with other devils on other series? He's witty & sarcasm makes me smirk. He's quite banters with Chloe, and his phobic with little kid ( Chloe's daughter ) makes me laugh.. and " Not bad meaning bad, you know ? " ( BTW,i'd taken this from CL, which her song has featured in opening of episode 5 season 1). Well.. all of us has the demon side and try to tame it in our life, just like this Lucifer. I can understand why they add new woman cop character, Chloe really need a friend, ha ha.. Good job for the writers an all PD's line. Please keep on with this show.
