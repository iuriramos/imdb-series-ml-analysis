"Lucifer" achieves its primary objective from the first episode. It makes you want to watch all episodes overnight even if you are not really into police series.

Nice witty sense of humor from Lucifer and good performance by all actors. Mazikeen is my favorite!

It is still very early, but the only thing that troubles me so far is how the writers are going to handle Lucifer's "mortality". From the first episode it was clear that Lucifer had a special connection with Det. Decker, the only human unaffected to his charms. So when he bled from her shot that was fine by me. Let's just hope he doesn't bleed from any random guy's shot. It is a delicate matter given the magnitude of the character.

Another thing for consideration would be "Forms of punishment". Until now, when Lucifer wants to "punish" someone, he flashes his true face and the victim goes crazy. Depending on the nature of one's crime there could be other violent/intelligent options.
