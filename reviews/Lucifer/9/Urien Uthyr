This series got me hooked on the pilot episode. And the series that have done that before, I don't even need all the fingers of my hands to count them.

Tom Ellis is simply brilliant playing Lucifer. He's smart but at the same time so ignorant to the ways of humans. He cares while at the same time sometimes complicating things more than they needed to be. The way Tom handles his character is simply remarkable. And there's real chemistry or at least we feel it as real, between Ellis and Lauren characters. He's the kind of Devil that we can relate to. We understand why he is how he is. We sort of understand where his struggle with God comes from. Making him definitely the center stone of this TV series.

Lauren German, Chloe, also wields her own mystery. The way Lucifer lands in her life and how their relationship develops feels real. She doesn't simply accepts the fact that Lucifer has his uses. No. The way they come to accept they need each other, is a progressive process. It all happens for a reason. And Chloe although initially we can feel her total dislike for Lucifer, Lauren makes Chloe change of mind look and feel real.

This show has a lot potential. Not only for the two main characters relationship and where it can go, but individually as well, each have a lot of baggage in their past to allow the viewers to know there's still a lot we don't know about them. And that holds and grabs me to the show. All the hypothesis, all the paths this series can take... This can become the next really big success if the producers keep up with this winning formula.

If you haven't seen this TV series, then you're losing out on some of the best entertainment I've seen in years.
