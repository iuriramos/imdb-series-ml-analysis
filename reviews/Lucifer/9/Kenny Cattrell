Please I've read the moans petitions about how this glorifies Satan.. Sorry but so does Supernatural. Why do people in the US take this stuff so seriously. It a send up OK? Lucifer is witty and charming with fabulous one liners. The plot is terrible. (So are many of Supernaturals... Sorry guys) but we don't watch it for that.. if we believed every series on TV. I'd be walking around with a tin foil hat "Cos Aliens are here" 

Back to the Pilot.... Our British lead Tom Ellis was all suave and smooth like a very old Brandy. Whilst Lauren German was a little Ditsy but his nemesis, but in truth sexy and funny. A future partner in crime.

With myself and a few hundred UK Facebook friends we can't wait for the next episode. Please.. those petitioners who wanted this banned. have you seen it? Did it make you at least chuckle? Still Nope here's a secret, Aliens have landed!
