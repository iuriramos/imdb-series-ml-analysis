Love this supernatural series. The Devil, played by Tom Ellis; à Devil you only wished hè made you do it, is on à holiday from hell in Los Angeles. Where else. All the characters have been deepend out just enough. We have the lovable detective Chloe Decker and her ex husband also à detective and their lovely daughter, Maze the devilish helper, an archangel who wants Lucifer back in hell, à horny shrink and of course the Devil, Lucifer Morningstar. Lucifer stands out of the crowd; hè is arrogant, ignorant and repulsive. But you have to love him and even feel for him. His plays are so recognicible devilish, emotional and funny. He feels rejected by his Father, so When hè shows his emotion, in à round with à shrink, you would want to redeem him yourself and go to hell and back for him. The story lines are easy to follow and with à biblist twist. Well done Tom Ellis and you can perform à more than decent Sinner Man. I highly recommend this series!!
