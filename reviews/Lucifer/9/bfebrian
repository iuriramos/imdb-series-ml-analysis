I like the way how lucifer never tell lies, he always tell the truth. Please are just not believe in it, or just take it as a joke. The more I watch this series, the more interesting the story line. I can't wait to see when chloe will find out that lucifer is really the lucifer, the Satanhimself, just like he said. I like the way tom elis plays as the lucifer, he really good at. At episode three, the way how he persuade a young woman to jump, is really believable. I don't read the comic book, but I think is a good think, because I will not try to compare it. But, there are many things that not mention in details in the series, like what is the relationship between lucifer and mazikeen? Maybe for some that read the comic will understand.
