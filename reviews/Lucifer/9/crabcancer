Hmm, in the land down under with all our cooking shows, renovations shows and reality shows, this is a total gust of fresh hair. You have the titular character who fits the epitome of the Devil. Suave, smooth talker, snarky and getting away with it.

His power of knowing a person deepest, darkest desires makes for good watching but his inability to read one person is a great hook and line.

I think Tom Ellis fits into this role very well bringing across that Lucifer is the ultimate schemer and plotter.

The thing that I also like in the pilot is the music in the pilot is actually quite fitting.
