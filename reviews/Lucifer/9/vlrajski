Yes, I read the comic. I understand how this show is different from the comic. It was supposed to be. Lucifer has been on Earth in Los Angeles for 5 years. This is THAT Lucifer. Not the Lucifer that jumped portals and dimensions to feed his need for rebellion. 

Now with that over...

I find Lucifer's current character compelling. It is very interesting to see how he is handling his coping with not only being cast out of heaven, but also his time on Earth. Obviously, there will be some issues with how this is mapped out; however, overall his character is well written in my opinion. I find all the characters to actually be well written. They did their homework on psychologists for two characters. The plot has a few holes here and there, but overall I'm extremely happy with how this show is progressing. I believe that once this first season is over that the second season will be even better, if we get a second season. 

I definitely hope this gets a second season. I support this show whole heartedly against any who wanted to ban it for "humanizing Satan." Lol.
