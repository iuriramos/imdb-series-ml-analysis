You can't take this anything like this seriously ! Sit back and enjoy the ride ! It's cleverly written and well acted ! It's pretty much a tongue in cheek parody. The only problem that I see with this fresh take in the devil is... All those so called critics that don't know their asses from a hole in the ground The critics can't manage a grocery list , never mind movie review.. As the wizard of of Oz said "pay no attention to that man behind the curtain"(critics) There are tons of worse things to Watch on TV !! Keep an open mind and I'm quite sure that You will pleasantly be surprised. If you're even a tad bit anal , don't bother wapiti your holier than thou nasty remarks !!
