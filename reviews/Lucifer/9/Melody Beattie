Searching for something to watch, I stumbled onto this show, at first watching out of the corner of my eye (while doing something else). I've now watched all available episodes at least twice and find myself waiting (impatiently) for the next -- which tells me the show is doing its job. The writing, acting, directing, editing -- super. The show makes me laugh -- and surprisingly, cry. With a light, unexpected touch, the series (through the use of metaphors) delves into issues, relationships, and a theme that is both timely and timeless; I don't feel like I'm watching a graphic novel. As the series gains its legs, the episodes just get better and better. Favorite so far is Episode Nine. No spoilers here, just an unveiled desire to see more -- more of the characters and episodes. I want to know where it's going and I'm pleased to see a new spin on a series -- even if it's genre is "cop show."
