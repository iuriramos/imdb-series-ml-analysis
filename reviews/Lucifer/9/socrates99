A guilty pleasure made irresistible by perfect casting and clever writing. I was already a fan of Lauren German but now add Tom Ellis an English actor I've never seen before. Lucifer had to be played by someone who could have fun with the role and still seem plausible. Where they found Ellis to play Lucifer is beyond me, but he's both fun and impossibly assured in the role. 

The story so far is Lucifer is getting increasingly bogged down on his vacation to the point that he thinks a psychiatrist might help. Lucifer who considers himself an expert on punishing the guilty would normally enjoy inflicting pain, but his partnership with Detective Chloe Decker seems to be having a worrying effect on his ruthlessness. Why can she resist him, refusing sex, and what is happening to his immortality?

I'm not sure where the writers are taking the story but they are definitely a brave lot to try to work all these elements into something long-term. If there's any justice in the world, the resolution here will take a very long time to the delight of us fans.
