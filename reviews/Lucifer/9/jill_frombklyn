They changed the guy that played the husband in the Pilot originally and re-shot it with a new guy. Why??? The original worked a lot better than the new guy and Gonzalos had a much better rapport with the cast Plus - two bluish green eyed people can't have a dark brown eyed child. You had better write the original guy back into the show somehow and come up with a reason why it's really his kid so we can believe it. I purchased the Pilot on HD for 2.99 and I was very disappointed because I was expecting the original husband. This new guy is a bummer to me. What happened to make the change? But I do so love the show. Plus I was hoping you would reuse the guy that played the rapper in the Pilot. He was excellent. The chemistry between German and Ellis is fantastic. The show seems to be depending on guest actors that are not very good. I love this show so get some better actors. Through the first 4 episodes I had no complaints with actors in the Pilot but from episodes 2 - 4 there is a lot to be desired.
