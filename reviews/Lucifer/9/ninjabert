Assuming you're not fuming at the mere thought of showing the devil in a TV show, you'll realize that it's fertile ground for some great stories. It's still finding it's feet but has some of the quirkiness of the comics that introduced this character in the first place. The production values are pretty low but they don't need fancy effects - the premise should be intriguing enough really. All actors carry their weight and there's enough character building to hint at more fun to come. Give it a chance - with Neil Gaimans involvement it deserves it. Escapist stuff but I like it - a hell of a lot more than boring a CSI procedural...
