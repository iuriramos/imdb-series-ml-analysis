I really like this show! Stumbled onto it by accident. Didn't know what to expect. It's very loosely based on the DC comic character but the best way to watch it is for itself, rather than comparing it to the comic. I've been enjoying it a lot! 

Tom Ellis is perfect in the part of Lucifer, the devil who takes a holiday from Hell. Just devilish enough, just enough hints at how wicked he might actually be, but all the time with a devilish twinkle in his eye that makes him fascinating and likable in that way bad boys have of being likable. As the show progresses, his Lucifer character has gained complexity and depth that make him increasingly interesting.

The plots are pretty straightforward procedural cop show, as are the stock characters: the beautiful detective, the guy who doesn't want to be a dirty cop, the guy who is a dirty cop, and the various peripherals. But there's a sub-plot developing, manipulated by his yin yang counter-part, the archangel Amenadiel (played by D. B. Woodside with elegant smoothness and an unexpected hint of the sinister), which gives a continuing line to the episodes and will test the loyalties of the characters - and keep the audience watching. I have a feeling it may end up being the cliffhanger at the end of the season.

I find the show is at its best when it focuses on Lucifer himself. His charming bad boy persona is almost campy, but yet irresistible. And his moments of self-examination through the situations he gets into can be quite poignant. He doesn't understand the softer side of things, resents them, tries to subvert them, only to find sometimes he likes them, even needs them. And that could make him vulnerable. Tom Ellis does this with a subtlety that I find quite brilliant. As much as anything, I watch the show for him! 

I'm glad Fox (in Canada, it's on CTV) has given Lucifer the chance to find its footing, and I really hope they keep it going beyond this first season.
