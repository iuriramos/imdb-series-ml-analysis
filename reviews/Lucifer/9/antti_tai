Similar with many reviewers out here I was intrigued by the pilot episode, but the interest shortly waned afterwards with the many non-original detective episodes. 

Luckily I did not stop watching. The story line and character development moves quite fast after a lull of a few episodes mid-season, and by the pen-ultimate episode of season 1 the show is back in its glory.

The repetitive detective format is luckily the backdrop of a storyline, rather than the opposite. As the season progresses all sort of interesting dynamics happen between the main characters, whilst at the same time also introducing new characters with central roles. 

I am really looking forwards to the next episode.

PS: For those of you that thinks Lucifer is too 'human' - Lucifer makes a point in the penultimate episode of the season that he punishes evil, and asks thus why would he want evil to happen?
