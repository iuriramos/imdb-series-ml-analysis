OK, the devil is out for a vacation from hell and lives with human beings? He gets involved with cop stuff? Can this work?

Hell yeah! Because this is surprisingly funny, deep, charismatic, interesting and sometimes evil. I love Lucifer, always being honest and true to himself. At first I really did not know how this cop series could be taken serious and how I would want to watch more than one episode. And here we are, I cannot wait to see the next one. 

Don't get me wrong, this is not the bible and I have seen surely better things in my life, but this is entertainment at its best and I cannot wait to see more.
