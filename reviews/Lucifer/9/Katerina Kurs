This is the show that I don't want to stop watching right after the pilot. In the beginning it seemed a bit 'like thousands before', but Tom Ellis's Lucifer made me waiting desperately for the new episodes. Maybe the plot itself is not a brilliant thing, but the character definitely is, and after several episodes it became a way more intriguing. 

It is very interesting to watch over Lucifer in our everyday life, his reactions, decisions he's making, relationship with others. The mimics of the Devil are priceless, especially when he is experiencing strong emotions. Tom Ellis seems to be almost a perfect Devil, having a bit of humor, a bit of anger, a bit of careless way of thinking, and certainly the sexiest character of the show. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the 'detectives', but there are another good characters, like Linda, played by Rachael Harris, and Trixie's interaction with Lucifer makes me smile every time I see it. Sad, but Mazikeen and Amenadiel could have been made more 'live' and not so plain.

If you don't compare the show with the original comics and just want to have fun (because the TV shows are fun at first place!), I'd recommend to watch 'Lucifer'.
