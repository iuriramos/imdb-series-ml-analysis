After a couple of episodes, the plot did seem to be like a simple crime solving series which they actually do in each episode but that is not the point.

Lucifer's change and his emotional troubles of being the devil seems to be answered by his father through the one thing that builds up excitement inside him which is his thirst for justice.

The answers Lucifer seeks are all being answered one by one through the cases he encounters and I think eventually Lucifer will have a change of perspective once he notices this. After 9th and 10th episode it gets clear where the show's finale is heading.

Overall its a good show which had a few episodes in the middle that felt like they led nowhere but later on humanity is getting the better out of Lucifer.
