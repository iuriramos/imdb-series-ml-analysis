The chemistry between the characters is amazing. I enjoy the interactions between Lucifer and the detective, but most of all I love watching the relationships between the angel Amenadiel, the demon Mazikeen and Lucifer himself - you really get the sense that they go back a long way, and their powerful, sexy, and violent interactions are always great fun to watch.

There are also some excellent performances by many of the actors playing smaller roles, such as Kevin Alejandro as another detective, and Kevin Rankin as yet another detective (without dropping any spoilers, these characters have a very cool story line in the later episodes of Season 1). Another great performance is by Scarlett Estevez - it can be hard to watch child actors as they often visibly struggle with the concept of acting, though this one absolutely nails her role as the lead detective's daughter.

Some people complain about the procedural aspect of the show - a new crime each episode for the two leads to solve, though more often than not the crimes give Lucifer a platform for some interesting character development as he tries to find his way and his role in an unfamiliar human world. It should also be noted that unlike most other procedural cop shows, there is a very strong, fast-paced, and engaging focus on the over-arching story of the show, which in this case is a story of Lucifer as he rebels against those who would see him back in Hell and fights to have a say in he way he lives his life.

My only complaint would be that some of the writing for Lucifer's character can be cringe-worthy, in that while he can be very good with people and is usually the life of a party, he can also be very socially inept and incapable of seeing just how out-of-place some of the things he does are. Nonetheless, this can often make for some funny situations.

Overall, a great show with some really cool (and sexy) characters. Good fun to watch.
