How they said that God has wife And children's, this totally wrong. We know that God hasn't wife and children's and this TV show is based on superstition, there is only one God, and He has no child nor parent. Just like quoted in the Quran:"Say: He is Allah, the One and Only;Allah, the Eternal,;And there is none like unto Him." God is the creator of all. So it is impossible that a God born after His creatures:"Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the Darkness and the Light. Yet those who reject Faith hold (others) as equal with their Guardian-Lord." 

Thats why most of reviewers Give this TV show low rating.
