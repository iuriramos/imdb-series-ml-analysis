how many more series should have less than 7 rating till producers stop making stupid cop shows? another special guy helping police solving cases! we already have I zombie,limitless,blacklist..... there are 3 more i forgot their names! so tired of the same stupid ,boring pointless plot! I'm just wondering how a producer accepts these kinds of scenarios ? i mean they already know the response to these type and yet they do it! i wasted my time watching 3 episodes. putting aside him helping the cop ,there is the part that the angel stops the time and comes in like 2 times per episode and asks Lucifer to go back and every time Lucifer gives him the same answer ! is the angel dumb? or maybe the father don't get it and re sends the stupid angel all the time! the other lame part is the CGI of the devils face!it's so fake and ridiculous that even a 5 year old wont get scared ! and why in hell Lucifer the lord of hell should be so sensitive and kind?he just changes over night to this cool kind guy who cares for others?he doesn't even get angry and he can control his anger! the actor is good but not for this role ! this show is doomed and i hope it get axed along with the other stupid cop shows ! i hope all their producers lose their jobs so they learn how to make series
