The answer: Comedy for boring housewives. I don't wanna go deep on this I Just wanna describe this show in few sentences:

1.-Lucifer is an arrogant dandy with British accent driving a convertible. 2.-Bad, bad acting. 3.-Bad, bad jokes. 4.-Producers want to fill some voids with some drama scenes. 5.-Bad FX. 6.-Excesive Night Clubbing Scenes. 7.-The "King" of the underworld looks Gayish, Oh wait a minute: Is British. I was watching my clock every minute, waiting for the show is over. It was a painful waste of time, I think this moronic series is a waste of time. In my opinion, there is not fair a good Series like "HANNIBAL" is over and this "Lucifer" program is rated with 9 points.

Overrated, Overrated.

Follow this show at your own risk.
