I imagine the meeting between the creator and the studio going a little like this.

Creator " I want to make the comic lucifer into a TV-show" 

producer "What is it about?" 

Creator : " Lucifer trying to free himself from gods creation " 

Producer " Police procedural ?" 

Creator " No .. I " 

producer " Police procedural, is it ! " 

. . .

Did we really need another police procedural ? And before you answer that, did it really need to be based on a graphic novel with such an epic story that it could rival most other literary works ? Calling Lucifer a missed opportunity, is an underwhelming statement, for what is at best a travesty and salute to the lowest common denominator.

The story in this show goes against everything in the comic. The characters are loosely based on the characters in the comic, but share no actual characteristics.

The lucifer in the comics would never care about criminals or police work. In fact one of the major points in the story was how he didn't really cared about human affairs at all and just wanted to free himself from gods creation.

The show in itself, is average, dumb and pointless and would maybe deserve a 5 out of 10.

however, this show took away any possibility of getting the actual story of lucifer to the screen and for that i can't rate it higher than 1.
