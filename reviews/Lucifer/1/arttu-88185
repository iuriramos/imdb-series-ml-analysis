I'm so tired of LA taking a really good comic book and turning in to a lousy film or TV-series without even understanding the point and the depth of the original story.

Lucifer shares the same faith as many Alan Moore screen adaptations (with a few exceptions like "Watchmen") - well made, shallow, boring, funny, totally lacking the esoteric and spiritual understanding. Like taking out the Force off the Star Wars.

Reducing the first born of the angelic host to a LAPD consultant in CSI style just asks for fast forwarding onto some real content that never seems to arrive. I miss the intrigue, the intelligence and the depth of the original story: free will vs pre-destination, the Luciferian gift of understanding the good-evil, the complexity of human co-creation. All the juice.

Out of the respect of film makers I tend to give even shitty films a chance and watch them through but Lucifer is just too damn boring - all those resources wasted on a making the original story worse.

I really hope that the main story line would borrow more from to the comic book story line and take the series to next level.
