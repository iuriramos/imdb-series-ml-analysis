I liked this show until it proved it could be just as political as the hacks that are starring in the rest of Hollywood shows. I am starting to read more, TV is being shut off. I will not spend my money and support leftist liberal progressive communists in our shows. Writers are all liberals and i hate their message because they are the ones spewing hate these days. Will no longer watch this show LUCIFER because your writers and actors show their ignorance. I can no longer support this show, and the actors saying the lines that the writer spew show they are not very bright because they will say any stupid thing that is written for them. Lucifer you have ruined my day, and if you show on Fox or CBS, I will be canceling my subscription to these networks too.
