If this show were entirely new and not based in a comic series, it would still be incredibly lame.

The devil wants to be a private detective and he is having existential issues? Lame. This guy is supposed to be power on a mind boggling scale but he is written with a ton of limitations that make him sound like a run-of-the-mill mystical figure. He essentially has one power - people reveal their darkest secrets to him. That *might* be a good gimmick for a cop show for a human detective but for a character that is supposed to be the most terrifying figure in the universe? No, it simply doesn't work. 

The original comic dealt with events on a grand scale. Lucifer was truly a rebel not some nice-guy-with-bad-rap. And Mazikeen - Maz, where is your mask???? If you have any love for the comic series stay away from this dog.

if you have any love for quality writing stay away from this dog.
