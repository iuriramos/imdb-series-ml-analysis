I would have liked to have said that this is "just another odd-couple police procedural", of which there has been a large number of in recent years. Unfortunately, it falls short of even this low bar.

It recasts the 'Prince of Darkness' as a whiny man-slut who, although his 'super power' is to force others to reveal their deepest darkest desire, is completely clueless as to the motivations of those around him, or even his own.

The result is a self-indulgent incoherent mess.

Any resemblance to the DC comic that it is purportedly 'based on' is limited to the title character's back-story, the name (but not personality) of his principal Hench-woman and the name of the LA nightclub he owns.
