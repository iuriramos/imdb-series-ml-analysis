Really awful. Yes it took me the entirety of the pilot to get past the point that the only thing this show shares with one of my favorite comic books was the name, but then I watched the next one with an open mind... "Let's give it a chance," I thought,"Maybe it's good for it's own reasons. Maybe they've done something interesting by changing all the characters and the premise and the general tone and atmosphere"

They haven't. It's entirely too glib, their version of Lucifer is classless a 2D character trying desperately to pretend he has depth, the humor is juvenile, and nothing stands in the way of this being a descent show more than their insistence that it be another run of the mill procedural drama (except where's the drama?) with a devil who's being treated more like an underpowered superhero than a cosmic being.

If you're going to adapt a character as fleshed out and nuanced as the Lucifer we see in Mike Carey's comic, you have to do a much better job than this. It just seems like every aspect of this show, most notably the writing and acting, is being phoned in with no attention paid to quality. Try harder, do better, and if you want to make cheap, artificial, Hollywood crap, don't drag something better than what you're making down with you. This could just as easily have been unconnected to the comic and I would have completely ignored it after seeing how awful it was. Since I know the source material has given them so much more to work with, I see it as a major failure.
