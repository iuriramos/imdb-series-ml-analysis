THEY have a plan that sounds more or less like this: let's take something with market value, buy the rights, send the whole package at our underground monkey writing lab, spin the story until devoid of any meaningful plot it becomes just another tasteless format. There you go! Now let's tease the fan base with some useless reference to what they love while carefully not scaring our formatted public with anything new or original. At this point the first obvious question would be: why bother? Production companies have hundreds of complete and developed stupid format ideas when it comes to cop shows or hospital shows, you want the single-mum detective? Got it! The drunken rough but wise cop on his road to salvation? Got it! You want the teenager cop who solves crimes in partnership with a ghost? Got it! So? Why ruin good source material to produce an awfully anonymous copy of the very same format? As it happens I have my very own conspiracy theory: they're out to buy and destroy any kind of original piece of writing which now or in the future might pose a threat to the "same-s#itty-idea" global domain, they have agents everywhere, they even start up innocent-looking production companies apparently untied to their secret organisation to acquire TV rights of everything and kill ideas in their cradle. Sounds good? I'm selling...
