I don't know why, but i REALLY hate this show. I just do. If you like it, good for you. It doesn't make you a bad person. But i really despise this show.

First of all, why is Lucifer, the devil, the lord of all darkness, for lack of a better word, fighting crime? I understand this is based off of a comic book, but just make him a super villain. Why does he care if people are being murdered? He's the DEVIL!!!! Maybe it's just because of my Catholic background that i'm so mad about this, but, Jesus, it's just stupid! And also, why does nobody in the show give a reaction when he reveals himself to be the devil. They should either laugh at his face, or defecate into their pants!

Again, if you like this show, fine, but don't try to make me think it's entertaining.
