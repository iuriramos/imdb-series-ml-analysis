What's the point of this show other than to fill a time-slot vacated by other failed shows? The devil, the potent symbol of temptation and evil, is rehabilitated into an avenging cop wanna-be. Really? He's depicted as a Hollywoodesque alluring male fantasy-figure: well-groomed, athletic, with an upper-class British accent and possessing cool cars, clothes, and big boy materialistic toys. He's anti-children (i.e., anti-responsibility). Hmmm, a page taken out of the old, tired Play Boy magazine formula. Yawn. It lacks wit. Los Angeles as a surrogate Paradise Lost? Would have been amusing to see how the Devil would respond to a LA rush hour traffic jam or proselytizing Christian street-missionaries instead of stereotypical 'beautiful people' in night club shticks. We can only hope that Lucifer gets sent back to hell where he belongs in short order.
