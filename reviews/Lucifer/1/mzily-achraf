Extremely disappointing, what a bad acting from all actors and actresses no exception. I was so thrilled at first but within 15 minutes of the pilot I realized how shallow and poorly written and performed it was, and it went on and on in the following episodes. Bring Back RUSH! Tom Ellis was much better in than this painful series of 30 minutes long episodes. It is a show with a great initial concept, but was very poorly executed, like what were they thinking, they just ruined what could have been a new thrilling and brilliant show. It surely does not deserve the rating other users are giving it, please let the production do something about it. Rush should have stayed on and Lucifer should get canceled.
