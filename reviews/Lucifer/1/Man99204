This program is guaranteed to provoke a "religious experience" in any viewer. As you watch it, you will think to yourself "oh GOD ....could it get any worse"? 

I must admit that I have very LOW EXPECTATIONS for anything Fox does. But this has to be an all time low - even for Fox.

The core problem is the casting of Tom Ellis as the central character. The character of Lucifer is supposed to be charming and enticing and at least mildly interesting... Mr. Ellis is none of those things. He may look like an underwear model, but he is totally lacking in charisma. He plays each scene in exactly the same way -- as if he has had far too man injections of "emotional botox". He is one of the most BLAND and unappealing Actors I have seen in the last decade.

And whose idea was it to have the Devil speak with a British accent?

The pilot episode, aside from the demonic character, is totally devoid of any originality. There is not one pesky new or original idea.

The fact that this Stinkeroo premiered in January should indicate the very low level of confidence Fox placed in the series.
