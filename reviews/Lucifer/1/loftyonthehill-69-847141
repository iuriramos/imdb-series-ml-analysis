How many times has the Satan attached to cop/moral freelancer redeeming/punishing errant souls in America been done now? Just off the top of my head I can think of Brimstone, Reaper, The Collector and now Lucifer. The latter is easily the worst of the bunch.

I kid you not with the following synopsis - Devil (Lucifer) takes break from punishing the Damned by following around a former soft porn actress (so she clearly had a so-called sinful past requiring penitence) turned detective in Los Angeles and helps her solve crimes. Detective wants to bring miscreants to justice, Lucifer wants to sadistically kill them. Moral dilemma ensues. A bit of an infernal side story runs concurrently with weekly plots which tries (but fails miserably) to maintain interest.

Keeping with its theological theme, this show is irredeemably awful with no saving graces. All the characters are really poorly devised and the actors and actresses who play them have the skill of a low grade repertory company. The worst offender is the lead, Tom Ellis playing an English Simon Cowell style camp metrosexual is bad enough but one has to wonder what even he thought of the script. It's almost Austin Powers-esque but at least Mike Myers played it tongue-in-cheek. The misogyny is so overt in Lucifer that I'd quite like to see the gender, age and previous credits of the writers.

Tired, wooden and nonsensical cop show. Nothing more, nothing less.

PS. I know this is an Amazon/IMDb show but 8.7 out of 10. Really? I think I'd quite like to see the IP addresses of some of the raters/reviewers as I suspect many would originate in South Asia. That might also explain the swarms of "unhelpfuls" critical reviews are getting which pushes them way down the list when viewed in the default "best" option.
