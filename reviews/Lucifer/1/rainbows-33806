How tragically sad it is that some TV viewers consider this to be in any way creative, artistic or inspiring. What low standards!!! After happening to some across this, and viewing 15 minutes of such typical Trash A Vision, I felt sick and changed the channel. This is boring, typical TV and vile. I am still recovering. Do producers actually think that shocking us with blow jobs and new ways of displaying violence against women is what viewers want? What a waste of time on the part of anybody involved with this. Don't waste your time or any bit of your good heart or valuable time with this low quality junk. 'So done with the overwhelming vast majority of TV folks.
