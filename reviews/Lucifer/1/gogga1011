Something moronic like this can invent only Americans. For some, this show will act as harmless fun, but the intention of the series is clearly not only fun but also a glorification of evil. In the world, especially in America, Satanism is a very widespread and popular. And they do not believe in some imaginary evil, no, they really believe in the real evil and worship him. And then to the public they are saying that evil does not exist and that it was all just a big hoax. The real deception is in fact that it is through these series wants to tell the people that evil does not exist and that it is actually sweet. So find a charming actor, and throw in a couple of "bad" clever dialogue, so that the evil became charming, seductive. Slowly, as the series progresses, you will see that the intention of these "harmless" show do just that - erasing the line between good and evil and finally you will became a passive moron.
