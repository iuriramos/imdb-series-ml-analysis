I love Hawaii Five-O. Can't wait for the new season. I hate to admit but I wasn't happy too see Catherine return. There is something about her character that is dry and unassuming. For some reason Catherine and Steve's relationship is stale and corny. I'd like to see someone with him that's challenging. Steve's accent is very apparent most of the time.

I love Adam and Kono together and glad their relationship worked out. Can't wait to see where their marriage and relationship heads. Jerry, Kamekono and Max characters are hilarious. Glad Jerry become a reoccurring character on the show. Would like to see the personal lives of Chin (sexy) and Lou some more.
