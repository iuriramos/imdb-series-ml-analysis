Having seen the older 5-0 series which lasted 12 seasons, I decided to watch for these series and already liked it. Although the actors playing the main characters are not as vibrant as in the older series, they do a very good job. Alex O Laughlin plays a very cool but tenacious Mc Garrett, Scott Mc Caan plays a relaxed, funny but efficient Danno, Daniel Dae Kim seen in Lost and 24,does a very good job as Chin Ho even though sometimes, his character seems to be self effacing and Kono aka Grace Park is a great character and makes an interesting addition to the team. The scenes are always filled with lots of action and speed, add to this beauty of O'ahu and you have all the good things of what makes this show a good one.The plots are always interesting because they interfere with the past, the present and the future of the characters.I am waiting for the season 2.
