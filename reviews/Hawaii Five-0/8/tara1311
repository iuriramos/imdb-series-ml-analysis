I'm a fifty years old fan of the old show and I totally agree with the review given above: it has nothing to do with the show as we knew it.

However I think it's a good show, though be it positioned in 2011.

Youth nowadays probably won't like the show as it was. It had hardly spectaculair action in it as this show does and would probably be considered dull and wouldn't attract viewers at all (except for the old folks like us, that is...) 

My children and I enjoyed the pilot and can hardly wait to see the next episodes. We sure hope the series will be out on DVD as well and would love to see more seasons: I surely think this series is a winner but, once again, it isn't really Hawaii Five-O.....
