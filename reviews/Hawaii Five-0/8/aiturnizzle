I'm a fan of Alex O'Loughlin's so i made sure to catch this one (even though i'm already inundated with procedural cop shows!), but was pleasantly surprised to see how well this worked.

I'm a little too young for the original, but this remake has some promising features. The action is believable, has good pacing, and the character development in the first episode seemed pretty good.

The dialogue was clich√©d in some parts, but the interactions between Danny and Steve are amusing and really works well in allowing the viewer to warm to the characters.

I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating for the pilot alone, so hopefully the season maintains this level of quality! I also got a kick out of seeing Norman Reedus, Will Yun Lee (lol the accent) and SPIKE! *ahem* James Marsters making guest appearances :)
