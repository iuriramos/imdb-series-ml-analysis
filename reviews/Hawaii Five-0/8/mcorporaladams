I started watching the show when it first came out, although I didn't watch the original I thought I'd give it a shot.

At the beginning, it seemed very unprepared especially the first episode. As time when on, it seem to excel slowly but surely. Myself, being in the military before noticed there were some small errors in the show but they're actors not soldiers.

The music, acting, mystery and action are tied together very well. Depending on the episode, it can either really make you think or just be a little off, but none of the episodes are boring. I like how the show also ties love into this, with Danny "Danno" Williams and his wife Rachel, her daughter Grace "Monkey" Williams and her new husband Stan. Also, Chin and his girlfriend, in later episodes his newlywed... and the main character Steve McGarrett and his girlfriend Captain Rollins.

The constant thrill, excitement, love, betrayal, comedy and everything just seems tightly strung. In Season 1, and early Season 2 McGarrett is come to with an issue, the issue being his father was murdered over something. This thing was called "Shelbourne". This is the constant mystery along with many others like if Chin used to be a dirty cop, or Kono when threatened by Internal Affairs to pretend to be a dirty cop.

Now, the show isn't perfect but I definitely recommend it to anyone that likes an action/comedy. A good cop show, with a few laughs after a hard day at work to take some stress off your plate.

8/10
