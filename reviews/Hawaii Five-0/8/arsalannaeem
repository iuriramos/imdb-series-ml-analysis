i love this TV show. i love Steve McGarrett and danny williams characters but i just hate the character of kono (grace park).she is a terrible actress. i never hate any character in my life the most than this kono. she is just average actress. other than her this is a very good and refreshing TV show. action scenes are very well performed. steve is my most favourite character in this TV series. i watched all the episodes of this series.this show is a nice mix of action, suspense and light comedy. Kamekona is also a very funny character in this show. CBS has done a wonderful job by creating this amazing show. i wish them very best of luck for their future plans. i hope this show will continue for at least 2,3 more seasons. good luck to everynoe related this show except grace park. my advice to her that please left this show so we can enjoy this TV show.
