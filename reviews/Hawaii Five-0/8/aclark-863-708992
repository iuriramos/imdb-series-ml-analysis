As a member of the "older" generation who grew up with the old Hawaii Five-O, I watched with great interest how the new one would compare with it. After watching the first three episodes, I have to say that there is nothing to compare except the location. It is beautifully done for the 2lst century. The format for the old show would look dated and old - not only to young viewers but even to the over 50 set like myself. The cast is wonderful and, truthfully, the main reason I watch this show is that I've been an Alex O'Loughlin fan since Moonlight. He is a very dynamic and charismatic young actor, and I truly hope that his role as McGarrett will afford him the opportunity to really showcase his acting talent and not just have him as a pin-up boy vigilante. He is so much more than that. This show has so much potential for character development and crime-fighting stories. Let's all just sit back, get to know the characters and just enjoy this great new show. The only drawback for me ---- way too many commercials !!!
