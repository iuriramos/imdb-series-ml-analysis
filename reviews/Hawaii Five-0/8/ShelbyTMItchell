The show is a kinder and more gentler show. But the original is always going to be the original. As Australian actor Alex O Loughlin is the lead role as Steve McGarrett played by the late originally, Jack Lord.

His character is a Navy SEAL and is asked by the Hawaii Governor to be the leader of the Hawaii Five 0 task force. After his father was killed. That made him also come back to Hawaii.

He also recruits reluctant but than really good friend and partner, Danny "Danno" Williams(Scott Caan) as his Danno version of the character is a single father who reluctantly moved to HI from NJ to be with his young daughter, Grace.

Rest of the cast is Lost's Daniel Dae Kim as Lt Chin Ho Kelly. Who has his own issues despite being accused of corruption. He still is a great cop. And his cousin, Officer Kalakaua played by Battlestar Galatica's Grace Park.

This is more of a kinder and opened up emotional Steve McGarrett for this era. Than the more buttoned down Jack Lord version.

Sure that the stories are pretty cheesy at times. But this is a new era! But the chemistry between the four characters are really what make the show!
