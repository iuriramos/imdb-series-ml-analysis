For those who are looking for a Jack Lord - James MacArthur continuation, stop watching now. This ain't it.

For those who saw the "new" Star Trek and enjoyed it, this is your chance to see "the alternative universe" of Hawaii.

As mentioned in other commentary, there are good and bad points... just like any other production. There is a LOT of suspension of disbelief in this one. Some of them, like McGarrett's now-I'm-in-the-Navy-now-I'm not and the governor's license to kill arrangement, are VERY far fetched. But if you can get past that, you will enjoy this show. If you are looking for the real world, why are you watching police drama anyway? The only shows that were anywhere CLOSE to realistic were Barney Miller and Hill Street Blues.

But really... this is NOT a remake.

It's a re-do.
