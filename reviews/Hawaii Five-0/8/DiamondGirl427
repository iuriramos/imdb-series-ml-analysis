This has the makings of a great show...but they need better story lines to boost it along. I wasn't sure that I would be interested in a re-made version of a great show I recall from childhood...but I like the actor who is playing McGarrett from other things I have saw him in..and when I saw he was going to be cast in this I thought I would watch. Like so many other remakes...I thought it would truly be a piece of junk..which it wasn't at all. I remember looking forward to seeing the undated version of "Miami Vice"...and was sorry I ever bothered when I did...it just did not have the same flair and style of the original. But...I can say this new show has promise. Scott Cahn is a decent actor..he seems to work well in this case too....as the cop who doesn't quite fit in..but seems to be trying anyway. Changing up a character from male to female seems to work too...but after all...the original did not have any female cops in it at all...being a police detective, etc. was a male oriented thing back then. Times have changed. While it is doubtful that a police chief would have full rein to do as he pleased while wearing a badge is doubtful...it kind of makes sense here...and after all...it is just a script not reality. The last episode had McGarrett in bed with a sexy woman....obviously this is a modern version of more or less the same guy? In older times...sex may have been implied but NEVER really dwelled upon....the censors said NO-NO...not allowed. It was a mainly cop show...from beginning to end. It is still the same show...with modern things added. Maybe the tag-line "Book-em Danno" is going to be used a little too much...it seems like it is...but over all...it is a good show and worth watching.
