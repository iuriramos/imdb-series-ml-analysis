My liking for this show is probably based on fond memories of the original Hawaii 5-0 series and the awesome theme music, but I always enjoy watching this updated version. Although the show is not very realistic and it's very sentimental, it's got good production values and a good ensemble cast that works well together through the story arcs. Hawaii is a kind of promised land/last resort for people who couldn't quite make it on the mainland. It's also portrayed as a kind of Asian bridge that has its own society and hierarchy separate from the mainland USA. The 5-0 squad come from all over but are united in their desire to help the weak and see justice done. It's a solid police procedural with endearing, individualized characters, and it acknowledges the Pacific Rim aspect of contemporary Hawaii as a multi-ethnic enclave with strong Asian influence. Book 'em Danno.
