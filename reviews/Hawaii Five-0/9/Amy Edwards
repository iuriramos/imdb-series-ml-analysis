The first thing I have to say is I never watched the original show. I'm only familiar with the actual reboot and I really love it so much.

It's way cool, funny and so enjoyable to watch. I really love the interactions between the cast especially between Danno and Steve. They are always bantering each other on every topic. Nevertheless they are like brothers and they really care about each other. We can see that when Steve is comforting Danny when he lost his brother blaming himself for what happened or in the very last episode when Danny give a part of his liver to save Steve's life after he got shot and nearly died. You have to care so much about your partner to do such thing.

The rest of the cast follows in their step. Lou, Max, Kamekona and Jerry are really a lot of fun and coolness within them which makes the scenes they appears very colorful. I really love Kamekona, the big but so kind shrimp guy and unofficial Five-O informant, who always help his friends in their cases in a very relax way. Kelly and Kono are also very good characters, tho much more serious and focused than their counterparts.

The another great point is the Oahu scenery. As I've already been in Hawaii in vacation, It's really bringing me great memories and makes me want to go back so much. The surfers playing with the wave, the sun, the beaches, the Hawaiian music. I could never have enough of all of this. It's feeling like a dream.

The plots are also very cool and entertaining in add of being very original and various. It allows us to visit the islands all over but also abroad where some episodes are taking place in Afghanistan, North Korea, China, Colombia or the main land.

What a show!
