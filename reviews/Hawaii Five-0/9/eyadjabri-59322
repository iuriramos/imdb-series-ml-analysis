Hawaii Five-0 is by far one of the best all time T.V shows to ever exist. The show consists of the usual bad cop good cop routine but the show does it in a way which keeps it entertaining not just in every season of the series but in every single episode. Alex O'Loughlin the actor who plays as the main protagonist he fits the role extremely well and truly is enjoyable to watch as his character progresses with his task force. Through many seasons of the show the thing that truly amazes me is how the show is not just revolved around one protagonist but many protagonists thus making it constantly appealing to all types of viewers because each protagonist has their own story line. The show has been around since 2010 - 2016 and i hope it may keep on going further and further through the coming years because it is genuinely an amazing show. Hawaii Five-0 has lots of extreme action moments incredible acting great story awesome characters and amazing cinematography.
