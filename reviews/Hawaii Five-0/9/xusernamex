Never having seen the original, I compare this to other cop dramas on TV right now. After watching the pilot, I was impressed, and plan on giving this show a shot and added it to my DVR schedule.

While I found the McGarett character strictly okay in the pilot, I think the rest of the team did a great job. Park and Kim were good, and Caan was just brilliant. After seeing Scott Caan play a bunch of stereotypical jerks (Entourage, Ocean's 1X), it came as a surprise to see him pull off the role of doting single dad, and a slightly mature character. The team seems to have good chemistry.

Overall, it was a good introduction with a blend of good action, humor and a fast moving story with beautiful locations.

I look forward to watching the next episode, and think this show has great potential to stick around for a while.
