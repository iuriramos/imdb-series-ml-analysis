When I was first told there would be a remake of Five-O, my first response was 'Oh great, a good original show, about to be CSI-ed with lame dialogue, impossible story lines, and unbelievable action sequences'. (I had canceled my cable subscription when I realized there was absolutely no shows on, that I wasn't critical of. The straw that broke the camel's back was when the History Channel started showing, what seemed like 20 hours a day of CSI). With that said, I was negative, but hopeful, after all, I grew up with the original.

When I saw the first episode I was very pleased. The characters, although they have the original names, but different backgrounds, tend to have chemistry that could make this a hit, like the original. The action scenes were good, believable, and not overdone. The fight scenes were obviously choreographed by some one who had a clue. The story line was good, with lots of action befitting of a hit action movie. (I hate shows where the main characters get into a fight with a smug attitude that no one can hurt me, and then dominate the fight). Even the dialogue was entertaining, witty, and refreshing.

If I have to pick anything to be critical about, it would be some of the music. Somehow the short quips of rap music, with the surfing visuals, doesn't mix. This jumped out at me as if it were a piece of Mozart's work. What's next, surfers with their hats on sideways wearing gold chains that take them to the sea bottom? Sorry, that music doesn't work with me. A word to the writers. Please don't screw this show up like so many shows before. Keep it believable. I loved it.
