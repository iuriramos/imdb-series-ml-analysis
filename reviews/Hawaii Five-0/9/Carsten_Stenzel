I have never seen the original show, but one doesn't have to in order to enjoy this one. I watched Magnum in the 80s (and since), and I am really amazed about the changes in production style since then. Hawaii always was one of the main-cast in Magnum; it looked so wonderful, that I had to fly there in the mid-90s. But, the style and equipment of movie-production has certainly changed. So many shoots from above, moving through the landscape and those great colours. Well, that's for the Looks of the Show. I really enjoy the cast and the chemistry between them, even though they are in their fist season. I am so glad that this isn't just another CSI-Clone. I have had enough of those cool and phoney shows. Here we actually have fun and a certain light-heartedness that might evolve over the next few years into something eaqually great as Magnum. Hawaii 5-O is now officially my second favourite show (of modern day shows). Well, I still like NCIS the most.
