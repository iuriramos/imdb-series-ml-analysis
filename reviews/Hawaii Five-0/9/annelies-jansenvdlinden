I try in my best English OK, I was a fan of the old series Hawaii Five O, especially with Jack Lord, I see that series many times.

So I taught the new series Hawaii Five O that there where old players, but it doesn't. I know because of the dead from the father of Steve, but I didn't see the end of the last old series.

Maybe that they in the Netherlands are not so far. They bring now the new series from Hawaii, The first players are good, Steve and Danny, but not the other players. Kono must played by a man.

I taught with that old tape by the governor, that we saw than Jack Lord, but that was also another man.

But I find this series finally very good, and I look with pleasure every week OK, and we hope that be very much new series come also to the Netherlands, wish you good luck with it, and much greetings from a good fan from the Netherlands.
