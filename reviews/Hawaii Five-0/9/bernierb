It is hard to compare a remake to the original counterpart. Most of the time they are complete let downs. What was serious and interesting might turn into a comedy and in a farce in a remake which this show did not do and i thank the producers for that.

I think all the actors are great even though a lot of people seem to disagree with the choice of Alex as the lead.

People are forgetting that Steve is the character that drives the show 99% of the time and he is the one who stirs the plot into its direction while the others gravitate around him. The old show was like that and the new one is the same which is great.

Also i like Alex because he oddly reminds me of Nicholas Cage and i like his stuff most of the time.A not holds barred attitude in action sequences....

The settings of Hawaii are well exploited and the guest villains or guest stars are well chosen.

Everyone i know who watches the show thinks this is great.

It sure beats the hell of all those stupid TV reality shows that seem to pollute our TV's now.

Aloha! I don't think people would have liked to see a 50 year old run a bunch of 30+ policeman and trying to run with them on a foot chase...it would have looked odd and goofy.

I think he is entertaining to watch even tough people says he is stiff which i think is unfair to him. He is exactly in character with what the authors of the show have set him up with.

Scott Caan and Daniel are great with their parts and Grace is always fun to watch although she looks way too skinny now for some reason. But that is my personal opinion on that.

the choice of Mark Dacascos for Woo Fat also is great and i am sure will reap some great rewards.
