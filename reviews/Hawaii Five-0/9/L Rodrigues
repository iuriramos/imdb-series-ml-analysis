First of all, I agree with just about all of the comments made about the show so far. At first I was convinced that the producers made a fatal mistake with their selection of Alex O'Loughlin as Steve McGarrett, but he has grown on me. He is way better than Jack Lord (who always looked a bit constipated).

Being a HUGE "Lost" fan, I was hoping to see Josh Holloway in the lead role. I still think that he and Daniel Dae Kim had great chemistry and would have brought that to the new project. 

Here are my two pilikia (that's the Hawaiian word for problems for you mainlanders) with the new version of the show: 

1) LOSE THE RIDICULOUS TECHNICOLOR FILTERS! They may make the trees look greener, but they cast a horrific green tinge over our beautiful blue water too. 

2) I know it's supposed to be "trendy," but Danno and Steve should shave every now and then... especially Danno. He looks like a bum.
