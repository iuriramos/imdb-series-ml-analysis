Trying to be Miami Vice in Hawaii but fall flat

This show got every stereo type clich√© in the book. The divorced cop with a troubled relationship with he's ex-wife, and their preteen daughter caught in between. (And why should he be any different from every other movie cop, so when they suddenly need a hacker he knows one right of the bat. Even though he suppose to be new on the island) The though ex-military guy with grudge, who off course is an ex navy seal (why can't they for once be Green Beret or a Delta or a Ranger.) And the hot sexy eye candy, whom off course would rather be a cop and fight bad guys, than a movie star or a model etc. And off course the Asian/native Hawaiian cop. Guess there wasn't any black actors available for audition. Anyway they've worked hard to cover all the fan bases just to make sure. Someone should tell Scott Caan, that he doesn't have half the acting chops he's old man have. The guy can't act. He belongs in fraternity movie, where he can drink beer burp and act like a douche

**************** spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler************ One of the most stupid scenes happens when they main hero I the middle of a car chase calls a girl whom works on an aircraft carrier, (and she of course have her Iphone switched on, lying next to classified tech equipment, while she's working as a radar/satellite operator. which I'm pretty sure is a big no-no) And ask her for satellite surveillance of car they are chasing, but lost track of It gets even more stupid when after breaking several of a person's civil rights. Scott can (Who can't act) goes into this big monologue about how they can't arrest the suspect cause they only got a name and knowledge that its connected to bigger crime, but no solid evidence they could take to court. The duo often have these cheesy dialogs while driving, usually right after they have just broke several laws and are about to break another one. I also find it kind of fun that they walk all over the crime scenes leaving finger prints every were, and none they arrest ever goes to court with the hole testifying thing They even have the worst care chase in history and SUV vs. a smaller sedan; the good guys ride the SUV (off course) and the bad guy the sedan. And every time the sedan pushes into the SUV the sparks explode like fireworks,, Someone should explain to these producers that NAVY SEALS are actual marksmen and good fighters, these people can't fight their way out a wet paper bag, not to mention hit a target. Every time they gonna storm a building, everybody goes in to the front, so the bad guys can escape through the back window/door. This happens 98% of the times
