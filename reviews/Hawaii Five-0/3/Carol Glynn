Spoiler alert!WTF!I'm sick to death with woe fat. He should be dead. Really, straight on machine gun fire and he didn't even get hit with one bullet. I'm suppose to believe Danny is such a bad shot. It's a machine gun, you don't have to be that accurate to hit your target. The writers for television have lost their minds and don't know how to write GOOD story lines anymore. I refuse to suspend realty that much. I really liked (past tense) that show. He has killed so many people, if nothing else karma should dictate that his luck has run out. McGarrett doesn't need one nemesis. Every criminal is his nemesis. What's with this stupid trend of having a bad guy getting away with his crimes and goes on living the sweet life with no repercussions. No wonder people are shooting other people and thinking they can get away with it. TV is telling them they can. How irresponsible can you be. Whatever happened to finishing the story in the hour allotted? I am so sick of this. It is single handedly ruining TV for me. This is the only entertainment I have and the stupid writers are ruining that for me. How selfish can you be. I don't know if I will watch it anymore if this is what I can expect.
