I used to watch the original Hawaii 5-0 and don't remember any of the characters with personalities so difficult that I couldn't watch the series. However, though this series is new and not like the previous one, and I understand that, but the Danny character in this series is so dad- gum negative that it is too hard for me to deal with. I literally have to mute the TV every time he has a speaking role! I suggest you tone down his negativity a bit so that it is more balanced and perhaps I might enjoy the series better. Overall, the script is good, the rest of the actor's roles are great, and now that I am used to the new Steve McGarret, I probably might even get hooked if it weren't for such a negative role that Danny plays.
