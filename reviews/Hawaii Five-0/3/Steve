Like a lot of people we were looking forward to the new series of Hawaii 5-0 but i have to say that after 2 episodes i am not sure i can watch it again. Love Hawaii, love the scenery but not sure that is enough to keep me interested week in week out. I thought that the first episode might be a one off in terms of a formulaic plot development and story line and that it could only get better. Unfortunately, episode two has just confirmed my fears that the producers have gone for the easy option of buff guys and gals, nice scenery, nice cars and lots of noise in place of a decent story and any attempt at character development. The H5-0 theme is the best thing about the show but to be honest they could have called the show anything as it bares no other similarity to the original. And just for the record i am no die hard fan of the original by any means but from what i have seen of the new version this show could easily have been so much better.
