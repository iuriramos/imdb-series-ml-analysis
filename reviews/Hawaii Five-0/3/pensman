There can be only one Steve McGarrett and Alex O'Loughlin isn't him. I had hoped to like this series but there is nothing new or old here. Alex O'Loughlin leads a cast without chemistry. While it's nice to see Hawaii again as background, it's not enough. Scott Caan comes across as more of a poor imitation of Don Johnson's Crockett than a fleshed out Danny Williams. Instead of living on a boat with a crock, he has a kid. Big change for the worse. And plot is just shoot em up Burn Notice/N.C.I.S. Los Angeles. There is a lot of yelling, a few sob's tossed about (no doubt to prove it's an adult show), and big guns. Yawn.
