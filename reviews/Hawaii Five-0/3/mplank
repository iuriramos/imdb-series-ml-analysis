The constant bantering between McGarrett and Dan is very irritating and mostly useless. Have turned this show off many times because of it. Where is the value? Maybe they just need more content to their story line.Maybe they think this stuff is funny or amusing, but mostly it is just irritating. The other stars of the show add something of value and it seems more realistic with them. Their antics should be replaced with more story line and content to the value of the show. Maybe they should give the other characters more lines and content if they have that much time to waste on bantering of McGarrett and Dan. It is silly and immature at best. We have turned this show off of our weekly list.
