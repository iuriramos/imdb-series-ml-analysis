It would be unfair to compare this latest incarnation of Hawaii 5 O to the original as this is, apparently, a "re imagining " of the sixties classic. Presumably that means that, locations and characters notwithstanding, this show is trying to be something the original was not. I agree with that, because, while the Jack Lord classic was never less than entertaining, this show is anything but. For example, the plots are repetitive and the dialogue is laughably bad. To be fair, that could be said of any number of crime dramas on television today, but what makes Hawaii 5 O an especially gruelling viewing experience is the acting, which ranges from indifferent to just plain bad. The writers and, by extension the actors, have made the characters unlikeable. To me, that's the kiss of death for any series.If you can't invest in the characters, what's the point of watching? What's really surprising is that this show comes from the normally reliable producers of "Lost" and "Fringe", two shows that tower above this junk. White silver sands and palm trees swaying in the breeze can't save this very poor show.
