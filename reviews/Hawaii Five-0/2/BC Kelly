So far, my jury is still out

The opening episode was good, in spite of the VERY opening scene/set-up/intro that was confusing and muddled as a way to get acquainted, imho

Then the 2nd show was total TV Trash and waste of an hour - chase, chase, shoot 'em up, chase, chase - more video game than what should be expected of what CBS says is the "Best New Show on TV"

3rd Episode was 1/2 good, but 1/2 all over the map, and can't remember which 1/2 was good and which 1/2 sucked - yea, THAT memorable

OK CBS - in about 1/2 an hour we get Episode 4

I'll hang with you ONE more time, and see if you go 2 to 2.5 for 4, or hit grounder into a Double Play

Oh yea, what would impress me ?

Less camera jitter/short shots, more character development, and tighter scripts/story/plot lines that don't seem rushed trying to cram 2 hours of 'Action' into a 46 minute prime time TV slot

Examples - the OTHER "New Shows" this Fall - Defenders and Blue Bloods, both very good and so far much better than "Book 'Em Dan O"

OK, this might help Five-0 ...

Bring in Patrick Jane for an episode, then they can all chase Red John around Oahu or an hour, or is that too 'Mental' for ya Brudda ?
