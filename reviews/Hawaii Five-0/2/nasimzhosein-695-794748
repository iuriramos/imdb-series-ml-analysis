I have been watching this show since the pilot in 2010, simply because of Grace. But the acting on this show is very poor. The two main characters are very fake and unreal in their day-to-day arguments and it shows very clearly.

Now that Grace has left the show, I won't watch it anymore.

Yes the stories are exciting and full of drama but the quality of the acting needs to improve.

The scenery of Hawaii is certainly very nice as well as the beach scenes but the acting just doesn't do justice to the show. 

Car chases are nice as well as the storyline and the high tech gadgets that are used.
