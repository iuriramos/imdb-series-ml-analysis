This is getting silly. Mcgaret goes intimidating people and beating the guts to extract information ? is this Latin America or middle east ? Is this the way US police work ? beating people till they confess? and one episoid where the kidnapper uses his car to do the crime, so from plate number they catch him...even a hi school kid would use a stolen car? sincerely this is a crappy set with fancy cars, camera's and dazzling colors. next ....and BTW: why every tuf guy has to be an Iraq war soldier ? what was the heroism when we widowed 800 thousand women and left 1.5 million orphans while searching for WMD that did not exist ? America CAN produce a hero who did not commit war crimes abroad, but Hollywood does not want to admit it...
