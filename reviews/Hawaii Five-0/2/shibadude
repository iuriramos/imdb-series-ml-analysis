I wrote a review a year so ago about this show. Skipped a few seasons and decided to pick it up again this year. Apparently CBS doesn't really care about the loss of viewers or they think the writers for this show are top notch. Far from it.

My biggest problem is the whinny little b***** Danno. Here you have the top crime unit for Hawaii and every episode that Danno is in all this character does is whine and whine and whine. Aren't these people supposed to be professionals in what they do. The writers must be as stupid as the day is long. They need to learn how to write a complete show without having to fill in time with Steve McGarrett and Danno's worthless chats. Doesn't matter if they're in that rolling Chevy advertisement vehicle or at a crime scene. It's getting old. As old as the other 30+ second same shots of Waikiki that they feel they need to have every episode. If I turn on this show and the Danno character is in the show I turn off the TV or watch something else. Just because it takes place in Hawaii doesn't mean everybody will watch it.

Hey CBS, maybe you should take a lesson from the people who do Criminal Minds or Blue Bloods. I see no fillers or waste of time scenes in those shows.
