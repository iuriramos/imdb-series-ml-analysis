I didn't expect this show to be totally like the original series because, hey, this is a new day. But what I did expect were story lines with meat to them. This new McGarrett & Danno look like some wane, unshaven slobs that have no grit. Danno is a hothead who is always going over the top. He also acts typical-Italian with the hand gestures. I thought he would say, "badda-bing" any minute! Where's the shock? Where's the attention grabber? Where's the suspense? It ain't here in this show! The white actors were all wrong! Wasn't McGarrett suppose to be part Hawaiian? He didn't even lead the team in this show. All he did was stand back and watch as Danno had tantrums. I think the show is fixable, but they'd better do it soon. The way it is now, I won't be watching it. My brain can't take it!
