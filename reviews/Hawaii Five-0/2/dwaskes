I was very disappointed with this new sequel of Hawaii Five O. Poor Jack Lord must be spinning in his grave. This new show's writers have obviously never had any contact with any real law enforcement agencies. The two protagonists look like a pair of skid row bums badly in need of a shave. The only time you would look like this in real life is when you went under cover. This new show is some clueless writer's fantasy of what an elite arm of LE should look like. The show's plots are too sophomoric and inane. It's too much CGI and special effects, and the banter is straight out of high school. The grade school set should love this new incarnation. Any resemblance to real life law enforcement is purely coincidental. CBS shouldn't let any modicum of reality interfere with this new offering. If they did it might cause enough interest for more of us to then watch it. Having been in LE most of my life I therefore give this show a big two thumbs down for a huge lack of credibility. Excuse me, I think I'm going to be sick.
