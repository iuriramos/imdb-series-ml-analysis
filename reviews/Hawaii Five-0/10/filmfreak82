So not a big fan of remakes, most times it seems they slap on an old title, throw on some familiar characters or lines and pretend its gold.

But I am liking this show. I was initially interested in the show because Alex O'Loughlin, the only reason I sat through the film "The Backup Plan". 

But the show starts with a bang and kept me interested. Yes there is some flashy cuts and slight melodrama in the beginning, but the rapport between McGarrett and Williams is great.

possible spoiler! AND FOR FELLOW GEEKS AND DORKS, the first episode has Alex O'Loughlin (former star from MOONLIGHT) and James Marster (Spike from BUFFY and ANGEL) two former Vampire roles in a fist match. Yay!!!!

along with Grace Park from Battlestar Gallactica and Daniel Dae Kim from Lost.

So as far as Casting goes I'm thrilled.

HAWAII FIVE-O has my attention for now, even though its a remake.
