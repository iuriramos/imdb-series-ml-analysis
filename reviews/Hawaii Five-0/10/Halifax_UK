To all the people who keep on commenting, that the original version was far better. To you I say, just keep watching the corny, over acted original version. This series is in no way directed towards the younger elements of society. I am 67yrs old, and think that this new version of Hawaii Five-0, is what the original series should have been. I agree with an earlier review, that there is more interaction between the characters, without the over acting of Jack Lord who in my opinion was vastly overrated, as was the original version. Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park perform with vigour, as they did in their respective Lost and Galactica series. I have never been a great admirer of Scott Caan, but in this series he is excelling himself. as for Alex O'Loughlin, what a great attraction for the ladies ( Unlike Jack Lord, who liked himself far too much to bother about anybody else ). Nobody in this series act as if the show would not survive without them, but gel together perfect. Don't worry that this new series will not stand up to the original, it does more than that, it exceeds it.
