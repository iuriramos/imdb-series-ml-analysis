I remember watching the old Hawaii five O with Jack Lord and I Remember it fondly. my sister had a crush on Jack Lord. Anyways. This show is a New Show it has nothing to do with Lord's show the names stay the same. It's a retelling or a reboot or a remake or however you see it. The new Show operates like the old one for all intents and purposes never happened. I like that and I can live with it. Steve McGarrett is leading military criminal investigator for the Navy S.E.A.L.S he handles all international crimes and terrorist activities. When Steve is brought home on a investigation into a weapons smuggling ring his father a police commander is murdered. McGarrett's case and his father's case inter wine fatally. McGarrett is offered a job by the Governor to head up a new task force to investigate corruption in the police forces and to handle crimes the other police forces cannot they will handle military as well as domestic cases . McGarrett refuses but when he meets a stubborn by the book cop who refuses to let him investigate his father's death he phones the governor takes the job and drafts Danny Williams into the task force so now Danny is working for him and not against him. That's the beginning. The Two leads share a intense dynamic chemistry together and create the most interesting show on TV today. I watched it and my wife caught one show and now she's hooked. This show deserves so much more then being compared to the old one it's so much more then That. It stands on it's own merits and does so very well. I like to think Jack Lord would be pleased.
