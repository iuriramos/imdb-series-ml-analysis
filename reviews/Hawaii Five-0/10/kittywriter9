This show is just so much fun. It's great entertainment and really, really beautiful. The scenery is gorgeous and so are the cast.

The cast have great chemistry together and Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan really shine. Their banter and friendship is the best since Starsky and Hutch.

The action is movie caliber and the production values excellent. The pilot set the bar high for ongoing weeks but they've lived up to it with only a couple of less than exciting episodes. Rare indeed for a procedural show. The show can be dipped in and out of like most cop procedurals but you're missing out if you do that. The character arcs are what are really interesting and their background stories. McGarretts especially.

Alex O'Loughlin is great here. He plays the stoic hero dealing with lots of problems in his life really well and as the show progresses we see him warm up and show more emotions as slowly he gets to know and trust his team.

Scott Caan is great as Danno, funny and warm you can't help but laugh at some of his lines. And Grace Parks and DDK just blend in so well with the team too. I love Grace in this and she is much stronger than in Battelstar Galactica. It's no surprise that Daniel is great as he was fantastic in Lost. 

This show gets better and better too and the latest eps have been awesome. Give it a go. Don't expect the original, expect a cross between 24 and Starsky and Hutch.
