I remember watching the original series when I was a child. My babysitter and me had a deal: if I behaved, she'd let me stay up an extra hour to watch McGarrett & Co. catch the bad guys. When I heard they were making it again, I had serious doubts...who could match Jack Lord and company? I didn't watch the show, but it showed up on TNT in syndication. I figured I'd watch it and that would be the end. SOOO wrong.....I'm not watching the original episodes until I catch up with the story lines. Alex O'Loughlin, Scott Caan, Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park (Kono was a secretary in the original series). Great casting, amazing acting and action and I DVR every episode so that I don't miss a second. Using 5-O as slang for cops...discovered where it came from, I'm guessing the OGs were kids at one time, and heard it as often as I did. Don't know why it didn't click earlier. Thrilled that they kept the original opening song, and logos, and the officers in the same positions as their names come up on the screen. A perfect mix of old and new, Dann-o never would have seriously argued McGarrett in the original, but the camaraderie between Alex and Scott is funny and endearing. Chin and Kono being related is great. I will watch this series right until the bitter end, and re-watch it again, thanks to DVR. I've missed many seasons already but am so ready to watch the next and the next until I catch up. Each episode is a evelation, and a more laid-back McGarrett is so much more fun to watch.
