I never watched the original so i can't compare them. All i know that the series is a fast pacing police series that has humor, perfect scenery and it never makes you get bored. It does not have the filling"what is going on on the next episode" that most the today series trying to achieve and at the end they lose the meaning. The series has a story of its one but it's not forcing you to see the next episode where nothing interesting will happen... Also the chemistry of the actors is excellent. As i said is a relaxing, fast pacing, with clever humor and beautiful photography TV series... If you want to be entertained See it without hesitation!!!
