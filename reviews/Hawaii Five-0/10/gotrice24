DANG THIS SHOW IS THE BEST!!!!!! First off, the plot line is excellent. I am on my toes throughout the whole show wanting to know whats happening.

Next, the actors they chose are the best!!!!! Steve Mgarret is perfect and a great actor, and also good looking. No Homo. This keeps the ladies interested.

Plus for all those guy fans, they included Grace Park!!!! Shes a cutie and a great cop.

I like how Steve Mgarret is a total bad ass too. He makes those suspects look bad.
