I manage to learn Hawaiian in every episode , Thanks to the show , the action is great , every actor works best to ensure their character is justified , so far as a fan i see no issues with the show. Keep up the good work and always know , Kenyan Fan love you all to bits. God bless You, (Did i mention i have a dream to play a love life of Steve McGerret? on the show ? ;-)
