This remake is completely perfect and should keep on airing. They have gotten a perfect female actress, Grace Park, and also come with comedy. 

Although some actors do not have good performance the storyline is consistent and makes sense. 

There are some suspense that i would like to point out. If you are a real fan of this series you get involved in it. Me myself got involved in the investigation. What i'm saying is, you know something is wrong with a suspect. Moreover they put some realistic characteristic of clues that the suspects do, for example in one of the episodes a suspect would shake his head to much revealing no confidence. 

A little improved love storyline would better this amazing series.
