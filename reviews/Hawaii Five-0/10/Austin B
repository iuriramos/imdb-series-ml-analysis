Let me first just say, Oh my God! I love this new series reboot. I've been a fan of Alex O'Loughlin since I first saw the pilot of Moonlight and I have been enjoying every part of his career since. The amazing thing about this show is that is constant fun and an A+ cast is the cause of this. Scott Caan is amazing. I first remember seeing him in Ready to Rumble, a fun movie that didn't fare well with critics. The chemistry between Caan and O'Loughlin is truly amazing and the fact that Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park are standing along side the two is another great thing. As of yet I haven't been able to find any outstanding issue that causes me to give this amazing show a low rating. This and Chuck are the two shows I look forward to every week.
