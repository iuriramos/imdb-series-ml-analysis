I haven't seen the original series, so i won't compare the new to the old. Hawaii caught my full attention from the first minutes of the first episode. The mixture of action, humor is just perfect for me. The characters are amazing, and i really love them all :-) and this is of cause due to the amazing actors! The dialogs and overall relations between Danno and Super Seal are hilarious (can you say bromance here? whatever you like, but i feel it) And why hide? I'm just in love with Steve :-) all his "taking off shirt" scenes are one of many things why you should see the series (shut up! i'm a girl, i have a right to watch TV-show because of the hot cast)). So together: hot cast, nice plot, intriguing storyline, hilarious dialogs and great action scenes = amazing TV-show "Hawaii 5-0". Really looking forward to the 4 season!!!
