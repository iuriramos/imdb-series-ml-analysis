Let's face it, new ideas are far a few between on the countless channels available to watch. I think remakes are a good idea as long as the original show's integrity is kept. I think they did a great job on the pilot setting up the show for just that. The updating done, rocks especially in the form of Grace park as Kono. Love the potential relationship between Mcgarret and dan-o. And daniel dae Kim is always consummate, he will do great as chin- ho. Let's remember, Hawaii five-0 was a lot of fun in my childhood and I think the young kids are entitled to have the same. With all the nonsense on the tube today, who could argue that this show isn't slick and fun. Summer is gone with shows like dating in the dark etc. Long live Hawaii and Hawaii five-0
