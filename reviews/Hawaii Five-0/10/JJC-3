Two episodes in and the new Five-0 is most assuredly a different animal than its prior incarnation.

And that is a good thing cause the old format would not play very well in this fast paced hi tech internet era.

The early interplay between the four characters promises to have a lot of exploration for back stories. Already McGarret & Williams have the great interplay of so many TV classic duos like Spock & Bones McCoy & Kramden & Norton just to name two.

All in all this promises to be a fast paced show with the usual modern day cop show formats but with that great Hawai'i backdrop! All in all a worthy 21st century follow up to an all time TV classic!
