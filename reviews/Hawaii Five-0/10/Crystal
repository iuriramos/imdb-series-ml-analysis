It took me some time to warm up to this show. The stories are good and all the stuff that goes on around that, personal stuff of the characters, is nice too. It took me a few episodes, then I began to like it more and more. What bothered me most at first was the cast. I'm not sure why, but somehow it didn't feel like a team. But after a few eps, the interaction and dynamics between the actors got really good (maybe it took them a bit to get the hang of it themselves too?) I like that there are other bigger names brought into the show, like Melanie Griffith, Terry O'Quin etc. Who doesn't work for me so much, is Cath. Her character is fine, as is the actress, but the girlfriend thing with Steve doesn't work. I don't feel any chemistry between them. It's more like sister & brother. Steve did have chemistry with Lauren German, who regretfully got written out of the series. I really like the acting & character of Danny, esp. love how great he is with kids. I just don't like the looks of him, lol. Short legs, short guy, large head, horribly obsolete haircut, just don't do it for me. (I'm sorry, I just happen to be a 'visual' person) But a good actor nonetheless. Who really seriously doesn't work for me, is the ME, Max, played by Masi Oka. I gather he's supposed be the cute, funny geek, but his English is so bad, half the time it's difficult to understand what he's saying. And since he's the ME, it's kind of important to understand the technical, anatomical things. I'm not keen on his acting either. The way he speaks, the inflection of his voice mostly, is weird. Sounds the way someone might pronounce English when they don't know the language and haven't a clue what they're saying. The cutest guy, not hunky cute, but cute cute, is Chi McBride. A big, giant teddy bear :)
