I am far too young to remember the original series, i was born in the late 80's. But i absolutely love the new series. It suits my taste. I love crime dramas with a a witty, fun cast leading the way. I forced my boyfriend to watch it the other night after much protest from him and he loved it. He can't wait for the next installment. It's witty, clever and makes you think about the crime they are trying to solve without becoming a headache. The banter between Steve and Dann-o is awesome, just like two guys talking to each other. The story lines are pretty much the same as any other crime drama but for they feel fresher, more exciting, like you have never seen them before. 

Just awesome, can't wait for the DVDs to come out.
