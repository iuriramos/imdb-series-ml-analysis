This Hawaii Five 0, is a lot better then the first one by far. There is a lot more action which makes it great to watch. Iam glad that they found a show that Alex O'Loughlin is not only good in,but that also enjoys being in. This suits him, he seems to be more at home on an island.I really like the whole cast that they picked for this show they work very well together for a group of people that have never worked together before. That is my mom's take on the show, I have never seen the original series. But I can honestly say Iam a huge fan, of this one! It has action, beautiful scenery and a lot of sexy people on it! But putting that aside it is an awesome show! We are really glad it was renewed for the fall season!
