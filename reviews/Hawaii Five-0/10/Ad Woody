I didn't expect to enjoy this, only knew one actor (Daniel from Lost, which is why I tried this) but this is a very cool show. Has a lot of action, crime and A LOT of comedy. My favorite 3.

The banter between Steve and Daniel is gold, the physical comedy reminds me of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia a bit. The episode they get stranded at sea is hilarious.

All the main characters are extremely likable, usually with every TV show there's always at least 1 character I don't like. Not just the good guys either, but the bad guys who appear over the course of the show are likable too, especially Sang Min, very funny character. I actually want them to evade whatever member(s) of the team are chasing them just so they'll re-appear later on. 

The whole thing with Steve's mom I thought was a bit boring though

I would of liked to have seen Sang Min and Kamekona in it a bit more, especially Sang Min. 

But yh, great show.
