I'm so happy that i started to watch Hawaii Five-O. All started when my brother told me it was good. As he have one of the most weird tastes when it comes to movies, i first doubted his recommendation. But he was right. 

This is one of the most stimulating series i ever watched. Normally i can tell what is to come in a movie, but this is outstanding work by the writers. I can't predict the outcome at all, and every episode that comes it just keep getting better and better.

Without telling to much, i think that the final episode is the greatest, it made me feel like a junkie that just want more and more. It's amazing! Very few things have made this to me, and i can nothing but recommend you to watch it, have fun, I'm positive you'll like it!
