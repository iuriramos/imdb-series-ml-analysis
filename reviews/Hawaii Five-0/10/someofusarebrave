Ye Gods, do I love this show. 

I never would have expected that I would. The sole female main character is young and thin and blatantly, brazenly physical; this generally seems a recipe for disaster, particularly in shows that are just starting out.

Somehow here this works. Somehow with this show everything just WORKS, for absolutely no reason aside from the fact that it is all carried out so darn well. The writing is taut and entertaining, the dialogue is witty and humorous during the perfect moments for it to be. The directors of every episode so far that I have seen have been excellent.

That in itself is quite the feat, and props must go to whomever deserves them. Meanwhile all of the actresses and actors seem perfectly cast, and capable, and genuine enough to be likable.

I have never seen a show that WORKS from the very beginning so well.

Keep doing what you're doing, folks. You do it exceptionally well.
