Steve McGarrett is responsible for creating a task force that will go above and beyond, in the name of justice. Together with a City cop from the mainland, Danny; falsely accused cop Chin Ho and fresh out of the academy officer Kono, they embark on a mission to make Hawaii safe from the criminals.

Most of the episodes can be deduced within the first 15 minutes. But its enjoyable because it is about action more than anything else.

Knightrider was a big let down, so when I saw the trailer for this I thought, its going to be terrible. But honestly, I'm hooked on this show..Yes, it is ridiculous, with prolonged fight scenes, made up science fiction nonsense (The stuff with the satellites). But I still think its better than most of the stuff thats on. Personally I would have opted for the show to be a continuation of the old, new characters maybe appoint Daniel Dae-Kim as the lead..But no Hollywood, likes to re-tell the same old stories...Anyways, its still a brilliant fun show..not to be taken to seriously.
