I love police action dramas and I love the gory bits as well I think this is defiantly for 18+ or for teens.There is wearing but not that much and they add comedy to it to. I defiantly recommend watching this if you are in to action and crime. The actors play good roles and have fantastic acting skills that makes you want to watch more and more until you cant stop. There is some cute moments, funny moments and sad moments that will sure to make you shed a tear or two. Halloween episodes are going to be good they have gory scenes and violence so if you like these you will like Hawaii five o. i would give 10/10 for its brilliant re boot.
