I love the character Catherine and even the character Kono, unfortunately I'm not that big of a fan of Lori but Jenna was cool:)

Since Kono is pretty much not in Hawaii 5-0 right now, I'm hoping it Catherine isn't replacing her but opening up her own spot on the team beside Kono. If Catherine is out of the show... I'm not sure I'll like the show as much anymore, that goes for Kono as well. At the moment I am just wishing that this show doesn't change to much in the character station. The past few shows I've been feeling good about especially since Catherine is getting more scenes in, which is good for her. Sadly Kono is gone more but I'm hoping she won't be gone for good, I was hoping to see Kono and Catherine kick some butt together :)
