The pilot episode had be hooked instantly. Talk about a way to get the viewer involved- throw them into the fray. Was sick for a week and was able to binge watch the first season on Netflix. Now I'm all caught up and patiently waiting for each weeks new episode. 

The show has elevated from your regular crime drama to epic adventure crime drama, at least in my opinion. The sweeping shots of the islands makes me wistful for home while using local actors and celebrities makes the show that much more believable (did anyone else crack up when seeing Dog the Bounty Hunter help the team out?!) 

I recommend the show for anyone interested in Crime dramas, gratuitous surf shots and some of the best grinds out there.
