When has a sequel approached or surpassed the brilliance of the original concept? Rarely, in fact I cannot think of a single instance. But seriously, when you make a sequel you should at least be a fan...force the writers to watch a season of DVDs so they at least have a clue. This is SO bad I don't even want to waste time on writing this intelligently.

In short, the characters are jokes...just some actor wannabes that no on the street would recognize, have no stage presence or unique personality or star gravitas. A quick example STEVE McGARRETT...he is and always will be JACK LORD no one can fill the shoes of the former Navy Commander. When I watch this young inexperienced punk say he is Steve McGarrett I wince...I shake my head...I wonder what the hell the writers and casting director were thinking. Yeah this no name actor is Steve McGarrett like I am Frank Sinatra...the guy playing the current Steve McGarrett couldn't put a pimple on Steve McGarrett's badge.

Thank GOD DVDs of the original episodes are available...with a 4K upconverter and a 4K LED projector I can watch the real Hawaii Five-O. Wow, how is it possible that the automobiles and scenery are better on the original fifty year old series??? Next time you want to make a sequel forget your trendy writers and get a few true hard core fans of the show to advise you. On the current series I honestly don't know and don't care who is who. At least the Asian woman is gorgeous.
