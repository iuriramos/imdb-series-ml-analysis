Initially the series showed real promise. Characters were a little stilted at times, but overall not bad. 

But season 2 started drifting into bad story lines and ridiculous contrivance. 

Season 3 has been even worse. I watch cop shows so I am used to them taking liberties with reality, but good shows do some research before filming. Who is supervising these scripts and why haven't they been taken out and shot. The absolute bottom has been an episode starring and directed by Peter Weller, of Robocop fame. The writing was atrocious, the acting amateurish, and the direction was terrible. The final scene was such sentimental slop that it was embarrassing to watch. I am done with this show. It needs to be canceled and replaced by a higher quality show, like reruns of the Teletubbies. Seriously, this show is BAD.
