Words cannot describe how bad this show is. Bad acting, ridiculous story that would work better in a cartoon. The action scenes are over the top-stupid. 

The lead is just an annoying douche-bag-pretty boy. The female Hawaiian cop is pissing me off. Daniel Dae Kim or whatever his name is, was ten times better in Lost. The only one that can act here is Scoot Caan. How this show ever got a green-light after that brain-dead pilot episode is beyond me. 

If you're a teenage boy and you like beautiful locations and good-looking leads and lots of action, and you don't care about decent acting and credible stories the this show is exactly what you want. 

Everyone else should just stay clear of this juvenile mess.
