It was great up until season 6 episode 10 when it just gets racist. A character is celebrating Hanukkah and goes up to the white lady with blond hair and talks smack. Kinda sick to see this going on, but right or left all of Hollywood is Jewish. It's funny because being part Jewish myself you just look at what's going on and shake your head. No one is fully Jewish, but we go around acting like when we're even slightly so we have to hate all white people and the other 80% of our genes. It's just ridiculous that everyone in this position feels the need to hate themselves and any person that considers themselves white. We're preaching about being anti racist while being the most racist people on the planet. This kinda of behavior is stupid and these shows are dumb for spreading the hate.
