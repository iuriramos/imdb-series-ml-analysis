So corny. Danno story? What kid tries to say their dad's first name before learning daddy? McGarret shows up and the governor just gives him carte blanche to do whatever the hell he wants no matter if it is legal or not? Beating a prisoner to get information out of him? Other guy is kicked out of police force because they say he took bribes, but he says he didn't then McGarret just let's him back in? Guy who's been convicted of taking bribes has a cousin who is now in the police force? How could she pass a background check if her cousin had been kicked off the force for taking bribes? My ten year old daughter could write better stories than this. I bet money that one of the story lines down the road is where Danno's ex-wife's husband turns out to be some kind of crime figure and Danno busts him and get's his wife back.....Watch and see, I won't be watching...
