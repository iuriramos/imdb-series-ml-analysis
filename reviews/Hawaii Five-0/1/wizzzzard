Are the directors only making bad series or what! Hawaii five-o, is so bad. the acting is so low, Danny is such a bad imitation of James Caan. And whats with "he/she is the murder" everyone they catch, gets told that he or she is the murder, every time. So many logic things, they cant even do, that never would go on in real life, its so bad directing and acting, I've seen 2 seasons, and, no more. So many things in this that is missing. A navy seal, well, is a bad ass in combat and more, but not in this series. Try and get real about it, make it more lifelike, get the details in order. Show sucks big time. I also wonder, why all the drinking, are they all alcoholics. Only thing i like, is how Danny act about his daughter.
