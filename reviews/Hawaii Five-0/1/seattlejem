the banter between Dano and Steve is boring! Straight men do NOT talk this way in real life, believe me.

The bullets fly on every episode, but of course, the main characters must have a special force field surrounding them, since they never get mortally wounded.

The first season was okay, but the show has gone way overboard and completely violates all laws of nature.

I've seen too many episodes now where bullets are flying, and yet the main characters can just pop out from behind a support beam, car door, or wherever, and not get hit by any bullets.
