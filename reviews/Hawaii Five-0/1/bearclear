I'm not sure where this show is going. It started off with a bang but it's now into its 5th season and going nowhere. Can't relate to any of the characters. Kono is a pouty Asian with a hawaiian name but has absolutely no local accent--she looks great in a bathing suit but is very limited as an actor. Chin Ho is a tad better as an actor but it's still hard to relate to him. Danno is the only one with real character but he's kind of a mess. Steve McGarrett looks good but has 0 charisma. The story line is unbelievable at times and then there's the big fat Hawaiian guy who reminds me of a minstrel act. Just can't get into it and I watch it if I happen to catch it but don't set aside time to watch it.
