/refers to Season 1/

I used to like most of films and dislikes most of series, but this decade in particular has reversed my opinions. Today, most films are targeted to teens and children, but most series are created for viewers able to see connections and ready for constant twists, flashbacks, intertwined events, etc. Of course, not everything is fresh and new, there is somewhat "rethinking and recycling", but the result is rather fine. 

All this also applies to Blindspot, with several references to "older" series from this century, but pleasant performances (nobody is really standing out, it is a team play) and versatile production/direction have made the series catchy to follow, there are multiple twists, no strict division into the good and the bad, and puzzles proceeding from the tattoos produce distinct and variable cases to solve. 

True, there was no performance with wow! feeling to me, but still, the series in question is a good entertainment, practically in line with Mr. Robot, or Blacklist, for example. For me as a practical guy, it is no problem that the role of sci-fi is limited, as I prefer the things solved using human mind, skills, and power, rather than by a mysterious outside force.
