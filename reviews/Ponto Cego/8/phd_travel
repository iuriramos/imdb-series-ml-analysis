The mannequin like Jaimie Alexander is watchable as the amnesiac who wakes up in a bag in Times Square covered with mysterious tattoos and no clothes. Her role is a bit similar to the one she played in 'Kyle XY' and now seems like a rehearsal for prime time. The main male lead actor Sullivan Stapleton looks convincingly serious but he is kind of common and forgettable looking for a lead role. Some one more distinctive and charismatic would have been a better pairing with Jaimie. There is something that makes you want to see how the mystery of her past comes to light and what her tattoos mean. The supporting cast doesn't seem that interesting so far but hopefully they will bring in some unique characters.

As with Greg Berlanti's other big success "Arrow" there is some Chinese conspiracy theme from episode 1. Maybe to make this marketable in Asia.

One of the more promising shows this season.
