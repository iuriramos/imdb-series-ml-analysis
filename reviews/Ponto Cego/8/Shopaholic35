I really am enjoying this show. I love the concept of a mystery being pieced together clue by clue. I was initially a little perturbed that as each clue/tattoo was deciphered they seemed to perfectly time it to save the day but then I decided not to look too closely into it. From that point on this show just got better and better.

It can be predicable at times but mostly I find myself engaged in each episode. The cast work really well together and are super talented at portraying their characters. So far I like them all excluding a couple of character flaws in some. The lead character is especially good and I give her full props for sitting through that much makeup everyday.

I think there is plenty more to explore with this show and find it's progressing nicely. As long as it continues to develop I can see myself watching this show for a while.
