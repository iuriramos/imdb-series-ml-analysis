SPOILERS! I like it, I really do. But it's just too similar to The Blacklist.

Let me break it down for you; Jane Doe. She's your Elizabeth Keen. She has the list of criminals that the FBI doesn't even know about. Government corruption. Kurt Weller, he's your Donald Ressler sort of guy. And then of course you have the hidden individual behind Jane Doe, that's Reddington.

It's going too fast. Just five episodes in and we have seen CIA/FBI corruption and dispute over "the girl". The Blacklist waited it out. Created a knowing of the characters before placing it all in a blender.But guess what the CIA wanted in The Blacklist? The girl, Elizabeth Keen, why is she so important to the 4th Most Wanted Criminal Raymond Reddington? Then there's the relationship. What's going on with Jane and Kurt? What's the deal with Reddington and Liz? What's their history? They've even got Daylight. That's essentially your Fulcrum.

But there is still the problem of, like many others stated that there's no personality of the characters, it's just your typical cop show humour and characterization.

But I do like it.

And hopefully with a few more episode it'll evolve into it's own identity and not that of following The Blacklist.
