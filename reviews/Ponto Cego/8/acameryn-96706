From the first episode, I knew this was going to be a amazing and very interesting show. Mysterious girl found in a duffel bag in Times Square covered in tattoos and no idea who she is, let's just say the plot is what drew me in the most.

The first couple of episodes were good. Viewers get a vague but understandable look at what was going on and it was easy to see who was who and the history certain characters had with each other. That is until you continue to watch the show. Within a mere six or seven episodes, I began to find myself getting a bit confused and unsure where the storyline was headed.

Characters began turning on each other, secrets were coming to light, and our lead character Jane Doe is getting a better look into her past. A past she didn't necessary expect to see but that's besides the point. At the beginning like I said I was practically hooked but as time went on the show began to lessen and lessen. The script was getting worse, repetitive and I found that every episode was about a unexpected crime matching one of Jane's tattoos. On top of that I found myself literally hating some of my favorite characters (JANE TO BE SPECIFIC). But I kept watching. (AS YOU KEEP WATCHING, YOU WILL HATE JANE MORE AND MORE BECAUSE OF HER CRAZY DESICSIONS I hoped that if I stayed loyal to the show, it would get better. For the most part it did and I'm happy I kept watching. For this type of show in particular, you must watch it to determine if you like it or not. I held off on watching it for a long time because of all the mixed reviews but in the end it turned out to be an amazing show with great characters. Not every episode starts off interesting but by the end, it will bring a bunch of secrets and important plots to life. Personal I would say it's a must watch!!!
