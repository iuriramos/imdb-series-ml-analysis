OK when i watch this show, besides been hooked, i cant think in "Prison Break" idea of the body tattoo that leads somewhere plus "John Doe" idea of someone who doesn't know who he is (in this case she) have been merge to create this show... its not bad really The show is great i love the "one tattoo - one episode mystery solved) dynamic because that gives the show plenty of time for at least... four seasons? The problem this days is the amount of episodes i mean 23 episodes for one season? They should leave Season 01 with 10 eps (the mid-season cut) then Season 02 made the remaining full 13 eps...

Bur the show is good anyway...

Watch it is nice...
