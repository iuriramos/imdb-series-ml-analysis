Wow can't believe the negative reviews this show is getting! Can't agree with any of them. 

Got hooked after the first 10 minutes of the pilot. Pretty original if you ask me. Specially the start on Times Square. I don't want this to end but I need to know where it's going, who she is, who did this to her and so on. 

If you require immediate answers then no maybe this show is not made for you. But if you like a ride where you don't know what's coming, when it's coming, who is doing this and so on, then yes this is made for you. The story is compelling. Casting is done great as they didn't cast 'big names' which for me gives it a more believable twist. Acting is convincing and script is non-BS. It's just good entertainment. Can't wait for 2nd season!
