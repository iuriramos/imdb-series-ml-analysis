I cannot really comprehend all the 2-3 star reviews, while blaming this show being a montage of several other shows. Yes, you may have seen this kind of setup before. But why is that preventing this to be a reasonably good show? If all good show has to be brand new, in all aspects of screen writing and story line layout, why are you so fascinated about the record-breaking Avatar? Pocahontas on alien planet, right? Back to Blindspot. It is fun to watch a tattoo covered martial beauty walk around city busting bad guys. Ain't it? The story is not very new per most reviewers noted, but so do all police/FBI shows. What's interesting is all people want to know why she is there, and who she really is. Sometimes I do feel they are extremely lucky to catch all the bad guys as they wish (so far). But hey, that's how police show goes. Yes it is a little dumb from time to time. But what I am doing while watching the show, is just killing some time. And this show is just that: sexy, funny, some action, some stupidity, perfect for me to relax myself and have some beer. If I want to exercise my brain, I'll do my quantum physics study.
