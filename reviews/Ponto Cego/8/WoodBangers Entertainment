Giving thought that this is a review on the Pilot, they're many things I should mention. Pilots are typically the best sort of introduction to what it to come, so yes things can seem a bit rushed from time to time. Also not all actors or actresses may seem to have a good grip on their parts and many more things like this play into the mix. In this Pilot for the TV Series "Blindspot", they did do a very good job in the presentation.

This Pilot and show had me at Tattooed Female who can kick some ass. The concept in which gets pitched in this pilot looks promising, it has action, it has a fairly good cast, and a pretty interesting story-line. I do feel it will be a show that I'll watch till the end. Great stuff.

If you're a fan of shows that are sorta fast moving with action, and a fairly action based drama scripting then this is one for you.
