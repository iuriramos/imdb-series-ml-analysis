As previously pointed out in these reviews, Blindspot is suffering from more than a few of the titled problems; What is it with FBI shows and stupid scripts? don't you people do research? Blindspot is not quite as dumb as Quantico, but it's a close competitor! The entire premise is just stupid. Are we to believe that the FBI is in the habit of involving trainees and victims in it's investigations, in the field? Really? As if that weren't enough, Jane Doe gets a gun in episode 3 - not just any gun, but an FBI issued firearm Wha-What!? Uh huh, yeah, that could happen, right?

From start to finish, every episode is filled with complete nonsense and canned script, e.g. "Stay with me!" as someone dies (OMG). The effort to include all possible references to terrorist threats, drones, special forces, CIA, blah-blah, is sad and repetitious. The "computer girl" is equally unimpressive and grates on my nerves. 

Finally, is the FBI really this incompetent? These guys can't catch a criminal (he's too fast), can't follow a lead (computer girl does it all), can't shoot, and can't fight. Annoyingly, Agent Reade reminds us every episode that involving a victim/citizen in a law enforcement investigation is uhm, WRONG.

I can't imagine I can watch the entire season...
