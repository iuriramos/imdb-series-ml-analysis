Every episode Jane says "This is the only lead we have to figure out who i am" or "We lost the only lead to figure out who i am" or something along those lines. Agent Weller is always sorry for everything. I wanted to write more about him, but there really isn't much more to him. He fights, shoots when its his turn to shoot, takes a hit and wins at the last moment and then he is sorry. (Feels like i have seen it before)

Its not remotely believable that one of the biggest agencies in America only has 3 agents available and that no one speaks Chinese.

Watched 3 episodes and it feels like i have watched 3 to many
