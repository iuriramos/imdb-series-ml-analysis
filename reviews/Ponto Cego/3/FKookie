Rating 5 = I keep the show.. Rating 4 - 3 = Watch and Resell.. Rating 2 and below = rail at myself for wasting my life ;_)

Storyline is promising but the series itself is quite mundane.. it is turning out to be one of those series that i will only watch when there is a lull in the good.. 

Cast.. Sullivan Stapleton is fine.. the rest of the cast forgettable.. but Jaimie Alexander beautiful as she is.. her aggro Jane always running off to do her own thing irks me some.. and btw suffering from amnesia does not mean suffering from a lack of facial expression..

it would be sad if there is a season two when other great series like Allegiance with a great cast and great story did not make the cut.. it makes us wonder how these series make the cut behind the scenes.. maybe there will be a truly honest show made on that one day..
