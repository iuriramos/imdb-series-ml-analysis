I tried too hard to like this show, and that's on me. IMDb reviewers were clear in their warnings and I would have benefited from reading them before putting effort into finding a mindset that made this show watchable.

7.6 stars with over 35k votes, it turns out is not a valid reason to turn off my brain and indulge without looking further.

Is it more reasonable to believe the executives who green-lighted this insult to intelligence are astonishingly incompetent or that they are willfully and accurately targeting their demographic? To me, they're saying if you're smart enough to hook up a Roku, you wouldn't be watching NBC anyway; and I kind of feel like they're giving me the finger.

It's easy to beat the show up for it's lack of originality, plot structure, acting, believablity, etc. But what caught me off guard was how the IMDb ratings have devolved. It's not something I believe should be campaigned against or can be changed, it's just a fact that a you cannot see a high number and attach any expectations to that.

I learned my lesson with Blindspot. The 3 stars I gave are what I believe it earned. I didn't inflate like some admit, to offset what I thought was unfair, or give a flat 1 star because the show "wasted my time" and I'm mad.
