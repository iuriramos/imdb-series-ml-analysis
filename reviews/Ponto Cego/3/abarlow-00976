For goodness sake can't they hire cameramen that don't have Parkinson's disease. The shaky cam work is positively terrible and distracts from enjoying the story, only way I can watch it is to NOT watch it, just listen to it. Also far too many close up shots, which make the movement of shaky cam worse. Get real, get a new producer that has some idea how a scene should be filmed. The story is reasonable and easy to absorb, but there is no point in trying to balance on a trampoline while filming the episode. Clearly some arty farty filming school is promoting this shaky cam rubbish as a special "technique", but in reality, most people just get balance sickness when watching scenes filmed this way, making some producers think that they have found the magic way to make you feel as if you are experiencing the real action. Well I am sorry to disappoint, but that is just not what is happening.
