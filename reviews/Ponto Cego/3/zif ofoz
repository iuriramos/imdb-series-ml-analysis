You know something is out of sort when 30 minutes into the show you feel like an hour has past. It's been my experience that if something doesn't engage the viewer within the first 20 to 30 minutes of a show then the show (for me) is at an end. And here in Blindspot that very thing didn't happen - I could not connect with any element of the story.

First I found the behavior of Jane Doe mostly laughable and the FBI reaction to her behavior as comical. Suddenly Jane Doe becomes 'boss lady' when she exerts herself, Investigator Weller's lower jaw teeth look weird and just dominated all his closeups, and the Chinatown scene where Jane Doe beats the crap out of 3 men and breaking windows & furniture, and nobody upstairs hears a thing! Its just comical and boorish. I could not finish the first episode.

Bad script (no memory of anything in her life and they are going to get her a menu to choose something to eat, remember that?) Think about it! Then they run off to Chinatown and she's their only interpreter available? No!
