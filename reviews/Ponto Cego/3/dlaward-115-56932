There is only one thing is good and I like about this show ''The Idea''. Nothing else seems good, Acting is unprofessional, script is so weak, same method for every time. The only thing kept me continue watching the show was to see how it is ended.... It seems like they spent a lot of time for making title with good music, but inside the show is poor for even music... It looks very cheap for me.. I still don't understand a few things: How could they make 14 episodes so bad??!! Someone should say something... How could it get 8 or 7 stars for rating?.... 

I didn't know that agents of the FBI are so childish....
