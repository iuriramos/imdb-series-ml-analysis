If you were to ask me what's the best series out there right now, I'd have to say "Blindspot." Then, why am I giving this a 3/10? Easy: It's the perfect series... for Rifftrax, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Cinematic Titanic, etc. If your intention is to watch this seriously, just go ahead and keep looking. Perprexingly bad acting and a predictable plot, full of "plot twists" as surprising as Tuesday coming after Monday. Moreover, an average 42min runtime for each episode is excruciatingly painful. Everything in each episode feels incredibly contrived. The sexual tension between the main characters is plain predictable. Anyway, I'm pretty sure you'll find something better to do with those 42 minutes.
