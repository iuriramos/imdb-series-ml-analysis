only watching because it has Jamie Alexander in it since i watch agents of shield and she's in a few episodes of that and also in the thor movies as lady sif thought i'd give this at least a chance .

it's sort of like the blacklist but a low budget version really bad copy of it almost the exact same storyline but instead of a blacklist they have tattoos don't get me wrong there's some good action mostly on Jaimie Alexander ( jane doe ) part in it . the acting however is cringe worthy . and the supposed chemistry between jane and Weller is so uncomfortable to watch it's like they are trying way to hard . most of the supporting characters are their just as fillers
