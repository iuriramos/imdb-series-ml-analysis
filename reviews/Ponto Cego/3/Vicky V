I don't wanna be a hater but I really tried watching this. Thought to myself, it will get better. It always gets better, hell the plot is interesting enough from what can be gathered in the first few minutes especially with our our attention captured in the very beginning (hey no spoilers from me).So what was it that was so bad? Okay, I can't write much coz I couldn't even get to the 2nd episode. Maybe one of reasons was that I expected too much especially after seeing the poster. Maybe 'twas... oooh I could live that.. so lets skip the desert shall we? It wasn't the dialogue or the transitions. I realized I was never going to get past the poor dreadful acting! Its like having a really beautiful knife but its blunt. Damn shame could have been a really good show with the likes of 24, Prison Break or Homeland. The poster was nice though.
