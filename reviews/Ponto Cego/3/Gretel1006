What a disappointment. I was quite intrigued by the trailers for the show and I actually found the first episode to be pretty good. The body covered in tattoos is pretty cool and I like that she doesn't have any memory of who she is. I felt this set up the show to have an interesting story line (even though it is reminiscent of other show/movies like Prison Break and Bourne). 

But then the second episode happened and that is where it completely fell flat for me. The acting and scripting felt so contrived. I started to feel irritated at the show. I like when I watch something and I get immersed in it, but Blindspot made me so aware of the actors trying to act out a character. I hope that make s sense... 

The writing was obvious, such as it was easy to pick up on when a character asked a question in order for an answer to be given to provide needed information for the viewer. This made the conversations feel so fake. This kind of information needs to be shared more naturally. 

Another disappointment with the second episode was that it became apparent that they are going down the path of having a "mystery" each show to solve. So Blindspot is a formulaic procedural show where the actors are to save the world (or a portion of if) each week based on information that they just happen to miraculously interpret from the gal's tattoos. What a bore.
