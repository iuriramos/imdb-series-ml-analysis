I've seen a lot of promos for "Blindspot" so I'm assuming that NBC is betting on this new fall TV show being a break-out hit. Sorry, "Blindspot" is mediocre at best. It tries way too hard to be something new when it's really just a mash-up of earlier TV shows -- "Prison Break," "The Blacklist" -- and a little kick-ass cop show added in. And while there are similarities between this show and "The Blacklist" (a female lead who seems too attractive to be believable and a confusing plot that will evolve -- unravel? -- as the season progresses), "The Blacklist" has James Spader, who could read off the ingredients in a cereal box and still manage to entertain. Unfortunately, "Blindspot" has no such captivating actor or actress. Additionally, the dialogue in "Blindspot" really doesn't help. No banter, no personality. Just clich√© cop show dribble.
