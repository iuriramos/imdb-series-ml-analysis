Must we be subjected to these clich√©d, badly written, wooden acted nonsense shows? I shudder at the budget of this piece of schlock.

I was looking for something new but its just so patronising to be fed this drivel.

The reason the Martian is kicking it? Its fantasy sci fi that is believable. Nothing about this show is remotely believable and i find myself having to shut it down before I reach the end of an episode. A full episode is just too long to suspend even the remotest link with reality. Everything hinges on lucky guesses, coincidences and tenuous links. I can't warm to a single one of the characters.

I've tried, 4 episodes.... nup. Bleh. I'd rather gargle liquid cat poop than put myself through another episode of this schlock.

Trashy nonsense.
