The basic plot/idea of the series (as far as one can see after the pilot) seems to be interesting and certainly suspenseful but the acting is at best mediocre. Sullivan Stapleton was already not really convincing in 'Strike Back', even as 'reckless cowboy soldier' but Jaimie Alexander's main quality seems only to be good looking. Otherwise she's absolutely not qualified for an action role (female 'Seal', are you kidding me, can't even handle a handgun properly, not to speak about the 'wooden' fighting scenes) like the role she has in this series. Secondly, it's pretty -not to say totally- unlikely the authorities would allow her to be involved (as a 'Jane Doe') in counter-terrorist activities but that fits in the whole weak picture of how the FBI is handling the situation. So, not a convincing start but I won't give up on them just now and will watch another episode. It can only get better ...
