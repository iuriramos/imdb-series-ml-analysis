A woman who can't remember her past and with special skills (a la Jessi - Jamie Alexander's role in Kyle XY), and mix that with her being an outsider with critical information, via her tattoos (a la Michael Scofield in Prison Break), to future crimes and thereby becomes a de facto member of the FBI (a la Raymond Reddington in Blacklist) . 

Make it worse by pushing the Hollywood agenda that wants us to believe we're all equal - a world where little women can kick the butts of guys twice their size, a lesbian black woman somehow merited being in charge of the unit (above every other qualified agent) and voila! Another piece of crap show whose sole purpose is to push a leftist wet dream of how the world should be.
