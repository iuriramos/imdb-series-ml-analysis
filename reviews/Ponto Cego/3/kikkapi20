I would like to blame the acting on the actor, but it just may be the director, or the writer. No, it's the actor. In any case the raw emotion from the lead male is usually nonsensical. He raves at his boss like a spoiled child, and acts bipolar most of the time. In real life that kind of behavior gets you fired, reassigned, or committed. I kind of feel sorry for Ms Alexander as she has been tasked to play a person who is highly functional, but has zero idea on who, what, when, why, how etc. Just how did they pitch this story and character to her to get her to sign off on this? The premise is interesting and unique, but the two main actors are a bit stiff.
