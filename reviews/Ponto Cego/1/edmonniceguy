The only good thing going for the show is the beautiful tattoo woman. Other than that I would not have wasted my time!

Spoiler alert, First off it does not make sense that a citizen of China would come to the US and blame them when his mother died in a Chinese prison camp because his petitioned the US government for help, would he not instead blame the Chinese government and take action there? 

Secondly - plastic explosives in a tunnel and no structural damage? nice I guess the writer of Star Gate Atlantis thought he was still writing for that series, might I suggest that they revive that series and put this budget towards it and give the tattooed woman a role in it. 

I think Blindspot is the perfect name for it since the NBC execs forgot to check the show and its about crash hard!
