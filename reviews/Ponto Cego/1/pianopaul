The girl in tattoos is interesting to look at but the dragon tattoo girl had better dialog to work with. Some ridiculous things that make this a show I'll never watch again. Rather than go immediately and help a naked victim emerging from a bag, Homeland Security pulls weapons and screams at her to get on the ground (they're not really that cowardly are they?) If the massive amounts of drug are in her system, how does she remember getting out of the bag? Shouldn't she be in a hospital? They've determined 'she knows music but doesn't know the Beatles' - sort of an odd test, how much time did they spend on that one, 'here I'll play some music - do you know that's 'music'? Which of these songs - sorry you don't know what a 'song' is - okay which one is the Beatles?" "Try these 2 drinks one is coffee one is tea, tell me which one you like best?" Don't warn her it might be hot. She slugs them both down - "That one tastes like grass clippings" - She knows what grass clippings taste like? Detectives that don't have flashlights in a dark building. New York detectives that don't have a translator going into a building they know from a Chinese script address. The main 'Archer' FBI guy shouts at the Chinese speaking people, "I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU!" Other than the shouting parts, the main 'Archer' FBI guy mumbles all his dialog. Throwing a bomb down a subway tunnel - phew, no problem there, right? Only 3 cops available to search for a bomb on 14 acres around the Statue of Liberty. How do you get to the top of the Statue in 15 seconds? The tattoo girl can't keep her hands off 'Archer' - I think a 15 year old gamer wrote this and his Hollywood daddy green-lit it.
