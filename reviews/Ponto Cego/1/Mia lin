As a big fan of the criminal investigation TV shows, these several days I heard so much about the show, everybody is talking about how awesome and how great it is! I can't wait to see it, when I finally saw it, I am so shocked by the discrimination in it. In this show, Chinese is the stereo type as the violent people who beats up his wife, who attacks the women, who is terrorist, you name it. I was so shocked but I still finished it to see if there is any explanation about those people just is an example, but no. The logic is so chaotic, it shows the writer didn't do any homework about the different Chinese local accent they use in the TV show. First of all, the tattoo on Jane Doe's body is Chinese character, she is speaking the Mandarin in the FBI office, when they go to the Chinatown, the guy in the apartment speaks Cantonese, then actually they are talking about Wenzhou accent, this is just the language part, the Chinese characters will still be the same. Can the writers do some homework if it is such a big show? Talking about the stereo type, which of course, even the suspect is a GE engineer, and he of course lives in small apartment like a rat and tried to tear down the stature of liberty using the bomb. I actually get used to see the Chinese was described as the lower class people in all kinds of movies and TV shows, but I am never so angry, disappointed and sad that now Chinese was described as the terrorist. I never feel any discrimination in my personal life, we should not judge people by their colors. For the sad situation, the kind of show is so popular, this kind of mindset would not help different people to know each other, to understand each other, but build up the wall between each other. This is just the first episode of the show, I don't know how it will go, I know my voice is small and my review probably would not mean anything, but I just want everyone to know that this discrimination is really really a bad thing and will hurt people's feeling.
