I have been a huge fan of this show since it started, but the finale was a huge disappointment. All of Jane's action were stupid and ridiculous!!! Given all of her flashbacks about her relationship with Oscar...she wants to bring him in and then ends up killing him!!!!!!..someone she once loved!

Then she wants to return to the FBI and make things right. How absurd!! This was a total let down. Kurt finding Taylor was the only thing that made sense. It's good that the rest of the team will finally learn about what Mayfair was involved in. To sum up my feeling about the show-I don't think I'll be tuning in when the show returns!
