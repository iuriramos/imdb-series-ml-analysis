It's such a shame when the writers are allowed to insert their liberal agenda propaganda into an episode and ruin the entire series for your conservative viewers. Tonight's stab at conservative views on Planned Parenthood within the story line was not necessary for the story. Especially the lie about it "saving millions of women's ability to get health care". Many other issues could have been identified as justification for the characters to accept the spy program without choosing and then justifying that propaganda. Deleted now from the DVR. Would have rated about an 8 prior to this. Good actors, fast paced but just can't cope with these not so subtle implants pushing such a heinous agenda such as selling baby parts.
