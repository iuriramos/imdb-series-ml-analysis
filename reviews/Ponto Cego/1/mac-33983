I do not understand the level of thinking that went into this. Either it was designed for 12 years or else it was written for a very unassuming audience..

The acting/script is poor to say the least... Sullivan Stapleton is apparently capable of only two facial expressions : A 3000 yard emotionless stare or a 5000 yard emotionless stare, neither of which is even remotely convincing.

Jaimie Alexander was brought in purely for her looks because I can't see many other signs of talent... I understand her character should be confused but that doesn't mean it has to be pathetic...

The other roles are so insignificant that cardboard cutouts would have been just fine... again all characters lack depth. 

It's almost as though the script/character creation was written by a computer program, completely devoid of emotion..

The series revolves around an incredibly poorly organised script in which each tattoo amazingly brings our heroes into completely over the board investigations, eventually resulting in being able to save New York from ultimate destruction within a very short period...rinse and repeat...

The plot appears to simply pull sequences/scripts/ideas from every other reasonably good series from the last 10 years.... but without managing to do it successfully.. there is very little coherence, nothing comes as a surprise and the action is simply missing.

It's Prison Break, 24 hrs, CSI, etc melted into a pot of nothingness. It is extremely difficult to find anything even remotely good to write about the series, it just doesn't hit the mark... the writers have not managed to create tension or depth, it's very much a sequence of superficiality.

The trailer looked great but the pilot turned out to be a poorly scripted/budgeted B Movie and from there it has only gone downhill...

I truly hoped that this was going to become a super series but unfortunately it has turned out to be sorely disappointing....
