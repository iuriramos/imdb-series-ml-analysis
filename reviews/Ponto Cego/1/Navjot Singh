This is probably the worst shows on TV right now. I won't say anything about the story. It started off good and showed real promise. I mean who wouldn't get excited about the story of a girl who has no memory but has clues on her body regarding crimes and criminals which nobody knew about. For the first few episodes, it was all exciting and I kept waiting for the larger story to reveal itself. 

But then, the repetition kicked in. Each episode is literally becoming the same. The plot is totally falling apart. Writing just keeps getting worse. Acting is bad as well. There is zero chemistry between the lead pair. 

My advice? Save your precious time and use the 42 minutes doing something productive than wasting over this crap.
