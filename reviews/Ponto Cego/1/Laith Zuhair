I watched the whole first season, and i can say that this show is mediocre level. The acting is not that good, and the story has a lot of holes in it.

Because this show is 23 episode long, it is expected to have a lot of filler stuff and stupid drama.

If the show was 13 episodes instead of 23 i think it would be better and have a lot of action sequences instead of the drama like for example Daredevil & Luke Cage & Jessica Jones...etc

They need to do better at this time, as there are a lot other shows better to watch.
