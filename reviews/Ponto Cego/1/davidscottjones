This has to go down as the most inane and laziest script ever written for TV. There is the story line that as they storm the Statue of Liberty its point out that there is only 3 FBI agents going to comb the island to which JANE gets to go because she speaks Chinese. I mean in all of NYC there is only 3 FBI agents to handle the situation. WTF? What happened to all the FBI agents or NYPD tactical squad? Its just not addressed figuring the viewers will just accept the situation as the writer wrote. Then, the Chinese dissident is left alone in a hospital and the FBI does not have the guy under guard. What if he just walked out? Lame lame lame. And those two examples was just the tip of the iceberg. Worst writing/story structure I have ever seen. These guys should be striped of their WGA membership. I was looking forward to seeing the story arc of the story. However, I'm afraid this inane writing will be in every episode so I'm done. Its going to go off the rails and not goanna waste my time with such poor story structure and writing.
