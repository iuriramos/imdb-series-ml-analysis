This show was interesting then it fell for a lot of bad stereotypical junk.

The blonde girl. FIRE HER. Her whole character is so FAKE, and awful. you could have done anything, anything better than this trash. for a professional working for the government she is clearly not capable of performing those duties. she falls for pitfalls only a novice would fall for. and she is another no backbone filler character. her incompetence is so bad.

The second big problem is she keeps getting every answer... some answers you never get, this isn't a fairy tale, and to tie her into the team in some stupid relationships, pass.

the ncis, csi fakery is also bad. let it die, the 90's and 2000's killed it for everyone. stop beating this dead horse.

The cost of production has dropped even more. INFINITE AMMO! bad guys die from a shot to the leg and don't make noises. made a bomb from bleach then shot a plastic container... I've heard of escapism but come on. tactical positioning is garbage. no shots through walls...
