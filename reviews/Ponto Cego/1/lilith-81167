NBC states this is the "Number 1" show on network TV today, which just shows you they must be blind themselves. This show is a poorly acted, poorly written clich√©d mess. SPOILER ALERT for anyone who hasn't seen the first episode: A duffel bag appears in Times Square; thinking it might be a bomb, the FBI moves in on it, guns drawn, until a naked woman covered in tattoos emerges. Surprise, she has no idea who she is or how she got there. Surprise, she has no idea why she's covered in these tattoos, and surprise, instead of treating her as a trauma victim, they arrest her! Later they determine, based on one of the tattoos, that she's actually a trained Navy SEAL. Right. Because only a SEAL could have that particular mark. I just about turned off the TV right there. One moment she's quivering with fear and panic, the next she's some martial arts expert, but then goes back to being a clueless whiner. But then they give this amnesiac a place on their team- a team led by some guy who has no idea what a razor is, apparently. Sorry NBC, but the FBI does have a dress code, and his unshaven look isn't rugged or hot...he just looks like a slob. As far as the character he's portraying, could he be more one-dimensional?
