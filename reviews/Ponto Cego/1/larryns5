One of the dumbest TV drama shows I have ever watched (I don't watch much and this show is an example why). I watch about 15 mi. for the 1st time and had to stop the acting was stiff and amateurish and scrip was juvenile.

AND 

1. UV light will only kill bacteria on the surfaces that it hits. You cannot sterilize people's skin with UV light while they are dressed (O My! O My!)

2. Botulin kills by causing muscle paralysis. It blocks neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neurons. (O My! O My! Big words), NOT BY causing hemorrhaging!!! 

If the show has a science adviser fire or listen to him/her. If it doesn't have one it should GET A SCIENCE Adviser!!!!

I'm tired of correcting the garbage science my student see on TV drama shows. the producers should Have some integrity and honesty. Their conduct contributes to the low science score American student have as compared to other countries.
