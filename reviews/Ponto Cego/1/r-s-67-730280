One of the worst serieses i've ever seen in my live.Beginner actors seriously , and what a Coincidence that they discover the tattoo half an hour before the attack or whatever ,Okay let me till how a typical episode of blindspot looks like: First of all the genius patterson discover what the tattoo refer to then she calls them saying "Come to the lab i found something" after that she explains her spectacular way of how she know what the tattoo means "which is really silly "then all of sudden this tattoo is related to an accident or a criminal that the team know then jane look at them and says "somebody wanna fill me in " then they till her who is this guy or what is this accident then the brave kurt willer says " lets go and get him " and they stop the criminal 2 min before the explosion and everybody go home. 

Yes reader it's a children's play + this is how every episode looks like , congratulation you have finished the blindspot series!
