This TV show is really bad.

The man is a super hero : man of action , smart , can disarm a bomb , work on Intel.

He is followed by 2 transparent sidekicks , one of the 2 is the classic "i hack the world in 1 minute" nerd and other is the classic "formely ghetto" black buy.

Nobody in USA speak Chinese but the heroin.

The instant the superhero guy arrive to the hospital say his name and the doctor claims 'Wouho it's you?' . Yeah of course everyone is fan of a FBI agent what a turd.

This is REALLY bad.

How the f.... this got 8 on IMDb ?
