My wife and I really liked this show up until the latest episode (11/9/15). I don't ever write reviews, but this one ticked me off enough. They threw in so many current social issues and showed their obvious bias toward those issues. 1) An unarmed black kid gets shot by corrupt, white police officers. 2)The director is a lesbian. 3) A gay football player is blackmailed by said corrupt cops 4) A sympathetic salute to the "good deeds" of Planned Parenthood. I just wanted to watch the show because I liked the action and plot twists. I am sick of having the LGBT card thrown in my face every time I watch a show! We get it! You want to be gay? Fine. That's your choice, but I don't understand why every show or movie nowadays keeps including it at some point or another. Then you want us to feel sympathetic to Planned Parenthood?! Really?! Administrators and workers have been caught red-handed on video describing the "best" ways to cut up babies (or fetuses if the word baby offends you too much) and SELL the tissue to make a profit!!! That's illegal. Plus, they are on video for talking about how to dodge the legality of some of the procedures to be able to better extract things like the brain, liver, heart, etc. You put a sympathetic spin in your show towards this organization and I'm suppose to disregard the absolutely abhorrent practices they have admitted to doing?! Are you out of your mind?! Keep the show entertaining and viewers will be happy. Quit including your biases on social issues that have no place in your show!!!!
