I watch the first episode and not even 7 minutes in and i've already been blindsided by so many flubs and imperfections its a wonder that I wasn't watching a B movie. Then I realized, I was. I was watching a really expensive, multi season B movie and I was at peace. This show has some alright action scenes but, like every review of this you see on this website, suffers from bad writing, Bad acting, and is just a good concept done in a tired manner.

I'm gonna tell you about a specific part that I believe represents the show perfectly as a whole.

They enter this Chinese dude's house and after they talk to bad-guy's roommate and enter bad-guy's room. The three friggin' FBI Agents see a bunch of science equipment and they immediately just start saying that its meth like they have no idea how bombs work and they just got done watching breaking bad and they think they're experts on the subject. Then one of the dudes finds sawdust, notes a particular smell and then instead of coming to the obvious conclusion that sawdust and bad smells are a part of making bombs, scans it with a thingy. Not one of the three agents in that room could figure out the literal first thing about making bombs. Including the 1337 HAXXOR girl who could have just googled "Sulfur smell and Sawdust".

And that just sorta goes on for the whole show. Either they make a wild assumption that's right or they stand in a room and fumble over common knowledge.

Another good example of the quality writing in this show, we roll back to before they go to badguy's house and they discover a tat behind her ear that just so happens to have an address to his house and "Today's Date" Pretty lucky that they stopped it in time, right? 

why would they just tattoo the day they carry out their plan? Wouldn't they want it to y'know... go off without this exact thing happening?

If you think this show is good you're legitimately stupid. Objective fact.
