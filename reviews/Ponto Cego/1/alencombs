***The Review May Contain Spoilers, if the Script hasn't spoiled it enough for you**** The show's only good part is the very beginning that only showed the girl found in a bag. I wondered why more wasn't shown, and now I see why.

The script is extremely bad with hokey dialogue and one dimensional Marty and Mary Sues. The girl in the bag turns out to be a Navy Seal (haha) and knows self defense moves "not taught in a dojo" (actually hand to hand combat is less emphasized in the military because it simply isn't needed and rarely taught beyond the basics). The FBI agent takes a bomb with seconds to spare, takes off some of the plastique, throws it and he is OK of course. Despite having no wall or anything to block the significant explosion.

After 15 minutes I was struggling to finish this movie and admittedly took several breaks to finish it (I was very determined to find out more of the mystery), but now I don't care what the mystery is. I know it will never be very good or interesting. I am done with this show.

The 8 on the IMDb, a day after it came out, seems ludicrous to me especially since none of the few reviews think it is anything more than garbage. I think the ratings were either paid for or falsified somehow.
