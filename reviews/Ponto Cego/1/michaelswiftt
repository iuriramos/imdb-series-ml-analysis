the idea is excellent.the cast is good .then we started to get into the realms of"i have to know" "what are you hiding etc " faces started to get strange ie very intense very resigned face very hey im brilliant face .the head of the fbi lady just breathed heavy a lot and not after good sex. she was probably just as p***Ed off as i was the episode were the cast saved the city in daylight empty mega site grave yard and people hiding behind tombstones then CIA guys pop up all wearing shades and things in their ears and have an argument

the clincher for me was the visit to redneck country. you knew the sheriff was going to stitch them up. he was on the phone before the door had closed. and to the final scene the helicopter supposedly hidden under a"cant be bothered to put the tarp over the helicopter". and the grass had been mown that was it for me don't waste you're time on this series then maybe the makers and buyers will do some excellent series .
