just the same old stuff from the NBC folks nothing really shocking and certainly not believable just another cop show first of all its just a have case look for the clues shoot the bad guys look for more clue shoot the bad guys with a little government twist. Through in some cool special force lingo and a special effect here and there.the special opps crap is a build to something not all that different than any C S I programs just one lady with tattoos that's not making any special I watch 3 episodes and I needed coffee to stay awake It need more of a sci=fi twist and the villains need to be more devise if I want to watch another cop\CSI thats what I would watch I not sure the writers really knew where they were going with the story line I like plots that captivate me and this one didn't do it the hinted around during the previews that there was sci-fi element and there was none big let down for me.
