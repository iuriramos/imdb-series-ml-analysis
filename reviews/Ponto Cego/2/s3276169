Blindspot is a rather unremarkable espionage, thriller. 

Aside from the novel pretext of a girl whose tattoos gradually unlock a complex plot there's little thats new or interesting on offer here. Indeed, the notion of a secret government with its own agenda hidden inside the framework of the mainstream government, has been done to death. 

The acting is reasonable but its constrained by the general blandness of the characterizations. The main players are virtuous types or self redeemers, who are really victims of circumstance. Not a personal flaw or character blemish in sight. 

All in all, this is a bore fest, that merges like a mind numbing haze of static into the general white noise that dominates contemporary television. Two out of ten from me.
