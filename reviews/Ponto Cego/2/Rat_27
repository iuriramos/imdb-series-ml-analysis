The idea of a female Navy SEAL is ridiculous, insulting and preposterous. It is a slap in the face to all of the men who rang the bell at Coronado for whatever reason.

I only saw a few episodes, but in one, they decoded a message on her body JUST in time to stop an attack that same day. There should be no rhyme or reason to which tattoos are deciphered, and in what order. I find this to be bad writing. It might have gotten better as the series progressed, but I bailed out fairly early on.

Furthermore, this chick is a "black-ops" SEAL (does that mean DEVGRU?), yet she has a tattoo on her shoulder? So ... so secret that she isn't even listed anywhere? But, advertises it anytime she wears a wife-beater or a swimsuit? Hmm. Nope. Sorry, back to ridiculously unbelievable.

I like Stapleton. I miss Strike Back already. Please cancel this garbage, cancel The Player, and have Netflix pick up another 5 seasons on Strike Back. THAT would be a great Christmas gift!

I also got the vibe of them trying to drag out a mystery from episode to episode. In one, they get her DNA results back. But then, (oh no!) they find out that some isotope indicates that she was born in Africa. It reminded me of the terrible parts of Lost.

Anyway, the only reason it's not getting a 1, is because I liked Strike Back. But this show did absolutely nothing for me, and I really don't care how or when it ends.

Out.
