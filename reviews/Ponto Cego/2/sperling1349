Seems like every episode they tell "Jane" to stay behind (smart because she is a civilian even though she can take care of herself)but she thinks she is better than staying behind so she ignores them and then screws up the capture of some bad guy. 3 episodes in, and too many times she has gone off and ignored what she was told to do. And someone got away. Big surprise. I want to like this show because Jaime Alexander is hot, and I love the tattoos. Welcome to a mix of a great show (Prison Break) and a boring, regurgitated FBI drama that isn't even close to how things are. Agent Kurt Weller (from Australia but doing a poor job of speaking with an American accent) always sounds like he's trying to keep his gum in his mouth while he's talking. So many little things wrong and annoying with this show. This sow is another reason why if it isn't on CBS, I don't watch it. I tried, but I can't stomach it.
