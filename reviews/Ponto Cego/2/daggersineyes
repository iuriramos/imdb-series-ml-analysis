Wow! Way to ruin a perfectly good story. This is very sad and shameful. The concept is good because it's stolen from one of the most interesting movies ever made and one of the most criminally under-rated and under-appreciated - Memento starring Guy Pearce. Go watch the move - its a brilliantly crafted work of art.

Skip the TV show - it's "paint by numbers", seen it all before formulaic rubbish...

Looks like I have to add more lines to get this review in so here I am adding lines. While I'm here let me also express my horror at news I just read that some idiots are planning to "remake" the movie Memento - there is absolutely no reason to do that. It's not like the original is Japanese or Swedish or even very old - everyone can watch the first one, why would they need a remake?
