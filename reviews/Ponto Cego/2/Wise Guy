I had high hopes but only got disappointments, dunno who writes the script, dunno who approves it, but in every episode Jane is left in the car, they argue about it, she lose, stays in the car, and she gets in contact with one person of interest of that episode, and (yes not or) is left behind and she gets in contact with one person of interest of that episode, every god damn time, repetitive, not to mention the idiotic moments in every episode and the music, omg, is like every time is Armageddon, she looks at him, intense music ... Originality died in this one, I couldn't get myself past the 3rd episode. I find it as an insult to everyone's intelligence. Ridiculous drama, ridiculous acting. 2 out of 10.
