I have been watching season one and have been enjoying the story, but I must say the camera work sucks.

Who is the idiot that thinks shaky camera, way too many close ups and bad framing is going to draw a viewer into their story?

I am honestly not sure if I can watch any more episodes, most of the time I just close my eyes so I don't get dizzy and disoriented by the bad camera work and listen to the story-line/audio.

I can acknowledge this type of directing and camera work is popular, but that does not make it good or an effective way to tell a story.

To anyone thinking of using this style of storytelling with new media I would highly suggest you rethink your plan/project.
