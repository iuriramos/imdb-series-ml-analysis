Not quite totally awful, but not far from it. Yet another example of American bipolar screen writing for love sick teens! What is with this unconvincing lead Actor - a total Lothario too by all accounts and this has to be romantic entanglement with the lead actress... whose part is worse than extremely badly written. The Kurt/Allie thing worked, the Jane Oscar thing worked... The Jane /Kurt thing is the suicide bullet!

We're also deep into Season 2 now and where all the emphasis was on family... Jane now rejects her own for the very people she set out to infiltrate and bring down... This joke of a KurtLove thing again destroys any credibility the plot might otherwise have had,,,

As this season is already written I cannot expect it will get turned around-- I'll give it 3 more episodes and then it's Sayonara!

Hard to pick what's worst between Shadow Hunters, Quantico and this lame vehicle, Don't see it getting a third season (But then again Americans are voting for Clinton and Trump!!!). Just too bad it's not written by Jonathan Nolan or Directed by JJ Abrams....
