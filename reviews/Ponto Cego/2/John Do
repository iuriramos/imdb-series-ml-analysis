The series show a promising good story that kept my interest, then somehow recently I become bored of the samething over and over solving a tattoo again. The story is too soon to be revealed for Jane Doe's identity.

Agent Weller is very un-realistic as an FBI agent doing whatever he wants to do like there is no discipline or respect for authority. He would even challenging the perp with a self detonate explosive not caring for his teammates. Should replace this character.

The team always survived even to the biggest explosion that would kill in reality. I'm sure NBC can do better than this.
