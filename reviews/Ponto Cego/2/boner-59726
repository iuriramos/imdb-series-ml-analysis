While there does seem to be some interesting meta-plot in the background, it was not enticing enough to get me to put up with the deeply annoying camera-work.

There was way too much shaking around, and relentless, abusive application of close-ups. The overuse of these techniques makes the whole thing feel forced and over-wrought. Really, it is not necessary to zoom in on characters who are just standing around while routine events transpire. I don't need to see his scrabbly beard or her face-spot in such intimate detail.

Ditch the gimmicks and I might have liked it.
