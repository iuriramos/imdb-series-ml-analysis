It looked like a good premise for a series... a tattoo'd woman with clues to various conspiracies and memory loss. But then it looks like she has history with the lead FBI Agent who is then emotionally compromised but is allowed to stay on the case... then her memory starts to recover flashbacks and she is shown to have fighting and computer skills so they make her part of the team? What nonsense? Then it appears a conspiracy exists between the head of the FBI office and the head of the CIA resulting in armed conflict between the teams but nobody in the FBI team questions this or related actions? As the story progresses these ridiculous and clumsy plot artefacts just appear from nowhere and just don't fall within the threshold of suspension of disbelief. The acting is great considering the bilge the actors are expected to deliver in terms of dialog and plot logic. I watched the first five episodes and then gave up in frustration. The lazy writing and illogical holes in the plot just make it too silly to bother with.
