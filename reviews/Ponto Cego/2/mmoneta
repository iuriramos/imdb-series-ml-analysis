It quickly became clear that this was one of those shows that were centered around a mystery that was never going to be solved before cancellation.

Also, the overuse of shaky cam was starting to cause nausea; if you're similarly sensitive to excessive visual motion, you should probably give this a pass.

The plot is hard to accept, even for a TV show. Unknown person, linked to criminal activity. So the FBI makes them a member of the team and gives them a gun. Durr.

While the initial cluelessness of the lead unknown character was OK for an episode or two, the continued deer in the headlights performance was less than satisfying.
