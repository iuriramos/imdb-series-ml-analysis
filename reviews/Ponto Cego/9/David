The show is a really nice, I'm reviewing because of all the bad reviews I've seen here people complaining they got the language wrong..it means they don't speak it the writers are adding a bit of diversity, it's also worth noting that being multilingual gives you an added advantage in the world, also people saying the actors are not convincing enough, how many of you have tried acting? Give it a shot let's see how that pans out for you, It's also because they're actors not real FBI agents, if you want more reality.. Take a look at your life and the people in it or your job and the people you work with. All I'm saying is don't criticize the writers or the actors . For the writers this is what a picture of their ideal world would be like even though the world is not ideal.
