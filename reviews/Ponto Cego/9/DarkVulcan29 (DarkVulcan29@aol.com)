A mysterious woman(Jamie Alexander) is found in a bag in Time Squares, she does not know who she is, she is named Jane Doe. But she also has a bunch of tattoo's all over her body, each one is like a puzzle waiting to get solved. The FBI tries to investigate who she might be, and not only that she has a name of one FBI agent named Kurt Weller tattooed on her back. The team of FBI agents begin to feel she is not what she seems.

I really liked the first episode, it has a mix of The Bourne Identity and Memento. Jamie Alexander really plays her role well, has the confused Jane Doe, who discovers that she has a deadly set of skills, but is unsure where it came from. And she and Sullivan Stapleton who plays FBI agent Kurt Weller do have chemistry. Action and fight scenes are well done. But I hope the mystery part of who she is won't be giving away to early. I mean that is what will keep the show interesting, hoping that writers on the show will have some cleverness to it. If it revealed to early it will kill the show, like it did for Kyle XY(2006-2009), in which Alexander was in and played a similar character. Once the mystery in that show was revealed, the show I felt had nowhere else to go, and that is why it was canceled, or that is how I saw it. So please don't make the same mistakes that Kyle XY made.
