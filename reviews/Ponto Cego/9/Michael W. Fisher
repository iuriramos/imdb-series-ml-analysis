After Lost everyone was trying to recreate that original show with the mysterious plot. There were a lot of near misses and many not so near. But this show seems to be pulling it off. The story is original, the action and drama are intelligent, the acting doesn't go overboard and each actor fits well into his or her character. The pilot started out with the perfect amount of suspense and action and the show has kept the vibe going so far. I just hope they do not paint themselves into a corner, creating a mystery so outrageous it cannot be solved or when solved looks silly and contrite.I've seen this happen with other shows that tried to fill the void left by Lost.
