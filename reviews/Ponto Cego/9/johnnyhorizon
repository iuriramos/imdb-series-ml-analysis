So far this series has been excellent as far as a story line and action goes. But I'm afraid of it's only downfall is starring "Lou Diamond Phillips" as the so called bad guy part he is playing in episode 7. Which is fine episode. It's just that every TV series that LDP has acted in throughout his career has only lasted no more or less than 2 seasons at best. With the exception of one TV series..(Numb3rs)...which he was only in 9 episodes and managed to not jinx it or whatever the case maybe.

Listen... I have no problem with LDP as an actor, but there is a black cloud or something around this guy that kills good shows and even the movies he starred in. If you doubt me, go see for yourself and make your own conclusion. But I say the show won't last and leave us hanging and we all will blame the network.
