I enjoyed the pilot very much. Jamie Alexander and Sullivan Stapleton were excellent in capturing the intrigue of the main character. The emotions that were exhibited by the characters were heart felt. I truly wanted to find out who Jane Doe is and why was she in the bag. Now with some of the information being leaked through her visions and upcoming episodes we see the plot thickens. I want to know more and I cannot wait to see it next week. It has me hooked like Blacklist. Also with actors such as Ukweli Roach and Marianne Jean-Baptiste this show cannot go wrong and seems to be an added bonus. I hope they are featured more. As far as inconsistencies with language in the story please give me a break. When does Hollywood ever get everything right. It was a good start and I look forward to it getting better as time goes on. I wish them all the best.
