I have to say this is one of the best shows I have watched in a long time I am a cop show junkie I have seen all the great ones blacklist svu Chicago and more but the concept of blind spot is brilliant who ever created the show two thumbs up to you if anyone is reading this please give the show a chance you will love it too. Writers keep it up love the treasure hunt Aspect. I would love to know how Jane is tattooed is it every week it's done, or is it sprayed on or is it henna. I can't imagine how long she had to sit for the first episode when they Where all shown on the streets of time square keep up the suspense that's what makes the show.
