As a huge fan of Strike Back, was keen to see both The Player and also this show,as I wanted to see how the two leading men had got on moving on,and wow,this show is awesome,in fact it is my favorite right now! It is so full of intrigue and has me desperate not to miss anything in each episode as there seems to be so many layers to this story,and that's what I love,a great cast with a mysterious storyline that just keeps me coming back for more and more. One of the few shows I do watch that I look forward to each week. Jaimie Alexander is simply outstanding in this role, and Sullivan Stapleton's her perfect counter part. This show is very addictive,with brilliant writing, exciting drama...just love it!
