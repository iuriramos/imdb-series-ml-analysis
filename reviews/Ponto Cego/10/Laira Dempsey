Blindspot is the best show in existence, I really like the chemistry between all the characters and how they see each other as family... Jane Doe is the most complicated puzzle I've ever seen, there's always something new about her, the struggles she faces throughout this first season are intense, and she takes it all in like a trooper, really love the Jeller and Pattata ships. 

Who is Jane Doe? Taylor Shaw, the missing girl? Or maybe not. Will the past cloud our eyes? Trust no one. Suspect everyone. Lift the curtain and unveil the mastermind. In case of emergency follow these instructions: Stay where you are. Find a secure line to Contact Your Handler. Find what you need in almost the last place you look. To begin the sequence, focus on the time, then wait for the address to your new safe house. The final Order will be revealed when it's filed away.
