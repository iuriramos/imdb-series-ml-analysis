Quite the entertaining show indeed. I enjoy the plot lines, however at times quite predictable. The story is compelling and makes the viewer want to come back week after week. The action is exciting and driving. Like most drama's but worth a watch. However it is like most cop shows "Crime committed, cops hear about crime, try to collect the evidence, Figure out who,what,when,where. Solve crime, catch or shoot crook." I like where Jane's tattoo's are a link to the crimes, and makes me wonder will they ever get to the bottom of huge list of tats on her body. Will she ever regain her total recall. Must watch to find out. Excitement week after week and another problem solved.
