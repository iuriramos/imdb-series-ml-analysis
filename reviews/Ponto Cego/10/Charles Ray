Jane Doe, the main female character in 'Blindspot,' doesn't know who she is, but she has abilities not possessed by the average person - male or female. She is vulnerable only in that she has no memory, and she doesn't know who put tattoos over her whole body, addressed to the FBI. But, there her vulnerability ends. When threatened, Jane kicks butt as well as any man, better than most. It doesn't hurt that she's drop-dead gorgeous; we're talking TV after all. This is, in my humble opinion, THE best offering of this TV season. Complete with a brooding FBI agent who has some serious issues, who happens to work for a tough woman senior agent, 'Blindspot' is set to defy all of the cinematic stereotypes about female characters, and it's about time.
