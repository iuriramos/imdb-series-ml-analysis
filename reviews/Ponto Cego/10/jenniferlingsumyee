this really is an excellent television show. its not only a good procedural drama, its a great one. this show demonstrates how the tattoos on a woman with amnesia is helpful with cases of corruption, killings and much more. people think this show is simply way too fast or the dialogue doesn't make sense. well they are intelligent detectives that are also off the charts with combat! it made sense to me how quickly they assessed these situations and figured out how to stop the suspects. great cast and diversity, not people that we see over and over again, and characters with twists and changes that make the TV show fun and crazily interesting.

I've watched so many TV shows that have a mysterious plot and I've never been more intrigued. its not a lovey dovey show with romance, and its actually a kick ass show with an epic episode every week.
