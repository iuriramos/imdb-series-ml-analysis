It absolutely blows my mind seeing all the bad reviews for this show. Don't even begin to listen to them... instead, pay attention to the fact that despite all these "Debbie downers", it is currently rated a 7.9 and climbing. I assure you, this is the very best show on US network television right now. One reviewer even had the gall to call Jaimie Alexander a terrible actress. Are you kidding me? She is absolutely stellar. And to the people calling it nothing but a clone of other cop shows- It's a cop show, for crying out loud. Of course there are going to be similarities to other cop shows... it comes with the territory. However, this show has a unique premise that is unlike all the other ones. The action comes at you by the bucket full, and is riveting to watch. Most cop shows have a much more deliberate pace. And the action is very well filmed. 

This kind of reminds me of all the scathing reviews that "The 100" got- and boy were they ever wrong! Even though I absolutely love this show, "The 100" sets the standard for all network shows, and if they don't realize that, it is seriously their loss. But that show has not yet returned for it's next season, so this is as good as you are going to get right now. 

I will admit, Sullivan Stapleton is not very strong in his role as Agent Weller. He is rather one dimensional, but that barely detracts from the overall quality of this effort. And come on people, that's Lady Sif, for crying out loud- with tattoos! Talk about some serious eye candy to go along with her acting chops.

So in conclusion, IGNORE the naysayers, and pay attention to that high rating instead. Unless your brain is as strangely wired as theirs are, you will not be disappointed. Trust me.
