When i start watch the show, i don't know what to expect, but with every episode the story develop and characters too. The end of first season will be exciting and i'm sure it will prepare the viewers to season two. I like how the crew behind series trying to develop every main character and we about for every of them little by every next episode. Dynamic of episodes is good. Have everything: action, thriller, mystery and some puzzle to resolve. Yes, sometimes i notice a mistakes, but often they aren't in story line, and in successive scenes, but not so significant for story . Generally i like the show and i hope "Blindspot" has a bright future.
