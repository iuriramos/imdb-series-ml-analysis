Definitely contains spoilers: Please stop here to prevent being spoiled if you have not watch this amazing show! 

Only wanted to note just how much it felt like Fight Club. More noticeably, it feels as if the entire premise for the show was lifted/heavily inspired from Fight Club directly. Sadly, as soon as this realization was made in the second/third episode the plot of the first season became extremely predictable and lost its novelty. 

Still an amazing show, just unfortunate that they not only had the same twist, but terrorist cell plot as well with similar characters and development.
