/refers to Series 1/

I am usually cautious in watching software- and/or freak-out-related movies as they tend to deal with difficult matters not bespeaking me. But Mr. Robot, recommended to me by some like-minded friends, turned out a different one, when the topics mentioned are just a background and "excuse" for wider concepts and global issues really happened/happening, and one can ponder on and over multiple follow-ups of globalization and Internet, e.g. technical vulnerability, social differentiation and stratification, personal loneliness and emptiness, use of various mood-improving substances, etc. And all this in a "digestible" package, with interesting turns, distinct approaches, skillful choice of character actors, and intertwining multilayer events and characters. All actors except Christian Slater were rather unknown to me, but there is a good chemistry between them, no one dominates too much, and a Swede called Martin Wallstr√∂m made his first and successful international appearance. And, of course, Rami Malek is "just it!" for this role, and hopefully he will get more leading roles in the future.

The very ending of the Series is intriguing, and despite the fact that some last episodes saw some decline in pace and clarity (for me as non- follower of Occupy Wall Street! type of events), I am looking forward to the next season.
