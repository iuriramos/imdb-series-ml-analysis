The show started out with great promise for me and I truly enjoyed the first half. There was a lot of energy and mystery with great build up that I hoped would lead into an even better and explosive second half. What I got was unfortunately much less than what I expected. I guessed all of the plot twists simply because I watched Fight Club one too many times. The V for Vendetta vibes were also very strong and I got a bored during pivotal moments because it felt like re-watching the movie. An homage or a play on this type of genre would have been amazing, but the similarities became so literal that I left the first season with a sense of deja vu and disappointment.

I'm being generous with my rating because I do believe there was great potential in the plot that could be saved in the next season. The performances and cinematography are amazing and much better than I would have expected of a USA show (I love a lot of USA shows, but let's be real here). The writing had its strong points which I definitely wouldn't want to overlook. There were strong monologues, great line delivery that actually packed a punch instead of making me feel like I was watching a soap opera, and interesting subplots that didn't make me want to fast forward. Despite all the predictable outcomes, I definitely felt the tension building to something by the season finale, but I am wary as to how it will all play out.

I'll most likely watch the second season because it's good television that just needs to work out some kinks (specifically, ditching the bootleg Fight Club scenes and peppering in some originality where the main plot is concerned). I'm putting a lot of faith into this show, but I hope it gets rewarded.
