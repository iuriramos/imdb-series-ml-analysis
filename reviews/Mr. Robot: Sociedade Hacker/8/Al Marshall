Having watched 2 and a fraction episodes, I'm starting to like this "against my will".

"Against my will" because the gray-hat hacker Elliot reminds me of every arrogant/annoying kid I worked with in my software engineering career. Plus, it took me a while to appreciate that Elliot was going to be rendered with a lot of nuances instead of a simple "glorious fighter against evil".

There are a lot of things that bring back the security stuff that I learned toward the end of my career when I was reading people like Bruce Schneier. I particularly "appreciate" things that ring true such as his snark against older people (and for example their choice of weak passwords).. they sting, but for many people they're accurate.

Finally, I can't think of any performance that Gloria Reuben has done that I disliked; this piece is no exception.
