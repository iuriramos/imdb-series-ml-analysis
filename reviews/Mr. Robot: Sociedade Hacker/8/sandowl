I wanted to write a 2 sentence review; 'Bravo! More please...' However IMDb doesn't allow for that and neither does it let me place the spacing as I would like, between my lines of commentary and review, which is rather frustrating IMDb.

This looks really promising. It's intelligent (thank the Gods. Yes!), absorbing, interesting and different to the usual garbage trotted out by the truck load to invade our space every minute of the day. (How many times can you watch a person cook food, or 'be themselves' on a 'reality' show, or renovate a dwelling/building? It's inane and mind-numbing stuff).

The main character, Elliot, reminds me of a couple of Aspie friends I have. I'm not sure if the writers were going for that in any way, yet it's the closest portrayal of a person with such idiosyncrasies I have seen on television. The young man playing Elliot is fantastic in the role. Very subtle and natural which lends to believability in the character.

There's a television in my lounge-room which spends its time gathering dust. This is one reason to use it.
