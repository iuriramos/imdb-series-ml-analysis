I'm a little late to the party and just watched Season 1 but wow this is a great show. Thought provoking, entertaining and everything else I want from my television. The appeal of the show is in large part due to the actor portraying Elliot. He is not your stereotypical chisel jawed hero. There is pain in his eyes and a darkness in his soul. You find yourself drawn into his struggle against the evils of corporations as well as his own demons.

Rami Malek is an unusual star who deserves all the accolades he has received. And while Christian Slater is mostly over the top in his performance, his dynamic with Elliot is fascinating and keeps you gripped episode to episode.
