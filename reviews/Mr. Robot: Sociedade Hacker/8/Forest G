I love the pilot episode, it's really good 60 minutes. I wonder if the next episode also will play in 60 minutes per episode.

The first scene already give the idea to the audience that this could be awesome series, it feels so original too.

The cinematography is candy in the eyes. Well, that's plus.

The story is original and quite unique. The writing is good, like they know how real hacker works, not only they hack in computer, but there is also AFK, and stalking works for the hacker to do. many movies make hacker looks super awesome that they can hack anything only by sitting their ass in front of laptop, it is just so unrealistic, not with this show.

I like the main character. I kinda hate the scene where he cried because he is lonely thou. But It's alright. Overall this is amazing new show with original ideas, good writing, acting, and beautiful cinematography. Totally gonna follow this serial TV.
