It's not often a series opens with such strong performance, it brazenly captivates the audience with not only smart premise but also an identifiable observation of society. Rami Malek confidently steps into the leading role with all the awkwardness and anxiety of a vigilante hacker. Mr. Robot takes a different route of technology-based crime drama, it treats the subject with enough credible realism and without being detached from audience like over-the-top hacker with sunglasses gimmick.

Rami Malek as Elliot delivers a hefty amount of monologues, he literally communicates with the audience as though he's talking to an imaginary friend. This approach could end up stale, yet the brilliantly fresh material and admirable performance make for a highly intriguing watch. Elliot is tech savvy, though sociably clumsy. It's a different take on leading character, which is why it's compelling to see him dissect all the trivial matters with unapologetic precision.

He solves problem by stepping on a gray area between privacy breach and vigilante assistance. At some point he encounters an attack to a large company's server. There he finds a ploy to sabotage very important parties and the subsequent far-reaching effects. Due to his indifference nature and chosen action, Elliot begins his involvement in the web of conspiracy.

The production is nice without being overly futuristic. Clips of social media and the view of large metropolis are handled with poise, transitioning from a cool shot of the urban scenery to cynical presentation of pop culture. It doesn't attempt to glamorize hacking like typical blockbuster mishaps, the kind where the hacker shouts at the screen with countdown timer. The show knows its theme and it presents it with both accessibility and sophistication.

With an outstandingly interesting pilot, it's a pleasure connecting with Mr. Robot.
