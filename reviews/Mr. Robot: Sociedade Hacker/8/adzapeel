OK. I give the show 8/10 because the camera angles are so off-kilter that even boring scenes are watchable. Loved the pilot episode. I wish the series continued along that path of self contained episodes instead of the overdone stretched storyline. Some episodes went in a different direction without a good reason. What was the deal with the drug dealing gangsters and why kill the chick? Tyrell makes some of the most ridiculous "plays"at getting the promotion. If that is a way to represent his instability the it is way overdone. Actually all the characters are very much unstable and socially retarded. Yet, for all the dumb plot twists and inexplicable behaviours of the main characters, I am drawn to the show. The reason, Rami Malek. His portrayal of Elliot shows that you don't need to act larger than life to be noticed. He doesn't have the looks of a Hollywood star. He plays a weirdo, anti-hero who ha no real redeeming character traits, yet if not for him, the show would have lost me a long time ago. Christian Slater is the exact opposite. Luckily, he goes missing for large portions of the show. There is another, DB Wong as Whiterose. Just outstanding and I hope series 2 will have a lot more of him. There it is, a show that should not work, possibly becomes a classic. All in spite of the writers and producers seemingly trying to kill it as fast as possible. Awesome.
