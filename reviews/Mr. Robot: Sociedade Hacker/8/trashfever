Mr. Robot uses building blocks from everything from Fight Club to Twin Peaks. As you watch you can see every influence. The title card feels like Kubrick designed it and you feel hints of his style in a lot of shots. The one thing that is new and different is how the show portrays technology. TV and film fail every time to show a realistic portrait of computers and hacking. Mr. Robot has no flashy fake graphics and a ton of jargon that sounds good but means nothing. From the first scene we are fully locked into reality as Elliot casually explains to a coffee shop owner that his .onion TOR pedophilia site has been found and the police are on their way. The familiar bits and the new realistic representation of technology blend to form a show that isn't like anything you've seen. Mr. Robot never holds your hand and it keeps you on your feet. Each new turn feels calculated, a place for everything. Sam Esmail, show creator, says that the show is already built and that it is headed somewhere, and you can feel it as you watch each episode. The mysteries are slow to unravel, but this hopefully isn't another Lost, which felt like a cobbled together make it as you go monster. 

Hopefully Mr. Robot proves itself to be a precise, well-made watch such as shows like The Wire and Breaking Bad.
