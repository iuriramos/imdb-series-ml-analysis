Mr. Robot a true series for the age of information. I think it helps to be 30 or younger to get all the subtle nuances going on here. This old man will try to do the best he can.

Our protagonist is Rami Malek a perfect product of the age of information. He's a computer programmer working for a company that's supposed to protect from cyber attack their clients, the biggest of which is a company led by Bruce Altman. Said company is under attack at the moment and the leader of the attackers is cyber anarchist Christian Slater in the title role of Mr. Robot.

Malek is a flawed hero like Adrian Monk and he functions best working and living alone. He's got social anxiety and the creators of Mr. Robot have used a technique first developed by Eugene O'Neill for Strange Interlude. Through Malek's own voice over narration we get the real action because the real action is going on in his own mind.

Malek is socially dysfunctional, but his skills like Monk are not to be denied. It's why Slater is recruiting him for his cadre of hackers looking to free the world of debt. Free it of debt and humankind is truly free.

What I find curious is that if this show had debuted 20 years ago Slater would probably the one recruited instead of doing the recruiting. Malek's Elliott Alderson is just the kind of role that Slater would have done in his salad days.

Mr. Robot is well written and acted and deals with some interesting concepts about our age of information.
