There is a tendency to over-score American drama series, especially when compared to superlative European drama and indeed comedy. The opening episode of Mr Robot hints at greatness. A thoughtful concept capturing some of the 'David vs high tech big data corporate Goliath'zeitgeist. The script is rich and the production doesn't betray the concept. However, as the season progresses, Mr Robot gets more complex and there start to be more questions posed than answers given. This doesn't mean Mr Robot can't go on to be a great drama, but rather that season 1 has set the scene and that season 2 needs to build and credibily resolve the outstanding questions. There are some great acting performances. Cristian Slater has been brilliant since True Romance. The Swedish wife is chilling, both in terms of beauty and personality. I hope Mr Robot reaches its potential. But season 1 has promise and I've scored it based on this.
