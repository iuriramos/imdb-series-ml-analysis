This show is incredible. the cinematography alone is amazing. Its like the shining meets Fargo. the camera angles and symmetry draw you in and show you real life intensities to the point where you forget you're watching a screen.

the main character tells us whats going on through his brain but more importantly what he allows the world to see him as. we get to get an inside look at the life of a social anxiety ridden junkie who finds power in knowing someones entire life without them knowing him.

usually when i watch hacking movies or shows, i get confused by the terms but since we get to hear Elliot's thoughts as we go its easier to understand.

very powerful show. cant wait to see more.
