Nowdays it's not easy to find a real original and interesting series. This one is definitely The One! Finally an interesting mix of psychological problems, society disorders, conspiracy and a huge amount of good acting... A blast!! 

Downsides: Maybe the last chapters of the 1st season are not really interesting as the previous ones, but the plot stays interesting anyway. I can't wait to see the next season.

If you like crazy stories about hacking... conspiracies and strange theories about the world. Welcome to Mr. Robot! You won't regret the time you will spend watching this masterpiece!
