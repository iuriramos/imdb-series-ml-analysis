First, episode one was very entertaining. Most techies will be able to identify with the main character. We are all disappointed and angry that we live in the future and it somehow it sucks more every year. The 'E' corp suits are shaping up to be entertaining villains. Mr. Robot is mysterious and lives in a cool retro arcade which draws you in.

Mr Robot claims wiping the credit cards clean will free the masses from being slaves to the banks? NOT. The banks will get bailed out or we all get to take the time machine back to the stone age. The masses will rack credit up again, WAY faster and more reckless than before. Why? Because they will simply assume that the bank fairy will come along again. Ever lend money to a relative? Ever get paid back? Ever??? Relatives expect debt forgiveness. They don't pay you back because they forget how desperate they were and their jealously blinds them into believing they deserve your money. They work harder, or are smarter, or you are mean or whatever. Sound familiar? The human race are your brothers and sisters.

Got debt? Just pay your cards down. From experience, life sucks for 1 year but after that it gets way better really fast. Those who did Dave Ramsey's debt snowball know how empowering it feels. Or negotiate your debts and pay 10 or 20 cents on the dollar. Don't worry about the banks, they expect some write-downs just like you expect your relatives to shaft you lending money. Unlike you the banks factor that into their interest rates. Or declare bankruptcy. That's capitalism's debt fairy. You won't be able to finance a car for 7 years - but that's actually a good thing. So far the show paints us as trapped cattle and never considers that we have the will to avoid our own slaughter.

I hope this show visits the real issues. Like the foolish class war. Or the real reasons behind our stagnant living standards. Or that for the first time the fruit of this technological revolution is yielding for our children a world worse off.
