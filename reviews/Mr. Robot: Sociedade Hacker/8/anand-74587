This serial is for computer guys. Most of the characters on the show are hackers. Its all about hacking..like..hacker's personal life...his professional life..his friends..his girlfriend..his crush..his enemy..his mission etc. So, if you think hackers are cool watch this show, you would not be disappointed. The main character is a weirdo named Elliot, he is kind of interesting and is heart of the show.Like Harvey Specter in Suits. Guy playing his role has justified his work. All the supporting cast is just average. Then comes story line, it is above average. The main problem is that the conversations include too many technical terms that makes it hard to bear sometimes. It could have been simplified a little. Direction is very good. The music is not in the league as house of cards but it not disappointing either. Mr. Robot feels a bit slow at times, I think that is demand of the main character. All in all the show is very nice but for a limited audience. This show demands handful of patience and interest in computer stuff. others would not watch more than 20 minutes. So, watch it only if it is your cup of tea.
