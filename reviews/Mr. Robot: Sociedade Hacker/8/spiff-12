Some people will hate this show. It requires some effort and it requires that you pay attention while watching it. Often, and to be honest; the part that bugs me, there will be something that happened 3 or 4 episodes previous. You will have to remember it to really get the most out of the story. Much like an independent or European film, sometimes very subtle things can say so much. Unfortunately, when you put something subtle 4 episodes previous (or even in a previous season), things get a little tricky. 

Apart from that? I love it! The situational drama can be intense! The story is enigmatic and amazing. It's not everybody's cup-of-tea I get that. For someone who likes to play the drums while they watch TV...or maybe someone who just doesn't like to think...or maybe someone who knows enough about computers to be offended by the misappropriation of Syntax (and/or logical properties) then this wouldn't be the show for them.
