Mr Robot is was a surprising and refreshing find, - I stumbled on it by accident. The acting is quite good especially Elliot and the psycho effects well done, I'm hoping it doesn't go the way of most American made series these days, that is over stretching the plot so it becomes tedious and then looping over themes endlessly, of late it seems American script writers have forgotten that a good story needs a start a middle and an end. and that the end is as important a part as the any other. thus far it seems OK although its a tad predictable. with 2 episodes to go, lets hope the writers are courageous enough to let this one have a worthy ending.
