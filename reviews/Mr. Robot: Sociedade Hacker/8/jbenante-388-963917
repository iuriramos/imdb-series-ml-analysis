I have seen the first three episodes of this series, and if feels like ten. That's not necessarily a good thing - but in the case of Mr. Robot - it is!

The pilot episode had almost too much crammed into it. I watched it in parts over a few days, and was amazed to realize that it clocked in at only about an hour. Had I not bothered to find that out, I likely would have guessed at least twice that.

The character of Elliot is superb, and played very well by Rami Malik. His is a dark soul that hides a basic goodness that the viewer can almost touch. I think many people can identify with that darkness. His narration, spoken in a kind of deadpan, broken manner, sometimes verge on the poetic.

Of course, in our reality there is no corporation called Evil Corp. And though not every corporation IS evil, clearly there are at least a few that are. It's never by design - things just turn out that way.

Besides Elliot, there are other interesting, reasonably realistic character populating the series. As in the real world, almost all are damaged in some way.

I can only hope that the quality of the series extends beyond the episodes I have seen so far. It's not an easy thing to accomplish, and very few such series have done it.
