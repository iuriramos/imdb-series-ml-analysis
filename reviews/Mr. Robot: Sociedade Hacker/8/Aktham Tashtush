The pilot started in a really intriguing vague way .. it went so mysterious ,, i didn't even see the trailer .. The story began simply about this socially awkward hacker being paranoid about someone following him ... some flashbacks then the other main characters starts to appear one by one.

The plot is not that fresh but the execution "through my 10 years of TV shows obsession" was genius ,, so much like the movies where there's a delusional guys or you think is he really !! the beginning of it kinda reminded me of "fight club" monologue style .. through this secretive scenario it kinda made me want to watch more ... want to know more ... is this guy really a hacker or is he a new Age Stalker !!! .. but the rhythm went down exactly when Elliot meets with Mr.Robot in the train before it get back to be more exciting and full of questions.

And i loved the idea of him easily hacking everybody and analyzing them based on their passwords and Facebook pages is he a bad guy!! or is he a guy trying to save everyone from Evil Corps :D .. Gosh so many questions have been thrown at us in the first episode .. and they left us with a massive confusion in the last scene :P

The Drama looks really good .,, not much on the crime part.. maybe it got on the Cyper crimes thingy more!! the other thing that set me off a bit is there are so much technical talk ... which even for me as an Engineer sounded nerdy and not easy to understand but still kept so damn hooked.

As for the Cast is fine , Rami Malek the Pharaoh from the museum ;) and his face was priceless acting delusional, i love Christian Slater and all the others were fine.

Overall,, the pilot went just okay .. Fast events .. few things needed a bit more info .. i don't know!! maybe the Tech guys would love this kinda shows even more.. it might be too early to judge but i really hope this gets even better and more clear so it would be up there with other USA Network hits like "white collar", "Suits " or "Psych" and not to be just another summer show waiting to get cancelled.
