I have just seen the pilot episode of the series and my review is based on it. The show features a socially reserved guy who is hacker by passion and an IT Network security guy by profession. He has an urge to bring some change in the world but feels his lone efforts are not enough. Then comes the twist where he meets a stranger who offers him a chance to join him in their underground mission to bring equality in the world. I am quite intrigued by the pilot episode and very interested to see what the show has in offering. It is not that age old boring hacking stuff which we normally watch in commercial movies. Acting wise it seems good and lead Rami Malek has done fantastic job. It is promising start but will wait for series to unfold till then I would give it 8/10.
