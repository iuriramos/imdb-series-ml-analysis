First off - for all the people that are ranting its $%Â£* because its technically inaccurate or has sweeping generalisations - they just don't get it. the show is about a dysfunctional but gifted security programmer/coder by day and disenfranchised hacktivist by night. he has difficulty maintaining relationships and can only really get close to people by hacking/invading their lives. he has a therapist and a uses drugs to cope with his reality. the tone and feel of the pilot is very striking an sets up the story very well. If you are not interested in social problems, computing, social media etc you will probably not like this, I'd say give it a try anyway. Christian Slater's appearance is a welcome one as the other protagonist/mentor/illusion? the show tries to highlight our increasingly digitalised age and the technobubble in which people have wrapped themselves in in order to escape or avoid their reality(y'know the peeps that live on FB TWtr Snpcht like they can't stand to be in their own bodies!) and at times your not sure if what you are seeing is a delusion on the part of the main character (Elliot). Again for all the people screaming about how bad it is - there has to be sweeping generalisations and some dumbing down of the tech language and explanations otherwise you'd be left with a narrative that speaks to 1% of the population in short - go and Hatewatch something else! I truly hope this show lives up to the promise of the pilot and our antihero succeeds in his quest.
