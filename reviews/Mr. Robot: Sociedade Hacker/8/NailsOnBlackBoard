Don't have a lot of details to give out other than my own enjoyment. This is definitely one series I will be looking forward to. I'm already hooked! Love the suspense and the narration, the character is quirky, a complete introvert so I can identify. This is more of what I was expecting "Black Hat" to be. Regrettably it did not come close. So far there is no addition of "love" potion into the story line. There is a hint of underlying admiration, but none of that American formula of throwing in a love interest for the sake of having one. Thank you.

The main character is, as I said quirky, but it adds to the complexity of who this person is on the inside and the outside. I identify with him because at times I too have been disappointed by society's lustful greed for power and money.

Can't wait for the next episode.
