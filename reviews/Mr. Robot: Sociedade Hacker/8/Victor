A 20 century, character driven drama. Every single character in the series is unique and deeply presented to the viewer. The show is totally unpredictable and very character driven. The acting is great and the story is rich. Without a doubt it is high quality television. The only downside is the very high climactic and story wrapping ending, which makes us wonder what season 2 will be based around. We can hope it wont be just a calm after the storm season. Definitely worth watching, gets you hooked after 1 episode, which is the trademark of a good TV show. I gave it 8 out of 9, because 10 always seems too fan boyish. Unless its Game of thrones, of course.
