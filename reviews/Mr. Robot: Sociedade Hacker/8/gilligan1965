I know very little about computers and nothing at all about hacking them, but, the concept of this series is great and in a class all buy itself...a computer vigilante who targets white-collar criminals and other bad people by using their own personal information against them!?!? Good!

Until seeing this, I thought that all hackers did were rotten things like stealing information and money, sending viruses, and, hurting innocent people for personal gain. This guy is doing mankind a service by hurting those who hurt the innocent. Once again, Good!

For a computer inept like myself, this series is also somewhat explaining how and why computer protection companies, and, law enforcement agencies, always seem to be one or more steps behind the people (hackers/criminals) they're paid to catch and shut down. Job security! If all hackers were suddenly stopped, as with all other criminals, terrorists, etc., a lot of people, such as those in the FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland Security, and, even local police departments, would no longer be needed and be put out of their jobs, as would those in the court system, alarm companies, and, everyone else all the way down to the makers of simple pad locks and dead bolts. This will never be allowed by the powers that be. That's why this guy, Elliot Alderson, would have to be looked upon by law enforcement people as a criminal. Not necessarily because he is, but, because he makes them look incompetent and dysfunctional; but, John Q. Citizen sees him as a vigilante - a hero who's doing what law enforcement cannot or will not do.

I like this series. Elliot Alderson is much like a Charles Bronson ("Death Wish") vigilante of the internet! :)
