First of all I have to say, I felt connected with Malek in many ways. His anti-social behavior, his view of the modern society, his drug habit, his relationships etc. The pilot was on a good start from the very first minute and it grew on me as it unraveled. I found myself craving for more and more each minute it passed, to the point I stopped the video to check how much more it had left (it was about at the 40min mark, with another or so minuted to go). I don't really love the fact that Malek is delusional, as it may provide an easy solution for nearly EVERYTHING that will go on as the show moves, but if played right, it can become the whole show itself, so meh, I don't know how to feel about that. His relationship with Angela was rather dull, until the point he went and defended her on the meeting, thus justifying not turning the fscociety group to the authorities as his moral code was all about (this and the nearly 200,000$ of student loans she has). Anyway I didn't wanted this to turn out analyzing every turn this episode took so I will stop here. I give it 8/10 with high hopes (and great fear as well) for the next episode! La Ku
