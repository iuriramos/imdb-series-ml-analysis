I was looking for something new, something fresh, and of course, within my taste . I like the lone-type hero main character, that doesn't go focus other characters more than necessary.

I checked the "most popular TV-show" link and checked the plots of each of them and among all of those selection, the one that stick out was Mr. Robot.

I'm a bit of a techy and idolized those that are most familiarized with them. They create and solve. And sure enough, Mr. Robot feature someone like it.

Being as society calls them geeks with buck teeth, and social problems, I was expectant of that for our main character here. His name is Eliot (hope that is spelled right). He has issues but is portrayed as powerful in his skills. But contrary to the usual geek vs geek plot, here, they show us the ability of Eliot can be used in many ways we wouldn't have guessed.

As characters are introduced or focused in his problems, each of them would be subjected. I tell you, you wouldn't want to be one of Eliot's subject 'cause every privacy you have would be out. Secrets of that person would be found out and for what I perceived, this secrets can be a dark one, little or big. And when you cross him, you would get what you deserved, this is according to his moral code and as of yet, I am still with his moral goodness. It seems alright.

If I had this abilities, I would do what he did in those circumstances, perhaps... Anyway, it kinds of resembles a superhero in our normal society just like doctors go battling for their patients lives, soldiers battling their wars, and teachers educating children, Eliot battle corporates, killers, murders in his own way.
