Mr. Robot is an very well made series. The directing is solid, and the soundscape really adds to the tension in the story. "eps1.7_wh1ter0se.m4v" is my favorite episode of the series: it's mind bending and just flat out thrilling. That episode reminds me of BBC's Sherlock: playing mind games throughout the entire episode. Mr. Robot has been doing that since episode 1, and not being sure what is real and what is not is what makes that episode awesome (9/10)

Some of the episodes, like the pilot, are a little overrated, but still very good. I was let down by the final two episodes, after the huge build up from Brave Traveler through Whiterose. 

Overall, Mr. Robot is an awesome series that I will make sure to keep on watching.

8/10
