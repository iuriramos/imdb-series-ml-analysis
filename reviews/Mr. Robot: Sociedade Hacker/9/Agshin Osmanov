When good friend of mine came to me and asked me if i watched Mr.Robot and I answered no he started talking and complimenting on this TV Series. I was intrigued and promised I will watch it right after I finish my exams. Well, the day before my exams started i saw the trailer and i couldn't take it out of my mind. So, I watched when I had exams but I have got no regrets. This TV Show is a masterpiece!

I am more into Movies and not much to TV Series but if it is "Mr.Robot", things change. This is what all "Fight Club" fans have been waiting for. and release of "Mr.Robot" is exactly what we needed while all going around the world. I thank the creators of "Mr.Robot" for making it. We are the Fsociety!
