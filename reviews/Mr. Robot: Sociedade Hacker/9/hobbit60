I am half way through the first series of the show now, and I simply don't get where those writing the one star reviews are coming from.

Yes, there are some minor inaccuracies in the technical aspects of the show, but they are nowhere near as egregious as some on here are making out. There is a correct emphasis on using social engineering to achieve goals, rather than the usual Hollywood crap of pushing the (art director generated) magic button to produce the magical outcome. This show actually attempts to show the usage of computers and the use of the cli as it actually IS, rather than as some fantasy generated by Hollywood scriptwriters.

I work in IT. I use Unix as my desktop and server OS. So, it will come as no surprise that they had me when the central character used chmod -x to change permissions on a rootkit.

Also, a lot of people on here seem to have trouble with the concept of the unreliable narrator. This is a fairly standard trope, I would have thought, and would seem to indicate a lack of sophistication in the reviewer rather than a fault in the show.

To sum up - an excellent series about IT which actually requires a certain level of intelligence and attention from its viewers.
