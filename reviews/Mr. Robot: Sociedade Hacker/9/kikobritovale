I have to get something off my chest

Great show, it is maybe in the tier of true detective (~9/10, dark, modern, good argument), but

The 'fight club' plot was too obvious, it wasn't even a twist (post episode 9) who didn't think this was going to happen since episode 1..

Just wishing for something more interesting to develop, and it didn't

(By the way, the casting of the Swedish couple... Perfect. Elliot and his dad as well of course but the Swedish couple interactions are crazy good)

Still, i obviously recommend this show and am very curious for season 2
