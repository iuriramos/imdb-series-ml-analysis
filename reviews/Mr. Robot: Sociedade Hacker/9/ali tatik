It's all about the awareness of a disturbing notion that induces a malaise on someone from which one is distracted by it's very cause. Trying to change the world for the better may help coping with it as it is implemented by our protagonist in this promising pilot. Nevertheless there won't be any curing in sight for him since bothering with trivial circumstances of the 'real world' we live in is just an induced deflection from the real Mama: our own very existence. Life is short and vulnerable and the moment you pay too much attention to this notion, you'll end up like Mr. Robot. Cheer up, it's just a movie. 

Last but not least standing ovation to the Director Niels Arden Oplev and Writer Sam Esmail, not to mention the intriguingly interpretation of the lead character by Rami Malek. I was always hoping for a real world adoption of The Matrix- so don't mess it up people!
