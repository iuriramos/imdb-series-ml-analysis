I wasn't expecting much, so the surprise of liking it so much was very exciting. I began to see a possible future without the Corporation. Corporations, legal entities without heart and soul, that turn the labors of underpaid minions into huge profits, distributed to a few already rich shareholders. 

And when the profits are not satisfying enough? Well, then they out source. Leaving Americans without work and dangling in a society that doesn't have enough jobs but has this insane idea that it is ones own fault if they are unemployed. 

Corporations should be paying the cost of supporting unemployed men and women they threw to the wolves - penalized and taxed for hurting the economy in favor of their bottom line.

Or someday we could see a revolution, a bloodless one, where the people just undo the ability of Corporations to act with impunity as they suck up natural and human resources and give nothing back. 

Well that is the promise of this very interesting and entertaining new series. I can't wait for episode 2.
