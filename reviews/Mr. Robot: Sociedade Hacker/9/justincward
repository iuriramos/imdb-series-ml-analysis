Vigilante uberhacker Elliot (Rami Malek) takes on ruthless mutinational Evil Corp - who killed his father - while suffering from mental illness and morphine addiction.

You know what Mr. Robot is? It's old-school science fiction, the kind that ends up with familiar streets full of people with placards, and anarchy going on, in order to make a point about human society in general. In this show, the alien invaders are the good guys, and they're the dark network of computer hackers.

On a human level, the Mr. Robot series asks the question, 'Why would anyone write computer viruses?' and the answer for Elliot is twofold, and it isn't 'money': one, it's to get revenge on the multinational that gave his father leukemia and two, to be a nice guy doing bad things because the rest of the world are 'pr*cks' and they deserve it, as his father taught him.

SPOILER: the character of 'Mr. Robot' played by Christian Slater is actually Elliot's dead father, in a twist from 'Fight Club' among others (Sixth Sense even), but unlike those, this isn't a major plot point. This is more the depiction of Elliot's illness from his own point of view, and it works. There is a lot of it, btw.

Why the Breaking Bad reference? There are similarities in the hero trying to be the baddest SOB in the valley, and the whole drug'n'prison dealing-with-the-devil shtick and the well-maintained suspense. There's even a 'Bonfire Of The Vanities' subplot.

Not perfect - for example the way Vera, the badass drug dealer simply skips off into nowhere is a bit weak (though he may return in series 2?); a quick glance at the 'hated it' reviews will, of course, destroy the authenticity of the hacking techniques, and the gay and bondage sex scenes are a little bit gratuitous in the way of 1980's soft pr0n videos, but if you enjoyed the subtexts of Breaking Bad and the like, Mr Robot will satisfy that hunger.
