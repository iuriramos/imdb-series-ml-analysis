After completing the Season 1, Mr. Robot certainly keeps me waiting for the following season. I'm glad the series did not extensively stress on "hacking" as the main theme (projected in the trailer and such) and went a little further to emphasize on today's society and reality.

I'm a huge fan of the cinematography in each episode and get excited every time i see the words "MR. ROBOT" appear in front of my screen. Another aspect you won't find in many series is how Elliot (Rami Malek) addresses the audience as his "imaginary friend" and talks to us indirectly as we are the ones controlling his mind. 

As much as i hate the unfulfilled plot holes that were left to be answered in Season 2, i loved what creator Sam Esmail introduced throughout the season. The soundtrack is on point; one of the best i've heard that gives me that Social Network vibe. 

This is a must watch for those interested in Tech and/or like to experience a new theme of crime and thriller.
