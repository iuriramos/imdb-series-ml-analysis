Rami Malek. I haven't seen his other work, but I recognised the voice, from somewhere.

In a state of stunned amazement I am, whenever the camera or microphone goes anywhere near him in this, and usually for some days after, just basking in the memories of it. Days pass and my anticipation of what he will do next, and /how/ he will do it, grows exponentially. No matter how slow or ponderous the shot, I just drink it in like some kind of acting nectar. It's amazing stuff! Try it! 

I've been gushing to all my friends about Mr. Robot, not normally my style. A performance that is almost a week later still frizzling deep trenches in my neural pathways, real memories. Dammit! I've got work to do, man! Family! Leave me alone! 

And holeebuzolee Christian Slater is in it! Who else possesses the insane charisma required to play Mr Robot himself, stomping on the old top of his game like some overused rag. Looks like Hollywood is granting wishes, at last! Thank you. Thank you!

Every particle is in its perfect place, like some orchestral synergy of artistic and technical mastery; a magic show. I haven't been this exited about a second episode since long before I threw my own old-school TV out, many, many years ago. I am completely hook-line-and-sinker into this show.

Waiting for a UK release isn't happening. Downloads are inevitable. Guys! Place a product in it, I'll buy it! Hardware, food, I'll try it! Just get this amazing show out to us!
