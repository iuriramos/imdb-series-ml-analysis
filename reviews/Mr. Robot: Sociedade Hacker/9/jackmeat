My quick rating - 9,0/10. Well, season 1 is over and all I can say is "incredible" I haven't been so enthralled in a show since the first season of 24. The story is so utterly original that cliffhanger week by week is an understatement. There really isn't a fan of anything from action,romance, thriller down to computer geeks that isn't touched upon with this show. (sorry, there weren't any zombies). The acting was near superb in a very frenetic role that Rami Malek tackled with ease. Christian Slater also returns which is a good thing. I have always been a fan and he id a nice job here. I have to be vague, and rate the whole first season in a brief summary. I will give you the IMDb sum up here so you needn't look it up. My advice is watch it, and then come join FSOCIETY.
