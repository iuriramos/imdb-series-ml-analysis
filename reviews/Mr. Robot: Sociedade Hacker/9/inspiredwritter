Mr. Robot takes us for a ride in the world of hacking and real life connections. This isn't a show just about hacking, we immerse with Mr. Robot into hidden world of anonymous hackers. Mr. Robot is an individual diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. The way in which he copes with this disorder is to hack to reach out. An interesting perspective because it highlights societal views on hacking and someone who is doing something without empathy and remorse, yet has a desire to cope and connect to other human beings. I highly recommend seeing this show and seeing for yourself. I've been on the edge of my seat watching it.
