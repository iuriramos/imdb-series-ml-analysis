Definitely worth the watch, it is one of the better TV shows I have watched. It takes an unexpected turn towards the end of the season and was an overall entertaining show. Rami Malek has played the character amazingly and really does look natural in his role. Episode 6 is my favourite throughout the season as it has a huge twist which shows off the directors' ideas. I am also into computing which makes this show much more enjoyable, and having the ability to hack into peoples lives looks like a very interesting concept as he can do practically anything he wants by accessing peoples' private lives. I cannot wait until season 2 and I do not have any clue as to what will happen because of the cliffhanger at the end of season 1. I would highly recommend this to a friend.
