I watched the first episode of Mr. Robot and then I had to watch it again. This is one of the first times that I wasn't sure where a show was going and I'm still not sure. The show is very gritty and strange with almost no good characters. The narration sometimes gets to be too much but is part of the draw of the show. I love seeing Christian Slater back on TV and Gloria Reuben back on TV. Rami Malek is interesting as is his character Elliot. I find that at the end of the episode I have more questions than answers so it will be fun to see where this goes and if they can keep up the suspense. Definitely not a show for people who don't want to think.
