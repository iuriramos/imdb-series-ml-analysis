While there is one episode which I don't consider to be all too stellar in the first season, the entire series so far is some of the most entertaining content I have watched since Game of Thrones and Narcos on Netflix. Not only is the choice of Rami Malek as the main actor splendid because of how effectively he displays his character's emotions, but so is Carly Chaikin as his strangely hot partner in crime. Watching them both on screen becomes addictive especially when you consider how brilliantly the story evolves with the audience's understanding of just how deep the main character's psychological problems go. How Elliott's self-destructive personality ends up devastating the whole of society through a surprisingly realistic portrayal of hacking and the fragility of our society's institutions is the cherry on the sundae and becomes incredibly thought-provoking. I cannot recommend this series enough.
