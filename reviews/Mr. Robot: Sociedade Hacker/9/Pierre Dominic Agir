It all begins with a cautionary voice. A voice that invites you to listen to his reality and introduces you as the imaginary audience. That you, whoever is listening will come face to face with THE truth of your own existence. Although that voice insists that you are merely a figment of his imagination, who's to say that he's actually sane. Welcome to a blurry, tech savvy-filled thriller drama that is Mr. Robot. Where reality is not a question of who, but a question of being one. Where the imaginary is not a question of what, but is answered to be as our preconditioned ideas of the human condition. The endgame of it all, the fruit of all these manipulated narratives will leave you right back to first few lines of Elliot, "Hello friend. Maybe I should give you a name. But that's a slippery slope. You're only in my head". And ultimately realize. In this world ran by Capitalism, ARE YOU REAL?
