Quite a nice series. Was surprised to see Christian slater - have not seen him since 'The broken arrow'. Crisp and smart dialogue. A bit cheesy and overboard sometimes with the 'To be' CTO of Evil corp punching a homeless man to death to vent of his frustration. I don't think there is any series running that has the same potential as this one. Rami Malek has given a very good performance of a lonely genius who is very disturbed and who sees the world for what it is. The rest of the characters are only loosely bounded with some sticking out starkly. Hopefully the writers brisk them up in the future episodes. It might not deserve the 9+ it currently has but certainly amongst the top 5 shows on air. Can not help noticing the fact that the idea is based on 'Fight club' with probably the entire character of Christian slater ending up as a figment of our heroes imagination based on his fathers memory.
