It would be incredibly hyperbolic to call this show one of the best shows on TV with just one episode under its belt, but it could be that great. It beautifully uses the voice-over device (a device oftentimes referred to as a "cheap trick" in Hollywood) to display the protagonist's philosophical "hacktivist" views. Rami Malek is perfect as he nails Elliot's anti-social tendencies as if he were a loner himself. Elliot's characterization is so well-handled that it could carry the show alone, but it throws in many existential and political questions that almost make you wonder if the world Elliot lives in is the same one we live in (it most likely is but still). If people can appreciate the thematically centered plot, this is going to be a huge hit and could give the USA network its first real big shot at some major critical acclaim.
