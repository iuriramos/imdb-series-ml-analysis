Finally a series that points out how our society is. Sam Esmail fearlessly points out the state of the present scenario of the society that is being swallowed by the corporate world. A hacker faced with the dilemma of going with the flow or going against the flow, Rami Malek portrays Elliot Anderson with a great ease that confuses the audience with the fact whether Rami Malek is actually the character. This film also portrays all walks of the society and the problems related to it. 

This complete series enlighten the audience with the fact that the corporate world rules, while the common folks are just cattle that is being tamed by the boss, the corporate world itself. The series also portrays the people's dilemma in accepting their sexuality and their fear for coming out with the truth.

This show deserves all the appreciation because it ACTUALLY deserves. Unlike showing up some fantasy world that consists of dragons and nudity, depicting present scenario exactly as it is, that is some bold attempt that deserves appreciation. The acting has been well done. Other than some reckless casting, and some negligible mistakes, this show is in fact good and i recommend people reading this to watch it.
