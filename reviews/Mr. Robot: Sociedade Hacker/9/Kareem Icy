I initially liked the show because it matches lots of my philosophical view. However, I fell in love with it because, in my opinion, it's a piece of art. 

This show just oozes art from every aspect. You can produce a good show, that the majority of people would like and enjoy, without being artistic (except for the basics - storyline and acting). In Mr. Robot, however, you can clearly see that an extra mile has been gone at every aspect just to make it a piece of art. 

I'm not going to talk about details about how the plot is good or any basic necessities that makes a show good. This show is a masterpiece and it's pleasant to immerse yourself into every aspect of it. Highly recommended.
