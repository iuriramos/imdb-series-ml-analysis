This is a show worthwhile watching. A series about hacking, but not the usual whiz kids. That helps a lot. The first period was already an eye opener and the characters are as real as they can get. The protagonist has personality problems, which makes him the more acceptable. He knows his way computer systems and is able to dig up all kind of information on others. And how is does is very believable.

I won't go into details in order not to spoil it for other viewers, but I can really recommend it and suggest you lean back and pay very good attention. 

It is certainly not your run of the mill sitcom and requires your attention from the beginning till the end.
