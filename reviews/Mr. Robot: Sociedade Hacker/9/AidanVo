Mr. Robot is one of those rare shows that constantly delivers a sense of suspense and confusion without making it seem too forced or uninspiring. It is about a hacker who suffers from insecurity and a drug addiction, and is seemingly pulled into a plan to hack the system and erase all debt in the country. He ultimately has to face his own morality and psyche to find out the truth of the world and events that transpire around him. 

This show does a great job at keeping us in the dark enough to where we don't know what is happening while still being able to think everything is much simpler than it is. You will be shocked yet satisfied with the final episodes of this first season, and you will want to re- watch the whole show to see how it adds up.

The story is fantastic, and the many supporting characters and their arcs make for a great bigger picture. My personal favorite character is Tyrell due to the overall mystery of his motives and plans. He is someone who constantly seems to teeter between protagonist and antagonist as the show progresses. He is basically the Tyrian Lannister of Mr. Robot; he has his own motive and is unarguably an awesome character.

I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who loves a good mystery with interesting characters and plot. #where'sTyrell?
