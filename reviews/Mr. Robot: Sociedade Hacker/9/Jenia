I remember the first time i heared about Mr robot , it had only 2 or 3 episodes out and as a "not so big of a fan" of Rami Malek and pretty boring Summery of the plot i decided to let it go .And boy was i wrong , i don't recall how i've decided to watch the first episode but i sure can recall how it got me hooked up from the first couple of minutes through the episode. Megical thing i've discovered about this show is that you don't need to fully understand what is going on , it somehow gets you hooked up ,maybe because this show shows us something that can happen in real life? i don't know but i watched almost the whole first season in a heart beat. Sure there are sometimes when it gets a little boring but the showmakers seem to know what they are doing and it works perfectly . I strongly recommend it to everyone , the acting is A+ and the plot is awesome , i hope they will keep it on the same level when the 3rd season comes out , oh well im sure they will.
