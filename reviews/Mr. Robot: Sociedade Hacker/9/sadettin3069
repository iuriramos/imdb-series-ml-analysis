The show is about the life of the man who is both hacker in nights and IT technician in days. The main character Eliot has also physiological disorders and not much friends except Angela who dates someone he disliked. Eliot is good at hacking instead of making friends and communicating people and he uses his skill for reveal bad guys' secrets on the internet. Also he have to deal with loneliness that beyond an illness and he is abnormally delusional sometimes. He hates society and he disliked illusions of social media and all fake happiness. 

Furthermore the thing in the show I loved more is inside voice of the main characters. it reminds me Dexter and his inside and humorist voice and Eliot hold back an item of the his target likewise Dexter's blood samples. Moreover he is just like dexter criminal in nights and normal people in days. Maybe I am exaggerated but the similarities is more than you think. Eliot chooses his target according to some moral codes and he don't give a dame about money too. Another reason why I liked the series more is the purpose of the hacking itself and activist discourse of the hacking group. Also after Mr robot talks Eliot and Eliot mentions about evil corporations, it reminds me Fight Club and culture imperialism. 

So that TV show has great potential to expand its scope rather than just tells an hacker's life story. For the first episode I extremely enjoy with it and I definitely recommend the show to you. I'm sure that It is worth it for your time instead of other dummy garbage TV operas.
