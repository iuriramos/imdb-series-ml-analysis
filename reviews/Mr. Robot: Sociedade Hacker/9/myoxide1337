I give this show a 9.4/10, and Shows like The Walking Dead, and True Detectives S01 are similar ratings in my critic book in my mind. I always tell myself I don't have time to write a review, but this show, for being on Cable Television and not a premium network such as HBO, This program should be backed by some more important people. Not saying everyone involved in this show is awesome, but you got Rami Malek, and Christian Slater, This show has you on the edge of your seat because of the fast paced narrating, and the relative feelings and emotions flowing through each character such as the main actor. Taking Morphine, and using Subutex so he doesn't withdrawal. The writers are involved in today's trends, and vices all of us Americans struggle with, including us Internet or should I say Inter web 1337 people. It's not a hacker, matrix, like The Chosen One type of show like a lot of people judging a show by its poster thinks. The main actors can read and relate and seek justice through using his skills of computer networking hacking and coding. he uses languages and his Virtual Private Network to seek out not only making child predators go down, but he wants to take down the BIG E Corporation which reminds me of ENRON in a way. Mix up the Spider-man, Evil Corp that Spider goes up against with a secret society such as Anon, and you got this new age computer hacker genre that keeps you on the edge of your seat if you are familiar with any of today gossip and trends. ANTISOCIAL means F*&& THE GOVERNMENT and I am sure a lot of us feel that way! GO MALEK!
