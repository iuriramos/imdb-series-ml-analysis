I know... Even if Mr. Robot has (steals?) the same plot of fractured mind-doppelganger-split personality when main character's mental state went deteriorated and his mind formed a new personality as in Chuck Palahniuk & David Fincher's book and movie respectively. 

It's a good show only because is well acted, produced, written, directed and produced. It's obvious Sam Esmail is a devoted watcher of TV and Movies, his show is very influenced by it as he uses the first person talking like the "Narrator" and pays some tributes to icons like Pulp Fiction as well. 

Rami Malek is cool, even in Edward Norton's '99 shoes... Christian Slater as the new version of Tyler Durden is fine, he always had been a good actor anyways. And the secondary characters are a good ensemble. Hooray for Carly Chaikin (Darlene) a kind of Marla Singer, Martin Wallstr√∂m is so nuts and and a personal quote if I may... I love Stephanie Corneliussen (Joanna)

Hope the quality in the second season don't came with low quality of plots and subplots.
