Mr. Robot takes you for a ride in the world of hacking and connections shrouded in mystery and rebellion. Hacking that actually looks legitimate on screen. 

We immerse with Mr. Robot into the world of hacktivism. Our main character, Elliot, is diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and it's interesting to watch how he copes and unfolds. Rami Malek and Christian Slater kill it with their performances. 

Director Niels Arden Oplev and Writer Sam Esmail take you on a journey that's written with intelligence and thrill in mind.

I recommend giving this show a view.
