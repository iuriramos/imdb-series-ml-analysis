Conspiracy thrillers are a favourite of mine but this one represents what could be the pinnacle in that genre, and I've only watched one episode! The casting of Rami Malek as Elliot is perfect, he plays the socially awkward and terminally lonely hacker in a manner that is so utterly convincing it makes me feel uncomfortable.

Even down to the music the atmosphere of this pilot episode is one of intensity and underlying angst that creates a real sense of foreboding and darkness.

Mr Robot says to Elliot at one point "Let me tell you why you're really here. You're here because you sense something wrong with the world". Yes, very much so. And if the rest of the series is like this then I will certainly be watching it, avidly!
