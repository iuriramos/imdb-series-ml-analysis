I started watching this as a person who is quit into technology and i loved it immediately, the main character Elliot is very like-able and you understand his problems very quickly. The story line in season one is, complicated but simple enough to understand.

Each Episode you learn something major and it seems like its set in stone, you create a view on it, but then next episode it changes, this program really makes you think. I enjoyed it a lot i loved season one but in season two it started to get even more complicated, this is fine for me as i love that sort of stuff, but it does get a bit much at times. 

Overall i think the only way or you to know i its or you is to give it a try, this programme is so complicated that you can kind o make it your own, so give it a try
