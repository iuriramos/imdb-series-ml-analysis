My first impression of Mr. Robot is simply that it is a Great Show, Originally, being an ethical hacker myself, I was skeptical as to the show being not only accurate but captivating in a way that wasn't stereotypical or made me feel as if I had seen it ten times before. Instead, I was delighted to find that I was so completely wrong! The show enriches itself with (some) accuracy, and has a certain breaking bad, man-of-few-words feel to it; with many complex emotions being expressed subtly. The only thing that I can't get past with this show is the name. Though it IS being marketed to mainstream audiences, a small part of me can't stand that such an extraordinary show that strives to deviate from the norm with these conspiracy-types would have a name that suggests just the opposite. Other than this, the show features brilliant acting and character development. I can't wait for the next episode!
