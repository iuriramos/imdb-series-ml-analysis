This show has ambition like I've never seen. It's an intensely introspective character development of a highly unstable but fairly moral individual. It's on the scope of Breaking Bad, but even less afraid of not fitting a mold. It lost me an episode or two with some rather chaotic story-telling, but I've come to realize that all the threads are actually weaving together. My fear is that they won't have enough fuel to carry multiple seasons, but then that's how I felt about Breaking Bad as well.

A real highlight are the short intimate scenes between even minor roles. Touching and very real. You quickly care for even the minor players. The story telling is masterful.
