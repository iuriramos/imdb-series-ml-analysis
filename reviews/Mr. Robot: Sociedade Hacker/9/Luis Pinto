I'm reviewing the pilot, and although I found it excellent, this is almost the Matrix verbatim without all the martial arts and science fiction setting. Main guy is the equivalent of Neo and Christian Slater is Morpheus. Both want to free mankind from an oppressing conglomerate (Evil Corp), the one that controls all the money and student loans :). The guys in the black suit are also there, and there's also a nemesis. Where this excels over the matrix, is the purpose and dialog. This time around both sides have purposes that make sense, not a forced mambo jumbo about machines using humans as biological batteries.. Main character (Neo) has a hero complex but in a very twisted and creepy kinda of way, he's also very anti-social and a very good hacker.

Being a coder and a Linux user myself, technically the show is doing the right thing and talking about the right stuff. This is no CSI Cyber :) 

Let's see how this goes from here, I was really really pleasantly surprised by this! 10 minutes into the show I was immediately hooked, let's see if they keep up in the next episodes!
