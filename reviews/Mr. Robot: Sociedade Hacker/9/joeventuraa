As noted, the pilot was epic! Brilliant really. You have to just flow with this show and it will hit. The only other actor I could see that would come close to Rami Malek might be Wentworth Miller. Rami Malek is just brilliant. No questions asked. He is so inside this character you can't believe this isn't really him. That's incredible acting as an art form. 

There is a some really deep ideas presented in this show. The writing is high IQ. How about Elliott's first session with his therapist. The social commentary is spot on. What we have here is writing that reflects what most of us feel and communicate usually through various outlets. This commentary would fuel most of talk radio and political TV for years and is the underbelly of so many religious and political debate.

Elliott's inner dialogue is so real and well performed. This is hard to do and mesh with real time. Some of the back and forth between Elliot and Angela offer great platforms for any relationship like, "Stop thinking about something else when I'm talking to you!" Who hasn't dealt with this and just let it go, but after, it lingers until you just fade away from someone. There's a lot of these little tidbits. Looking forward to where this show develops.
