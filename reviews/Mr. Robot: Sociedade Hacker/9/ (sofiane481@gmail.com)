Serial talks about the personal performance of Elliot (Rami Malek), which speaks of being somewhat socially troubled people face problems in communicating with other people, but Mo as bad Elly makes it very strange phases, it appears to the viewer as someone bigger than that.

After the second episode appreciate I say that the series presented himself strongly As one of the best television business this year Labour productivity is excellent value and level of writing And to more thing I liked is that the series in the construction phase from scratch However moments of boredom is almost non-existent For this I wrote in my blog about the subject www.psychopass.tk

thank you
