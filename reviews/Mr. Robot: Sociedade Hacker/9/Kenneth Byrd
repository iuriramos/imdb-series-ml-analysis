This show works on so many levels and as a result you really don't need to be into computers or hacking etc.. to enjoy. If you do know your networks you will find that it stays within the boundaries of reality unlike many hacking shows/movies. If you remove the geeky elements you are still left with a gripping drama with good expected and unexpected twists. 

Great casting (I'm a Slater fan but beyond that aspect of it the actors really do the character justice. The writing is also strong and I personally like that they do try to keep the hacking aspects fairly believable.

Definitely worth a try!
