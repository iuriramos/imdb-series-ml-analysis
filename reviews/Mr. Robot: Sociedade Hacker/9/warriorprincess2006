One of the most groundbreaking and unique series of all time! All of the characters have immense depth and the plot line is the most unique of any TV show in decades! Rami Malek is brilliant as "Elliott," and Portia Doubleday as "Angela" is intense. Grace Gummar as the FBI agent investigating the Five/Nine-FSociety event is sheer perfection. And, BD Wong as Whiterose is one of the most honest and remarkable portrayals of a transgender character I've seen thus far. Honestly, all of the characters are intriguing. Casting director deserves a huge nod!!! I must admit I'm completely bored with Joanna's character...so, PLEASE bring Tyrell's character back...he was the most interesting by far!!! Can't wait to see what happens next season! I have high hopes that this series lasts a while...so completely relevant to modern day technology and its potentially devastating effects. Mad, twisted, brilliant and addictive!!!
