Sam Esmail is a genius, great acting Of all the cast especially Rami Malek The character was born for Elliot, This show is one of the most interesting things I've seen on TV ever. Once you think you've seen enough, the next episode comes along and blows the previous one away it is mind blowing you cant Watch what's coming its amazing. This story told through the eyes of a misfit is a treat for every thinking human being who questions the rationale of a society burning in turmoil over the many forms of inequity existing in our world today the first season was amazing and the second season was even better that it is rare, since Breaking Bad was not confined to that screen Brilliant, engaging, refreshing, tell me you see that too!
