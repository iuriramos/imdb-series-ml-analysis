It's rare not to feel taken for a fool in a fiction. This one is sharp, sensitive, educated. When complexity is usually brought by stupid flash-backs, numerous characters or false leads, here it is only relying on an enlightened perspective on our world. The narrative flowing uncluttered in almost real time is highly subjective due to the main character's sweet voice-over. This paradoxical role is played with complexity, sensitivity and talent. I've noticed that guy a while ago, and I think I've found one of my favorite actors. He is antithesis of the usual hero with a static and stereotyped acting. He is capable of infinitesimal facial expressions that allow him to embody fragile characters with great realism and finesse. I love you Rami! By the way, I'm a computer security expert, and the technical references are quite accurate. I was surprised as realistic computer security is not so sexy. Usually we see people tracked by their GPS or other non-senses. I'm not rating it 10, otherwise, what would I do when it gets better?
