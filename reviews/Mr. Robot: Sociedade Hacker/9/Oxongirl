OK, so there is part of me looking through my old DVD collection including Hackers, The Matrix, The Net and even Die Hard 4.0. However, the brilliant (!!!!) soundtrack, especially the music composed by Mac Quayle, reminding me of a mix of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' works, combined with the fact that the protagonist keeps talking to me as if I was there, plus the actual film work - it's the kind of series you want to watch more and more of - especially as it's twisted enough to leave you discussing it with friends or family over dinner. 

Great to see Christian Slater again after so long - and he's fabulous although a little young to be playing the Dad. The choice of Rami Malek is amazing - what an unusual character. Reminds me of Jack Nicholson in a way, you cannot tell the difference between the personality in the film and in real life. The wait for season 2 seems endless....2016? come on. Hurry up.
