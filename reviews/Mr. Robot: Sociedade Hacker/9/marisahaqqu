This show tells the story of a hero in the IT angle of life accurately (which I've never seen such before). 

It also adds on the issue of the battles we fight are not only on the outside (the world, etc) but it is greater within ourselves (the psychotic problems). 

Plus, it connects directly to viewers as we play the imaginary friends of Elliot.

It is a bit slow in pace which is both good and bad. Good thing is we are able to catch up on what is going on but u may fall asleep watching it.

I couldn't imagine someone else playing Elliot better than Rami Malek so yes he deserves the Emmy. (not to mention those gorgeous eyes)

Brilliant, unique and freshly psychotic. A Must See.
