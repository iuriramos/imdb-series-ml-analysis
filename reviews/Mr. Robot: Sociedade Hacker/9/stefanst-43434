I've always found writing introductions in reviews to be a piece of cake. I usually open with a general impression and then I proceed to pick the film or series apart, carefully pointing out the things that caught my eye. 

This, as you've probably deduced, is an exception. The first season of "Mr. Robot" left me literally speechless, if you exclude the screams of disbelief during the last few episodes.

So, what nerve did "Mr. Robot" strike ? All of them.

Although Rami Malek is the star of the show and, naturally, the spotlight was on him, I feel that the performances of the rest of the cast were severely neglected. I will not single out anyone and there is no doubt that the cast as a whole deserves far more praise than they receive. Another aspect of the show that went relatively unnoticed was the soundtrack. The electro-vibes that can be heard in each episode contribute to the overall feeling of cyberpunk paranoia, but I just can't not mention the use of the piano cover of "Where Is My Head" by the Pixies. The cinematography ? Unusual. I did not know what to make of it but as the series progressed, I came to realize that the weird shots (such as the characters being confined to the very edge of the screen) had much more purpose than what I originally thought was going to be "weird for the sake of weird". As for the the story - nothing (and I mean NOTHING) is unintentional. If you pay attention you might be able to figure out just what is going on, but If you are like me, the second viewing will be as rewarding as the first.

Finally, If you're still having doubts about this show, give the first episode a chance and bid your social life farewell for the next 11 hours or so. 

You will not regret it.
