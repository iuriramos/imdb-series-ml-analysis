Rami Malek has made this series. The story is great (notwithstanding the not-entirely-original plot twists), but this guy is absolutely incredible in this role. There were a few (actually one -incredibly unnecessary) scenes in the first season that detracted from it and they've most likely lost viewers because of it (my wife being one of them), unfortunately. but that aside, I can't stop watching this. Rami is mesmerizing, 10/10 for him alone. I was hooked from the first episode, seriously edge-of-my-seat stuff. Hacker stuff is believable (enough - I use PuTTY/terminal), rest of the characters are excellent, can't wait for the second season!
