This is by far one of the best pilots I have seen in ages!! Being in IT myself it was a breath of fresh air to see that they keep with the real techniques/lingo used by real professionals, and not sensationalized crap that is used in other show like CSI. I hope that the director and the writers stick with this throughout the life of the show. 

The first episode had be hanging on the edge of my seat for the full 60 minutes. I love this show already and I hope to see 100 more seasons! Rami Malek does a fantastic job in his role, full props to him! I wish this show every success that it deserves!

I cannot wait for episode 2 to come out next week, 1 July!!
