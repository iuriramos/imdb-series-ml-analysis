It's basic cable, so I like and expect a bit of cheese with my shows. Mr. Robot didn't give me enough cheese....and that's a good thing. I know its probably coming. They can lay it on a little from episode to episode. This show is cool. You can tell why David Fincher's name is connected to this. Rami Malek is going to be a star. Likable, but dark protagonists are where its at. 

I just came home from my first visit to New York city. Mr. Robot completely captures being in the city, the trains, the coffee shops, and most importantly, the people. What better city to have your character who suffers from anti-social disorder bounce around it? 

USA network, you have my attention
