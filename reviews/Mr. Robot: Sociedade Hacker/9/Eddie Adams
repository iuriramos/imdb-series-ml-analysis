Rami Maleck is TV's newest obsession in USA's thrilling new techno drama Mr.Robot.With echoes and tones of the Matrix and the best use of voice-over in any film medium in years,Mr Robot debuts incredibly strong and surpassing viewer expectations.

The pilot is superbly directed by Niel Arden Oplec who no doubt draws upon his 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' experience, and correctly does so.However,the true winner is Maleck who owns every frame of the 64 minute drama,seducing the audience with his eerie charisma ,which is as addicting as it is captivating.Without apology,his character,Elliot is the show's biggest attraction and the plot is secondary.

Nevertheless, the plot is novel,feels fresh and is moving, leaving viewers with lots of unanswered questions,which clearly can only be answered by continued viewer-ship.In the technical department,the cinematography/visual photography is perfectly suited for and enhances the series.The director's choice of dull colors and a combination of bluish tan helps the viewer to see how Elliot perceives the world and is one of the show's better element.And did I mention-it has a killer script? It seems like Suits has found it self a good companion series on USA.In the words of Elliot "I hope I am not the only one seeing this."
