Well. I was really waiting for something like this. Most of the TV series that I watched earlier had few connections with real 'hacking' and stuff, but none of them were solely based on the very idea of it.The director David Fincher has a bunch of great movies in his bag like Gone Girl, The Social Network, Seven, Fight Club, and not to forget The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, where the character of Lisbeth Salander resembles Elliot. There are few places where you could feel a bit dizzy, but the idea behind the story is fine. Elliot, a Sociopath, is able to see and read people but cannot speak his mind, the solution for this problem: Hacking> Hacking those people is his way of connecting with them. Its amazingly intriguing and I would strongly (like very strongly) recommend this one.
