Actually this show really surprised me in a good way. I enjoy the mix of emotions then the use of plot around them.

I think it was done very well and loved how they portrayed the computers in this episode. I often get tired of shows that insist on showing the inside of a computer etc; for me it just not needed.

This show takes you on a ride; literally. A beautifully well written show that made me want to watch what happens next time. 

I have watched a ton of TV shows and I am looking forward to seeing more of this series.

This looks at hacking from a very different perspective. So be warned; if you are used to Hollywood's insistence on showing the inside of a computer; you will only get the inside the mind. Of which, I applaud the director's approach.
