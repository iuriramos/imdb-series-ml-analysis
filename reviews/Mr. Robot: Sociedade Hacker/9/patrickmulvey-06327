Fans of the long-lived Dexter series will immediately feel something familiar in Mr. Robot. The similarities are many, the main characters are detached anti-social oddities, strangely unable to emotionally connect with those around them. They are techies by day and vigilantes by night. They basically want to be good people even though they do things that are illegal or socially unacceptable. Dexter was cursed with needing to kill. Elliot is cursed with the meaningless of a world seemingly controlled by others.

Dexter uses his official access to databases to zoom in on a target and then surveils them live. Elliot uses his hacking skills to do likewise. Both choose a punishment that fits the crime of their targets. They each seek to expunge injustices. Neither wants any extensive involvement with their targets, just instant and irrevocable justice.

The routine soliloquy of questioning reality and what is being experienced is almost identical for each of them. Elliot is more playful in that his hallucination is addressed directly to the audience. 

There are also similarities in directorial technique. The way that pop music ducks under dialogue and then overlays it. The way that conversations happen and then, when you can't believe he actually said that, it is revealed as a virtual dream sequence. 

Audiences will be rooting for the awkward Elliot, just as Dexter fans wanted him to prevail. It is an excellent show with a pilot that will hook you.
