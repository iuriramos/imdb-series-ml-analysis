I, like many other reviewers of this programme, was quite sceptical launching myself into this on Amazon prime after scrolling through recommended TV Shows to watch. Let me start off my calling some of the other reviews wrong.

You don't need to be a techie to like this. I am certainly not. All of the hacking stuff that was mentioned I did not understand, however I did not feel as though either this impaired my ability to understand the plot nor inhibit my enjoyment of it. I am also sure that the programmes creators did not intend it to in the first place either.

It was really fascinating the role of Elliot develop as the series went on. I liked the way he used the audience to (sort of) explain what was going on in his head and the reasoning for his actions. You start off thinking you understand everything, then by about episode 6 you feel as though you understand nothing. I also think this was intended. Don't be discouraged, as it all makes sense in the end.

I loved the breath of fresh air the main character brought. To be honest, I get bored very easily at the predictable, dull, one- dimensional characters that other Hollywood generic films and shows bring out. Instead, we get a view of a socially inept, shy guy, whose development throughout the series is one of the most intriguing bits.

I warn you, whatever the ending you conjure up in your mind, it will be way off.

In conclusion: Watch it.
