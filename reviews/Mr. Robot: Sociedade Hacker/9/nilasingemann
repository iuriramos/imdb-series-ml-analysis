It thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Robot, it might be one of the best series i have watched since True Detective. the visuals is appealing and smooth, which give the series a nice look and as a result of this, gives it a modern look. It's a welcomed break in the whole reboots, spin-offs and ongoing downwards spiral, that have come to original content in the television industry. This is for me, an unprecedented plot, with clear connections to its makers intension and previous works. 

If you want something, that is not bound by the TV-standard of plot, character arcs, and the copy-paste mentality of modern, big-budget TV-series; this is for you.

In the pilot you are completely asking yourself, what is real, how can i trust what i see. You become a part of the series, in a way, that you feel like a active part supporting Elliot on his journey. Not his journey to take down the big company, (which as i see it, may be a supporting plot line, but his journey to figure out what is real. 

I can't stress it enough, this might be the most original idea of 2015.
