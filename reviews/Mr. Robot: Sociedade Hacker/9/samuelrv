When I first heard about this series I thought "it must be another Hollywood garbage with unrealistic-2seconds NASA hacking and stuff", but...WOW! Mr. Robot is one of those memorable, fun, intense and heart touching series that I was needing (Breaking Bad I still miss you ='( ). The direction is awesome, I caught myself almost punching my computer screen in some intense moments. The cast is really good too, you can easily forget you're watching a television series if you don't watch out! And the story...! Completely great and catching! I STRONGLY recommend this series. If you want to watch something you wont forget after the first episode or after your whole life, watch this.
