Oooo, has Christian Slater in it thinks me, maybe worth a look.

Only 2 episodes have been released so far, yet it has a score of 9,4? Bit weird.

So, I watched both them and have given it = 2/10 Yet another inflated score bumped up no doubt by the cast and editing staff.

Yes just 2, what a weak drawn out mess in the 2 episodes. I must admit the first one virtually drew me in.. the second though..No A semi believable storyline with endless drawn-out side plots. Tedious in the extreme. Hate to say actors are weak and I am not one myself but.

Why has this really got a score of 9.4? Honestly.?
