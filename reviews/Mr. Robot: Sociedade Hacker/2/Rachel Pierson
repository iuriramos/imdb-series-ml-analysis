Seriously, is this bad rip off of War Games and Fight Club a joke? It's a shaggy dog story that moves tediously slowly towards incredibly obvious story arcs that even a moron could see coming a mile off. Not to mention the technicals are wildly off. I've been a software developer in high-security environments for about 30 years now. A DDoS attack wouldn't even cause someone to bat an eyelid, let alone leap out of bed in the middle of the night. It's the kind of japes that Script Kiddies get up to. Yet here, it's presented as a highly-skilled feat that makes the stereotypically-autistic antihero go googly-eyed. Puh-lease. And confronting paedophiles face-to-face, so closely that you actually brush shoulders with the police on the way out? Yeah, someone that was careful enough to work in cyber security would totally take that silly risk. For sure.

Give this one a miss, chaps. It's dumb beyond belief, and dull as dishwater.
