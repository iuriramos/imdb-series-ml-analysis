the show is obviously trying to connect with friend-zoned nerds, who think they always know better than everyone else.

like they are the only one who understand who's in control.

with themes like Illuminati and programming it's obvious they are trying to attract those small minded ( though to them they are the only smart people and the rest are sheep), antisocial programmers who sit on their computer all day long stalking or playing sky-rim and never go out and interact with people and then complain that all of them are stupid, bigoted and intentionally ignorant.

it's just too cheap.

although the plot is kinda interesting.
