OK, so the first and the second episode were really GOOD! Something new and refreshing, but as soon as we see that he's just a junkie- geek-looser it started to go down down down down into the trash can.

How could the ruin a show with so much potential with the psychopath plot. Come on!? Couldn't you come up with something new, something original, so you gave us a psychopath/junkie?! Ahhh so mad at this! They are doing the same with FearTheWalking dead, like all the young people today are drug addicts... 

If they would stay with the computer and hacker side of the story this would be a 10/10 show, but it's only a 2/10 now...

So sad...will probably not watch season2, unless they decide to leave this crap in the past and concentrate on the technology, plot twists, politics, economy etc...
