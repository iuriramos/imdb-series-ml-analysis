I am so bored by season 2. Too much focus on seeing the world through his lens so we are constantly stuck inside Elliott's head. Very little light is shed on the world post fsociety apocalypse. Probably the show runner (looking at you Sam Esmail) is having a hell of a great time making sure that every detail is exactly as he envisioned it but for the viewer, it is at best, tolerable. I get that we are inside Elliott's not fully diagnosed mind but it is becoming unnecessarily claustrophobic and nothing ever happens (at least not in real life or TV life). 

Dear USA, don't pass the reins completely to one creative tyrant. you are suffocating the viewer!
