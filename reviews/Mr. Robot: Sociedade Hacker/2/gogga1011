I have watched many shows and movies like this. Hackers and similar are presented always the same - somewhat misunderstood, depressive, very smart, antisocial and of course anxious with tendencies to suicide, drugs and other stimulants. (Ofcourse, Slater doesn't exist, if you asked for) And story about big "evil corp" and fight against it is also seen million times... but that's all OK, tolerably. Something much worse bothers me. Or to say - buggin' me? I am asking why pushing someone's sexual preference in all series for young people? I'm surprised that the Jews, who are usually producers of almost all TV series in USA and a very rigorous on issues of homosexuality pushed this shameless display of almost pornographic, homosexual acts. While many today are afraid to say this: me personally, I'm disgusted with that and I think it's wrong, it's not good to push constantly in all series. No more series where at least no bare butt, gay or lesbo sex, even unhidden vagina and penis, in full motion. What's next - open sexual acts at 5 pm in the program for young children? The producers of the series in the third episode of Mr.Robot are just a step away from pure gay pornography and so now I will stop watch this show and I would not recommend to anyone. But I know you Americans do not understand why we are against it, because you are brainwashed with thousands of similar gay-ish pictures through all media, for decades now. They started with soft-porn, just some legs and tits, and now in USA everything is just sex, sex, sex... Sex sale everything, to stupid masses. I don't care if you are homosexual or not, or whatever you are, just leave me and my children be. Thank you.
