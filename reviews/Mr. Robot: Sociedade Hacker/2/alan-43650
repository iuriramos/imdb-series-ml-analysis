The show started out with so much potential but slowly and steadily degenerated into more of the same sick and violent programming that we see everywhere else. Talk about taking a concept and trashing it for all it worth. Its overwhelmed with drugs and violence to the point of being the ultimate "bad trip" film series. This time with a psycho hacker backdrop. The cerebral aspects of the show could have been developed with modern day events providing a template such as those involving Edward Snowden and Kim Dotcom or those involved with the development of the crypto currency Bitcoin. As the show stands it should be renamed "the revenge of the drugged Apocalypse zombie hackers."
