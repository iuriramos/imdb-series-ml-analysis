I hung in there hoping Season 1 would become a truly gripping and insightful story about technology and it's big brother presence in our daily lives and how dangerous that is for both the public at large and the corporate structures that are so reliant on it. No dice. I watched the entire Season 1 episodes back-to-back and was flabbergasted at the shallowness of this series. First off, Malek's wooden performance is a dead giveaway early on to one of the weak surprise reveals. Second, the sub plots of the ghetto drug culture and homosexuality were blatantly obvious fillers to widen the demographic net, probably foisted on the writers by the network execs. None of it added to the story. The insidious perversity in this story really lies with the executive management goals of E Corp and that was barely examined as an encompassing and destructive aspect of current society. While we heard some very articulate - great writing here! - complaints with the inner monologues of the lead, not much time was devoted to the real impact of monopolies and their greed, data breaches, and the human disconnect that has electronic chatter replacing social engagement. Lastly, I'm not a techie so I can't comment on the technical accuracy, but I'm doubtful that the crash could have happened as shown here. If it's this easy to get into high security buildings, break through firewalls, enlist the Chinese, etc., etc., then we are ALL - not just corporations - in big trouble and this was not addressed at all. That's where the real story & suspense would be. My 2 stars are for the "attempt" at something meaningful, even though it failed. I don't understand all the high ratings - is it spoofing?
