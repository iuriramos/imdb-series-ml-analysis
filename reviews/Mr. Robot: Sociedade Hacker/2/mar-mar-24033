What is all this fuss about anti-capitalism shows these days. The pilot and the environment could have led to a great show but the more we advance into the story the worst it gets. 

The side story with Angela Moss is just dull and full of clich√©s. 

The only good side story is the one with Tyrell Wellick. Sure he's evil and there are lots of reasons to hate him but he's the only interesting character that I actually like. 

In brief this show is tremendously overrated on IMDb. I started watching it because of its ratings, but regretted it after the first episode. And it kept getting worst
