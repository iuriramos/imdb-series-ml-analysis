After episode 10, I took a 3 month break from giving this show another attempt to finish the season. I finally tried to watch episode 11 last night. I turned it off 15 minutes before the ending. I've never seen anything start out so promising then crash and burn so badly. It seems the writers are writing it as they go. There's no direction. The entire cast seem bored by episode 8 or 9 wondering "Where is this all going?" They must be because the acting goes completely downhill by episode 11. I think they just want it all to be over with. It's pretty bad when the most unlikable characters are the protagonists and the most interesting are the sociopath Swedish couple. This show started off like a David Fincher film then careened off into M. Night Shyamalan territory. Huge disappointment!
