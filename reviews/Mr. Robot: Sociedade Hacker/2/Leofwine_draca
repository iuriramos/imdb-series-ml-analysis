Review of Season One: 

The first episode of MR. ROBOT was cracking stuff. It promised a hacking-based conspiracy thriller with lots of corporate espionage, suspense, and anarchic plots to bring down capitalist society. It looked to be a show to make hacking both fun and suspenseful. Basically, it had potential in spades. So what happened? The second episode was only average by comparison, and by the third episode I wasn't really enjoying it anymore. And then the large and rather important plot twists started hitting, and I realised that MR. ROBOT wasn't original at all, and not even about hacking. Instead it's a cheap, generic, left-wing rip-off of similar movie fare like FIGHT CLUB and V FOR VENDETTA, a series more concerned with pushing a liberal agenda than telling a real story.

THE PACIFIC's Rami Malek is a good choice for lead, all bug eyes and angst, but his acting begins to get more and more over the top as the series progresses. Christian Slater is always a welcome presence in either film or TV but is sorely underutilised. The rest of the cast is made up of unpleasant characters, from the airhead blonde would-be girlfriend to the dirty, unpleasant, and sullen fellow hackers who are so rude that you want them all to be erased from the screen. I was really disappointed by all the wasted potential here, and the way the writers go down all-too-familiar routes instead of creating something genuinely fresh and new. By the time MR. ROBOT finishes, it has become the most pretentious drivel ever, and exactly the type of show I hate.
