I've been working in IT for 20+ years so I think I know a bit (just a bit) about that world. I couldn't even bear myself to even finish the first episode, is THAT bad.

There are some references that looked like someone just searched "IT jokes" and decided to put them in the mouth of this guy.

If you like/work in IT don't watch this... is horrible; is even worse than Nikita using IPs with octets over 2000.

Oh! And the main character is supposed to be autistic or genius or something, whilst the only thing he shows is ignorance... again, those searches about "IT jokes" were done by the intern otherwise I don't understand it.
