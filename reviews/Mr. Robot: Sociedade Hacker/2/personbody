I have watched it up to the third episode to find out why the IMDb rating is so goddamn high and I have still not found out why. I cannot go five minutes watching an episode without almost killing myself in frustration about how the writers cannot at least come up without a good dialogue. cinema blend's review of it as damn near perfect is what even pisses me off the most how can a series that terrible be rated so highly? I'm not much of a series person but the few that I watch are a lot better that this and their rating is not even as high. I'm talking about The Flash, Arrow and Silicon Valley. I mean, come on!, who names a series Mr Robot? In the third episode when the "Mr Robot" met Malek in the office, I was disappointed at how something like that could even happen. I mean, were there no other workers?, couldn't he have called security?, I mean, the guy just tried to kill you!. While watching the first episode, I was hoping that it would live up to the high rating because at the time, it was 9.5 which is pretty goddamn high for a new series, I was not happy at the end of that episode, i watched the second one with hopes that it would be better or at least, watch the rating drop substantially, I was disappointed at the end of that episode too. The third episode just killed me, I couldn't finish watching it because I could not stomach my frustration anymore and had to pour out my anger somewhere before it drives me to kill myself, or somebody. The absolute truth in a nutshell is that I'm disappointed.
