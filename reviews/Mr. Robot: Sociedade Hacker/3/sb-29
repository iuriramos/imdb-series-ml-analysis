I was fooled by some media article that said that this show had realistic technology for a change, but actually, the technology is just the same bullshit but with real software screenshots instead of purely made up, and from realism point of view is not much better than 24 was.

The plot started off in some kind of direction and then just went off into character development of the uninteresting and unlikable characters.

Seems as if each episode was written from scratch with no specific end point on the horizon. Remember when writers had an idea about what the story was about before they started writing ?

I swore I wouldn't watch season 2 after the dismal season 1, but here I am on episode 3 of season 2, and I just finally have to switch it off. I don't think anyone touched a computer so far, Tyrell the most interesting character has vanished, and some of the other interesting actors have been replaced by far more annoying people.

How this garbage made it to season 3 is beyond me. Can we all just please stop watching it, then it will go away and its budget could be used for more interesting stuff.
