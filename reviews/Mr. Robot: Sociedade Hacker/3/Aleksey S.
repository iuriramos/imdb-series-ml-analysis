The pilot centers around Elliot, 20-something guy who probably has a form of high-functioning autism, which isolates him from society, makes him withdraw into the world of computers, and he naturally becomes a genius hacker.

There have been a number of shows and films about people who are not NT(neurotypical), like "Monk" and "Numbers" and "Beautiful Mind", and even the martial arts film "Chocolate" - however, they managed to portray their heroes as sympathetic. After all, if you don't sympathize with the hero, what's supposed to hold your interest? In this show, nothing does.

This dude reads private Emails of people he "protects" (without their consent, of course). He has no life, at all, and therefore lives through controlling THEIRS, in textbook example of severe, long-neglected, codependence syndrome.

He believes work is slavery and corporations are the slave owners. 

He wants "redistribution of wealth". The idea of erasing people's credit card debts makes him feel funny in the pants. Because it's not your responsibility to decide to borrow or manage your finances, no - it's the "corporation's fault".

This show would've been welcomed with open arms in my former homeland - USSR - just as any show that bashed capitalism or showed the West in a bad light. We lived without toilet paper, but at least we were free of corporations who produce it!

But I digress...

The show portrays Elliot as some sort of righteous warrior, but really he's an overgrown child.

We're supposed to sympathize with him not because of his personality - he has none - but because of his mental condition. The show does the autism spectrum no favors here by showing the hero as socially crippled, with minimal life skills, and drowning in angst.

Instead of portraying autistics as "different", it shows him as "broken", with no real outstanding character qualities or insights to compensate for his flaws. Yes, he can hack. At society's expense.

Not only is this show's "hero" a creepy simpleton, the overeager simplicity infects the entire show.

His friend, who works with him at a CYBERSECURITY COMPANY, doesn't know what a ROOTKIT is. He has to explain it to her, because, apparently, she's stupid because... she's a woman? Really? 

The "enemy" in this show is the ambiguous, all-controlling "E CORP", which is constantly referenced verbally as "EvilCorp". Yes, really.

The evil CTO of "EvilCorp" is MOST DEFINITELY evil because he talks rudely to the hero's friend.

The hero goes to psychiatrist, who genuinely tries to help him. Instead, he, despite being chock-full of psychological issues, zones out during her visits and thinks about the photos he saw after hacking into her Facebook.

So the hero hacks his psychiatrists' new date. The date is a BAD GUY, because he has a wife, history of cheating, and he pulled up his dog by the leash when the dog misbehaved.

The dog trait was given to him to make him, you know, EVIL.

The hero has to protect his psychiatrist from this "self-destructive dating pattern", while being completely oblivious just how messed up, creepy and delusional HE is.

The show starts with by preaching about the "1% of the 1%"... i.e. "down with the bourgeoisie!", and it never really stops. It is aimed at the easily impressionable, the idealistic, the college students who don't understand work, or financial responsibility, and believe world history started when they were born.

Down with the system! Down with the corporations!

Of course, the show itself was made by a corporation and is aired thanks to a corporation, and it was made to make money from the same naive audience who applauds abolishing corporations.

I give it 3 stars instead of 1, because it's filmed well, and it's trying to have a plot.

Except that plot revolves around a codependent, isolated, angsty Peeping Tom with no understanding of history, politics or math.
