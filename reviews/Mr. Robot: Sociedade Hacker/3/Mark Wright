I was told to watch this due to it being quite quirky and dark, even the reviews (8.5 a while ago) built this up to be something amazing.

First episode in and yes it' quirky and yes it could be quite dark, however the character Mr. Robot played by Christian Slater was OBVIOUS from the very start that he was not real and just a manifestation of his own mind, which I found quite annoying.

As the series progressed the slow paced story was very grinding. I like a slow burner as they can really pull the viewer in to the world, but this is just poorly paced in almost every scene.

This combined with the fact that almost EVERY scene and filming technique has been stolen from so many different films is depressing. The story is about bringing down the financial institutions to reset everything to zero - sound familiar? The main character has a friend manifested from his own imagination - sounding more familiar? - The main character narrates through the series about the story and his own personal thoughts - yes you've guessed it - Fight Club in a series!

It is filmed in dark lighting with bleak colours almost verging on a pale sepia, just as Fight Club was. It also pulls from Existenz, 24 and The Matrix to name but a few.

It's difficult to understand why something so unoriginal and poorly paced can have such a good rating. Maybe Hollywood and the public are looking for a hero in the proliferation of badly scripted and poorly produced series on the TV just now.
