I tried to stick with this past the ludicrous casting (female "characters" in particular) but I've had to throw the towel in just recently.

I'm a software developer of some years myself and even I can't follow what the plot here is supposed to be - there appears to be basically no narrative arc or anything else to hold my interest at all.

What really throws this though is the utterly ludicrous female characters - these are supposed to be heavy techies or FBI agents etc and none of them look like they've eaten a solid meal in six months!

Add in the equally comical "United Nations" casting of the original hacking group members and I, literally, held my hand to my mouth to stifle my laughter at times ... I didn't spot a left-handed, one- legged scuba diving transsexual in that group but there must have been one somewhere!

If there are any female "hackers" out there in the real world, I can promise you they're going to be a size 16 instead of a size 0!

Quite how anyone involved with this production could think that wheeling out one skull-faced girl after another, in what's supposed to be an underground and highly skilled environment, was appropriate or believable in any way, shape or form I do not know.

If these girls were playing junkies then OK, I get it - emaciation etc is right on the money but otherwise, what the hell is wrong with them??

Sorry to see Christian Slater cameoing in this by the way - he deserves better but I can't blame him for the writing or the casting.

Dreadful.
