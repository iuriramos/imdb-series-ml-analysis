I really wanted to enjoy this show. The concept was intriguing.

But after finishing off this last season, I do not care for a new season.

Take away all of the distracting effects, the blurring, the blinking, the flashing, the fat transitions, and you have very little left except a slight story of Snowden and a lot of sex scenes that try to push the extremes of what most people are comfortable with. Typical Hollywood junk, in the end. It is another show written by very immature "kids" who think they are smarter than thou, and who think pushing their own memes and propaganda on you is "cool." 

Why create a really good story when you can feed think propaganda to the masses?

Yes, all we need is another show glorifying Obama. Pictures of him everywhere, clips and other dumb stuff. Who cares. Oh, and don't forget, Corporations are evil. Yeah, same old leftie crap.

No story in the end. Hacking. Yeah, that it's it. A hacker who is mental.
