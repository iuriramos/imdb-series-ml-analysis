The other day I was wishing there was a movie or TV show that had computers, hacking, etc. and BANG i find Mr Robot. I read the description and I'm thinking holy moly here it is!!! Perfect right? WRONG!! So Wrong. I was so excited that i bought the first 4 episodes. Thank god thats all I bought. Wow, what a train wreck. This had so much potential. First off, it has nothing to do with hacking, etc. alls it is so far is some kid, who i could care less of, going through morphine withdrawals. If i want to see someone going through withdrawals i can just look in the mirror. Christian Slater isn't that good in it either (and I'm a fan of his). CRAP CRAP CRAP. this really sux for me b/c i really wanted this to be good. FML. Side note: the acting by everyone is extremely sub par. Real talk.
