I have not seen more than 2 episodes, and I doubt I will waste my time on more. The show only makes sense if what we see are the wishful daydreaming of a young Asperger suffering geek. His fantasies are that young beautiful women are chasing after him to the point where he has to fend them of. Mega corporations try to headhunt him and offer million dollar positions in management. A secret "anonymous" type organisation try to recruit him for his superior hacking skills. And in his spare time he is an internet vigilante. So, basically the author of the series exploits young computer nerds who lack social skills, lack girls, lack authority over others, lack self esteem, lack purpose in life etc and fulfill their dreams in a TV show. And, it works. This is rated 9.2 when I write and the show really is not very good, not clever, it has nothing special at all. Except for the fact that it addresses a neglected audience of losers who want to see their fantasies become reality. A little like porn I guess. And had the writer mixed in more naked women, nerds are addicted to porn, I am confident the ratings would be even higher and maybe some school yard bullies getting beaten up. It is not super bad, I just don't see how this can appeal to others than the narrow target audience.
