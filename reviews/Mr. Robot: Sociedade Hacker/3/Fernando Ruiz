Some of us know what you're trying to do, show. We know you're just a high production-value show with arrogant artsy cinematography.

They portray the perfect hero for today's young adults, he has social anxiety, doesn't care for money, is a junkie, has sex, meets the other dystopian heroes in a cool abandoned arcade, hates people but at the same is white knighting the good fight against big bad evil capitalism... in other words, a SJW.

I think they hired people who understand how these TV shows work, so everything is meant to be appealing, from the plot and characters to the camera shots and flashbacks, but nothing is original, it's just a trendy device with no real identity to make people think "this show looks good, like those other shows and films".

The same crappy devices used to make "Life of Pi".

Oh and... when they were mocking that over-the-top hacking movie to try and make them look like ~real hackers~ in contrast... oh man, that was pathetic and laughable.
