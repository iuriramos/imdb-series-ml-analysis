Like many others I started watching this show because of all the good reviews I had read. That and I have carried a massive girl crush for Christian Slater since the 90's.

And also like so many others here I enjoyed the pilot, I thought it was unique, interesting and full of potential. And then the train plummeted off a cliff at a frightening speed.

The main character went from being someone you felt for, like a small, lost child that needed your protection to a degenerate drug addict. His delusions went from quirky and thoughtful to manic & nonsensical. And this lack of relatability for the main character creates a real problem in that all the other characters (and there's far too many to keep anything straight) are completely unlikeable and in some cases downright depraved.

Bottom line, I feel like I have to take a shower then view videos of kittens on YouTube after watching this.
