When I watched the pilot I was excited. This show seemed very promising; a big eyed hacker hidden in a hoodie with a strange nervous tic confronted a person with his dubious behavior on the internet, while in the meantime showing the viewer how good of a hacker he is himself. It was slick, savvy, convincing, like a lone cowboy on the vast plains of the internet, riding his laptop whilst shooting firewalls to pieces.

Already in the second episode I was getting a bit frustrated about the direction it was taking and this got worse as the show dragged on. Instead of focusing on what I thought was going to be the plot in the pilot (a hackers group similar to Anonymous taking on the big corporations), the plot focused on the hacker's personal problems, addictions and his love life. This could've been OK sub-stories, but as the main plot it couldn't hold it together at all.

Result: missed chance on what could've been a great show.
