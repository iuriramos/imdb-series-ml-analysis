I watched this series with great interest initially. It started off in episodes 1 and 2 with a good storyline, good acting and an interesting subject.

However, once episode 3 and beyond hit it's a different matter. The thinly veiled propaganda is hidden behind a storyline of drug abuse of the main character and various 'dream' sequences.

Out went the intelligent dialogue and in came a motive. Not of the characters but a motive of the writers and directors. It's to sell their view of the world and the 'evils of capitalism'.

I may not agree with everything capitalism does but I don't need a political doctrine force fed to me hiding within a series which has lost its edge.

oh, sorry, I forgot... it's all because he is tripping.
