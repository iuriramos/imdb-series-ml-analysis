I understand the demographic this is aimed at. Slacker boys, children despite being in their 20's, who are in debt up to their eyeballs and want to blame somebody else for their poor choices.

Certainly, I am troubled that so much of the world's wealth is in the hands of so few people. Certainly, I understand how impossible it is to make a dent in the plutocracy. So you think I might like this Â– but I don't. I have no debt, for I don't spend money on stupid stuff that is advertised to me--nor indeed expose myself to ads. I watched this DVD via my public library. I'm sure the intended audience downloaded each episode for 2.99 or pays 300 bucks a month for cable or satellite. Put it on the credit card, and boo-boo it's all somebody else's fault they can't pay it off. Well, spoiled little boys, bite me. If you want to disengage from the Evil Co.s of the world, kill your TV, get a second job, pay off your debt, and quit watching this pandering nonsense to convince yourself you aren't responsible for your choices. Oh, and bite me.

Did the main actor actually take morphine on each day of filming? If not, he is doing a good job of portraying that. That's all I can say positive about this mess.
