How very disappointing... Boring, slow, uninspired. There's nothing left from the promising season 1. I believe I read somewhere online that after season 1's success the director was given full freedom on shooting season 2. The result shows he is incapable to perform without having someone to control and micromanage him. There's no story telling any more and the characters turned blunt.Script and direction is of primary school graduates. This is now an overestimated TV series, which will be easily forgotten. It should have stopped being produced, at least there would be a sweet memory left of a promising TV series. Not going to waste my time watching it any more and as another reviewer mentioned previously "I am jumping off this train" too.
