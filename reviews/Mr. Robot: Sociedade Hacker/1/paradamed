I had enough of this show. A huge promise that ended up like a big disappointment.

The show ended for me when the mister rational guy killed that woman for no reason at all. I mean, the guy had a rational method even to get rid of his frustrations (paying the beggar to get hit) and then all of a sudden makes a stupid move like that with no actual motivation and worse, the husband knew he had harassed his wife in the night before the murder, not to mention his DNA and prints were all over the lady. I also hated the evil queen stereotype of his wife. Also, what is the point of Ellyot right now?

So this is it. Lots of stereotypes like the evil queen, the crazy hero and so on. Very little consistency on developing characters.

The writers are pretty much lost and it seems to me the show is written on the go with no cohesion and no planning at all.

Avoid it at all costs.
