This show is trying to mimic Fight Club and Dexter obviously, but the plot is so predictable and awful. 

It is full of clich√©, and it tried to mix Marxism/populism with the geek culture (what a terrible combination!), in a very shallow, brainless way.

It is clear that the target audience of this show is those who thought that drug addict can be controlled and their debt should be just cleared.

============================================= Watching it is really a waste of time.
