Season 1 of this show was great. I am not sure what happened in season 2 but the show is not worth watching; a total waste of recording space on the DVR. It's a hot mess and, but for the residual merit of season 1, I'd say it must be canceled. The show is so bad and so confounded that the series now appears to include additional airings of cast, writers, whomever, just trying to explain each episode and, I presume, -thereby retain some viewers. Well, I have no interest in a show that requires absurd levels of explanation to make any sense. The plot is broken and, despite the fast paced, let's call it twitchy presentation of each episode, the story line move at a snails pace. All the nauseating repetition of a daytime soap yet completely lacking in any wit or such other potentially redeeming quality. It the writers were shooting for schizoid embolism, then they scored a bulls eye.
