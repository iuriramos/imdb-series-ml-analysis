When I read synopsis/plot/reviews and saw such a high rating, I believed and wanted this series to "wow"me. Well at least be interesting enough to watch. Well, I was very disappointed. I did what the entire lengthy pilot. I gave it a chance even though it didn't feel right from the get go. It's like it was created by no talent hacks on a whim. It has every clich√© in the book and is painfully predictable. I watched the second episode and it went from bad to horrible. BTW, this is my genre and it is a relevant topic of today's society, but it's very poorly written and very poorly acted. Even with Christian Slater in it. I know that my review means nothing, because there are obviously thousands of IMDb users that loved it. I just had to say my piece.
