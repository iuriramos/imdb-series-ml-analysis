This TV series is great for people who are phenomenally stupid. To them, it offers deep, profound insights into the workings of our society. For example, did you know that our so- called freedom of choice is nothing more than the freedom to choose between Coke or Pepsi? Yes, that's the kind of a life-changing insight you'll be able to enjoy if you watch this show.

I knew that the show is going to be a pile of crap the moment they showed the main protagonist, a youngish hacker, burn a bunch of CDs using his computer. Who today burns CDs anymore? Obvious technology-based drivel written by people who don't know the first thing about technology.

Warning: don't watch if you're allergic to awful acting. Probably the worst acting seen on TV thus far.
