The very beginning of the very first episode will already make it very obvious, what this show it all about. (Not that the rest would at any point start contradicting that.)

It pretends to be a show about a "hacker" (a term that anyone who actually does such stuff would never ever use to describe it[1])  acting and thinking like a AOL user (who prints out his e-mail) or a iPhone-wielding media industry hipster believes such fictional people to act.

But in reality, it's about depicting anyone who's even aware of those who rule from 'behind' the scenes as a "crazy conspiracy theorist" with "mental problems" like Edward Snowden never happened.  Like Kappa Beta Phi [2] doesn't exist.  Like it's still 2012 and we're all blind believers. A well-known technique of discreditation that was documented[3] in the presentations released by Snowden, and well-known for a long time before that[4].

It's very obvious whose interests are pushed here. Especially with the second season being ordered before the first had even aired.

I'd absolutely not be surprised, if the budget for this production and the positive "reviews" came straight out of the Operation Earnest Voice [5] budget. But I'm sorry mates. Post-Snowden this doesn't work any more.

At least it's not yet another show glorifying mass-murder, torture and terror byhe military and the police, like half the other shows released in the USA today.
