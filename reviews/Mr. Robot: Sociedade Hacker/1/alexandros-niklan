as usual in series, season 2 fails to meet expectations

- Hacker is addicted to drugs and psychotic. - evil corps and security services are always working to conquer the world. - no real action than just a boring and slow process of character development to present ... really what are they trying to present? What is the set of questions that are brought for thinking here? Hackers trying to take over the world while some others try to do the same with other means?

Too bad.. first season was indeed something that was working viewers interest and scaled up reactions to a dramatic end. This season we still have not seen a scenario/plot forming up rather than a presentation of each person's story.
