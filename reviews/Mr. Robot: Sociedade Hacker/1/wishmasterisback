I started watching this show due to the high rating on IMDb. After the 1st episode I was thinking they finally did a great show that will have huge success. But shortly after the 2nd episode the show went very quick from great to worst you can imagine. From a skillful hacker movie to a sloppy soap telenovela.

It became off topic comparing to the 1st episode. 

For example if you are a fan of hacker movies consider watching Whoami - No System is Safe. It's a German film from 2014 who will not disappoint you.

I don't think Mr. Robot can be fixed after going so far in the wrong direction. Too bad.
