Mr. Robot is a mix of Marxism and nihilism. The characters are dumb, envious, self-destructive and anti-social. Rich people are depicted as psychopaths (literally all of them) whose only purpose in life is to kill, pillage and rape. Corporations are evil and must be destroyed. And computer programmers are a bunch of sjw-tumblr types. They are irrational drug-addicts who can't be bothered to conform to social norms, but have magically acquired super-human knowledge about anything technology related. All that is missing is an appearance from Bernie Sanders. Unfortunately the writers have chosen message over content. Every episode so far has been a disappointment. From the technical perspective the show is pathetically inaccurate, but this is the last of its problems. For people who are interested in dramas in the technology world, I recommend "Halt and catch fire". It's one hundred times better.
