Having watched the first episode hopes were high to have found a new favorite TV series to watch. Sadly the second episode went faster to a 0 than the Greek credit rating.

From needless and non-credible dialog to an action deprived boring slur life of a junkie this series has quickly waned my interest. Where the pilot episode left me wanting more with real moral choices and illegal yet so right action, the second episode was just and endless chain of boredom.

Hopefully the show will make either a turn to the light or the dark side of the various choices that lay ahead, otherwise I see no reason to keep watching.
