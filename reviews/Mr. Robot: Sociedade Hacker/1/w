I have watched 3 episodes now and the more i watch the more vile and empty feel. The lead character is meaningless. This is no tale of robin hood he and the main characters are a reflection of our debauchery and self obsession of the disempowered and alone, they are no different than the so called evilcorp they battle against. I hope this doesn't go any further as a series as it deepens the well of our suffering. We all want to kick it against the man but this series makes us as bad as them for right or for wrong.I can hardly tell a word he says and the only relief in all this emptiness is angela. I will watch one more episode to see what happens next and then stop. The worst series since Caprica.
