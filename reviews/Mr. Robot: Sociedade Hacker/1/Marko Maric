Honestly, it was clear to me extremely fast what this show is all about. Story is so subtle that it feels like it was made in Soviet union 30 years ago to check how Americans are "breathing". Corporations are "evil", money is root of all bad things that happen, poor are poor because someone is exploiting them, profit has none other purpose than to destroy honest people, being indebted to someone is creditor's fault, redistribution is the key to everything. When I look at comments below, I am honestly scared. Your government is now of gigantic proportions, they are telling you who to hire, who to fire, what can you say and what you can't, what can you own, how much, and what you can't. Once free country is now 42% owned by the government (% of government spending as part of total GDP). Way is clear for USA, left, left and more left. I have a bad feeling you are knocking on the wrong door when it comes to search for the root of your problems. Remember that Americans never experienced alternative to everything that is perceived as "bad" in this show. Some of us did and I'm urging you to reconsider. You have no idea where this road you are taking will lead you...
