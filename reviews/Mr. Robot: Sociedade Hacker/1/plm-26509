Encouraged by the promos featuring Slater, we recorded 3 episodes before watching the pilot. Half-way through it we deleted all episodes. Who really want to watch a psycho hoodie aimlessly wander through the show, not us.

The messages are clear that businesses are evil and are out-to-get all of us. Only a forthright honest savior such as Mr. Robot can save us from doomsday. If that is the case, then all is lost, Pointless show.

BTW, what ever happen to Christian Slater? At first we thought the hoodie was a secondary character or one going to blow up something. What a disappointment.
