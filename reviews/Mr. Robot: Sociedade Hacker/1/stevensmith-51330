Slow, plodding, none of the characters are likable or someone you can relate to.

It tries to hard to be clever, and as a result just waste time not developing the story or the characters. Tried several times to get into it and every time I gave up because nothing happens.

The premise of the show was excellent, the execution poor, spends too much time focusing on mute points and not enough happens.

Also found that the majority of good things seem to be taken from other shows, e.g. researching and setting people up ala Dexter or keeping hard disk copies of his work again ala Dexter.

Not sure how this show can have 8.9 in ratings as its one of those that's so boring you start questioning why your wasting your life watching this!
