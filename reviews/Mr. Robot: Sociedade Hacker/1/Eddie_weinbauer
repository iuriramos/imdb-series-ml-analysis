A guy who look like a cross between Beavis & Butt-Head and a deer in headlight.Which is also he's only expression too. Yup,you're right.We're talking about the weird looking sidekick guy, from the war at home. Someone made a bizarre matrix plot which makes no sense,and dropped him and Christian slater in it as the two leads,and thought it was a good idea.

I really wish I could tell you what the series is about,but I really have no idea.

I watched the first episode =60 min but understood very little.It had something to do with hacking and financial gain I think.
