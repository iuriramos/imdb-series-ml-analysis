OK, so I work in security, protect networks and servers - maybe that is why I liked the first episode a lot. Damn I was looking forward to the continuation.

But then 2'nd episode started slow, ended slow.

From episode 3 - all have been lost and from 4 onward, just awful, violence, drop, no real focus. No red line, awful dialog, no red line, dark dysfunctional setting, dark really annoying "music" tracks to make up for lacking dialog.

The people who apparently want to "save" the people who are not the 1% of the 1% of the 1% are social hackers, but I see no real technical skills.

If it hard continued in the track from 1'st episode I would gladly had give a 7.
