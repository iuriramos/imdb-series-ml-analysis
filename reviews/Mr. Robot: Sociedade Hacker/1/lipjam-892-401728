Writers should be sacked or at least taken off the Ritalin. I watched up to episode 3 of season 2. When Elliot start slagging off God and religion (how enlightened for the seventeenth century). I mean is there any other clich√©d "I'm so clever I read Voltaire" BS you want to vomit on your audience?

Stop trying to be clever, because you're not, and start entertaining, which you're not. If I want to hear pretentious "know it alls" spouting what they think they know then I can just venture down to my local wine bar or go on Google+ forums. 

If I want to be entertained with a good story then I watch a TV program. Remember who you are and forget what you think you know and get on with what your supposed to be doing: entertaining people, not alienating them with your opinions. I don't care what Elliot believes or thinks. I am not interested in his world view. I want a good conspiracy story-line, not a naval gazing session of his personal demons. It's boring and of no story telling value. He's a hacker and a nut case we all get that. Now move on with the story. Understand what you should be doing and start doing it or else you will loose your audience.
