For some reason Media has always had it for science and technology, regardless the fact that they rely on it on every stupid thing they produce, just like the rest of the religious community take on the same subjects. On almost every episode, tech savvy audience find it difficult to stomach the amount of rubbish being displayed as computer stuff.

This is so awful it makes you sick, unless of course you are a technophobe or someone with no understanding of technology what so ever, then it may see like something to watch and fill time with. To avoid spoilers here are some pointers you may want to check: first of all computer hackers don't wear hoodies to avoid being spotted, that is simply lame and patronising beyond anything I have come across. 

Second, Tor browsing wouldn't allow another hacker to see the stuff you are checking on the internet unless you are using it wrong. there are so many similar errors that it is hard to say they were unintentional. 

In addition the way hackers are wrongly portrayed as psychologically unstable persons, though they are or think they are much smarter than other people. As well as the idea that hackers waste their time hacking individuals to gain knowledge of their histories and habits is so lame.

I have no issues with Sci-Fi series or movies, to the contrary I love them, but when they attack the basics of science and technology I stand back and point out the misconceptions they are trying to sell.
