Watching this show is a lot like eating a beef and bean burrito from 7-Eleven at 1am. The first few bites were delicious, but before you know it you're on the toilet punching through 6 inches of porcelain.

Mr robot episode one was surprisingly good and lived up to all the hype that this crappy show has somehow garnered... in a way it kind of felt like Dexter in a modern, nerdy way. Everything after that first episode could be wiped with and flushed down a toilet. The show suffers from several problems. First, the main character is incredibly annoying and makes me want to punch myself in the face. Christian Slater (though great in True Romance) has similar effects. His acting is about as good as Rob Schneider and his character's persona (and accent) becomes increasingly challenging to take seriously. Next, the plot line is completely illogical and must have been scrapped together by a bunch of unemployed, heroine-addicted writers who thought this was a good idea at the time. Nothing in this show is realistic despite the fact that this show constantly strives to be 'technically accurate'. It's not. As if the show wasn't already intolerant enough, you can't go more than ten minutes without having some anti-corporation, anti-republican party, pro- liberal horse manure rammed down your throat. 

Despite the high ratings this show somehow received, it is crap.
