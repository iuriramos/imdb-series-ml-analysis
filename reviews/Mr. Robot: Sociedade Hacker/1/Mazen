This is a slow and boring TV show where the acting drags on and on and to be honest, Rami Malek is completely the wrong guy to be cast as the main character. He's not acting material and he is boring, has an irritating voice and appearance. The first episode could have been shown in 10 minutes and the show is really painful to watch. Very surprised it has a high rating but that's probably because dumb people like the idea of an ANONYMOUS type group trying to bring down corporate America. (for example - the mask used and how E Corp appears to be controlling everything). This series is riding on a wave and in time time, people will see this show for what it is - RUBBISH. At the moment, with all this Snowden, NSA and Assange thing in the news, people will be drawn to this but when you look at the episodes as a whole, absolutely nothing is being presented except boring bits of filming interleaved in boring bits of film where the writer thinks it's interesting to build up information about characters' lives. For example, when Mr Robot asks Elliot to tell him how his father died... I mean, who cares.....????
