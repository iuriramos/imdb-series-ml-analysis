So far the show appears to be a poor rip off of the movie Fight Club. The main character with his schizophrenic personality creates an alter ego, totally imaginary, Mr Robot and then the 2 personalities struggle to destroy the credit companies. Good acting, poor writing with annoying characters - even the imaginary ones. The show seems to get interesting and then in comes an imaginary character that lives only in the mind of Elliot and the chow bogs down and gets boring very quickly. Christian Slater must have been desperate for work to accept this role. I recommend seeing Fight Club so you can see how this clever idea works when it is done well unlike this TV show.
