I forced myself to watch the first 2 episodes and I wished I hadn't. There is really nothing to like about this TV show. It has no substance whatsoever. Un-interesting characters, un-realistic dialogs and situations.

If you are some far left teenager who's living in your mom's basement and believe in the backward mentality that corporations are the source of all evil in the world, and that it's cool to "take down the system" using cyber terror attacks, maybe you can find something to like about this show, otherwise I would suggest to steer away from this. Ironically is sponsored by Amazon, one of the most consumer friendly corporations in the world. 

To add insult to injury it's filled with IT gibberish that is far beyond the average viewer knowledge on computers and it's just there to trick the viewer that this is somehow an intelligent show. How deceptive. Some technical terms here and there are fine but not like this in the driving seat. 

This show tries to be smart but it's dumb, tries to be modern but it's outdated. A failure on all fronts. Watch at your own peril, you will regret doing it.
