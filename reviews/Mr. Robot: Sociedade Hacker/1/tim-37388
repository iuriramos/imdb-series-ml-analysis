Leave it to American TV producers to produce evil and stupid crap. The first two episodes were worth watching but the frequent cigarette product placement made the show suspect and the violence in episode 2 set the tone for descent into rubbish in episode 3.

The technical aspects of the computers and hacking were substantially better than most TV shows but somewhat lacking in realism. 

The show started off with some likable and sympathetic characters, but the production quality and acting are marginal by many of the actors. 

Rami Malek does a good job as Elliot but shows inconsistent directing. Portia Doubleday could do better in the role of Angela.
