I like the main character, remembered him from Night at the Museum. I was digging this show. I like gritty/dark. It was a little over the top and the hacking/security seemed a little hokey, but it is entertainment, you can forgive some of the details (a little) if it's entertaining. However, when they got to the whole redistribution thing and everyone is unfairly in debt... Nope, I'd seen enough.

I put myself through college, so I have no sympathy for folks with high student loan debt. No one put a gun to their head and said you have to go to college and you have to go into massive debt to go to college. This show sends an incorrect/naive message.

I should not have to pay for someone else's poor choices.
