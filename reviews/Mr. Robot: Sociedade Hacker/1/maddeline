This was one of my worst experiences whatsoever, a total waste of time. The high scoring (8.8) is too much for this, way too much. This grading system is confusing me, I personally think it deserves a negative 8 - it was so badly thought out. Conversations - boring, characters - boring, plot - boring. I dislike it when they are trying to convince me in the originality of their ideas when, in fact, "Fight Club" already showed me a burned out man with a mental disorder fighting against "society" in an aggressive manner. What "Mr.Robot" couldn't portray (compared to "Fight Club") is the realism and the the anger that the characters felt. I see no structure in "Mr.Robot", I see modern trends like - social anxiety issues, anti-social behaviour (in a passive behind-a-monitor way), drug use (to make it more original, let's make the character take morphine through the nose, that's never shown in a TV-series before now, has it)and the spin off..oh, man, was it all a hallucination of a young troubled mind? I don't know, may be watch "Fight Club" and find out...
