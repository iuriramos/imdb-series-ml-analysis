The show is not good. Boring. No insight on hackers whatsoever.

The most annoying is heavy propaganda messaging. 

The propaganda messages are:

- drug use by young people is cool - smoking is cool - a drug addict can be a "genius hacker" - unprotected sex, random sex with multiple partners is cool (in reality, there is 100% probability you will get an STD. Note: you never see someone getting an STD in the Hollywood output) - women are raped regularly - muslims wearing headscarf are cool and are revolutionary hackers (in reality, covering head for women is never mentioned in Koran) - Swedish people and Europeans are evil perverts

Learn to spot the propaganda and avoid it. The slightly retarded, which is the new normal today, should not watch. For them it is a danger.
