A lot of people still think of the internet and hacking culture as some kind of mysterious and fascinating revolution. If you aspire to join the ranks of snooty faux geek wannabes then this show is for you. I tried to watch it twice. I thought maybe episode two would be less insulting? Please.

I was shocked, SHOCKED I tell you, when it was mentioned that the onion routing protocol was not as secure as previously thought. That means all the illegal onions I purchased on the "Dark Web" are now open to interrogation by the National Security Administration, and that just plain scares me.

It's time to change my Yahoo password and stop uploading my address book to social networking services. I am so frightened of what this show has made me aware of that I can barely sleep at night. I can't believe people are entertained by this scriptwriting drivel and ridiculous acting.
