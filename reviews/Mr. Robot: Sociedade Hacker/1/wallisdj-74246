What the heck did I just watch? Am I too psychologically messed up to be "living" inside the head of another psychopath? Any good story has to begin with a good beginning. The first five words of a novel. The first minute or two of a video.

There is no established purpose. No established reference point. The viewer is just left floating above a non-distinct landscape hoping (against hope, because it is not going to happen) that his feet will finally land somewhere.

The plot aimlessly bounces along between the pinball bumpers of nonsensical sequences. In short, this piece is a worthless fragment of someone's incomplete dream.

And, not only can I NOT follow along with the protagonist, I am supposed to care about what happens to him in the cliffhanger ending? I'm siding that the group he is confronted with eats him alive . . . and the series ended as well.

If this is the future of television entertainment, we are all in a very sorry state indeed.
