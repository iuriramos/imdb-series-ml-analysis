Pilot to this series and the following episode absolutely rank highly in my books, for what makes a great series.

Without a doubt I was hooked. Rami Malek makes a great protagonist and his character is extremely thematic for the time this was written. Its easy to get your bearing in Elliot's world as there are many slight details that the viewer relate to. As well as having a wonderful script and great character portrayal, the unpredictable cast does a good job of sticking everything together.

Unfortunately the plot twist in episode 8 really, really, I mean really screwed everything sideways and you end up with a WTF situation where nothing really feels right afterward. Like your just supposed to accept that bullshit from what was turning out to be a really great show.

The final nail in the coffin had to be the fact that a lot of the revolutionary context is derived from propagandist views about conglomerates and debt slavery, an old and obviously false argument used to disguise power in places where everyone is looking///

I would just like to say I am appalled that a plot line worthy of Breaking Bad standards was squandered in such a way. I hope other viewers will recognize this and help me fight against this unjust 9.0 rating set by idiots that rate after watching only the pilot episode.

Quit at episode 7 if your willing. Bon voyage.
