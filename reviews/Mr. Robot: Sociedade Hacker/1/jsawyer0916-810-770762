I looked forward to this show as I like dark, interesting stories. Dark it certainly is. Interesting, no.

I like others made it through the 3rd episode but quit watching after the explicit gay sex scene. Scenes like that contribute absolutely nothing to the story line but certainly promote an agenda. Add to that the pointless meandering boring plot and there's no reason to keep this show on the watch list.

The only useful thing about this show would be trying to decide which sociopathic character you hate the less. About as confusing as an episode of Lost!!! but at least Lost was captivating.
