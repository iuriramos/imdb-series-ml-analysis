Like most people have pointed out, the series starts off strong, but then t becomes complete garbage. The plot moves extremely slowly (some scenes and even shots going on for way too long), with many of the sub-plots dragged on unnecessarily long. And these sub-plots seem to have very little impact on the main storyline.

The writing seems childish. The main character's internal monologues are an attempt at sounding profound, but they end up sounding like the lyrics of a song from a teen emo band.

The characters are flat and boring. Just giving a character a tragic backstory doesn't make them interesting.The acting is rigid and inauthentic (with a few exceptions). And this was a pet peeve but the protagonist, who apparently has crippling anxiety and depression and lives in a crappy apartment, looks healthier and more in shape than most of the other characters. I know the main character has to look good for TV, but I just can't buy that.
