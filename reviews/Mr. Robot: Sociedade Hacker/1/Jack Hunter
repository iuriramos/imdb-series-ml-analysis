Main character is very unlikeable. He has weird bug eyes that would  make him look creepy even if his character was not already creepy by  design. Not a main role material. Random guess here is that he sucked  body parts and bent over for right gay guy in order to land this role.  Which obviously brings LGBT activists here like flies to give show a  10. Plus even in the pilot they force feed homosexuality to the viewer. 
I read some lunatics comparing this to Dexter. Just lol. This is a guy  who is going around abusing people who trust him. Only cowards like  Anonymous and average trolls who think they are fighting for social  justice can find such horrible behavior something to be admired. 
Tech is TV shows and films in general is nonsense. But in this one it  is exceptionally bad. I mean I watched Cyber recently, and that shows  hacking kinda sucked, but compared to this show its realistic. 
Two simple examples. 
At the beginning he claims to single handedly took control of TOR exit  nodes. Just to bust some kiddie porn server guy. Not actual abuser of  children, just guy hosting server with pics. Not even videos. Just  pics. Like, are they nuts? Government finds that hard to pull off. It  has been done, but it was organized effort by hundreds of hackers and  thousands of script kiddies helping them. Not ONE GUY. 
DDoS attacks happen very, very frequently. Yet in one scene we have  whole teams of two different corporations unable to stop it until mr  bug eyes comes to save the day. 
They should have brought in a real hacker to assist in writing script,  got better writer, got better lead (and, honestly, lead for show like  this, it works better as a young, pretty girl, like original (not US  remake) Girl with a Dragon Tattoo). 
To claim how this show is good as anything other than fairly obviously  LGBT/Social Justice/Liberal propaganda is just stupid. So I am giving  it a 1/10 because I detest crappy propaganda.
