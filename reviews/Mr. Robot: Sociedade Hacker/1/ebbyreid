**Spoiler Alert **

I really tried to like this. But after the end of the third episode I was done. I thought from the 8.8 rating that this show might be worth watching. Boy was I wrong. I'm so sick of almost every single TV show or movie that comes out that has to incorporate some kind of sick disgusting gay story line. Why? Every aspect of that in the show was very unnecessary. I had to fast forward through it. Yuck! Just yuck!! I wonder if writers or producers of whoever approves this crap really believes that everyone wants to see that. On top of that it got really really boring by the middle of the second episode. I didn't have high expectations for this show, but I was not expecting such a sh*t show. Unless you enjoy watching gays have butt intercourse (eeewwww) or you enjoy slow paced, boring, pointless shows with no direction, stay away from this. Don't waste your time. Even if you decide you're okay with that, I'm pretty sure most people will realize by the third episode that this show is garbage.
