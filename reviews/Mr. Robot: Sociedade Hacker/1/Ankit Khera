This is the worst series i have ever seen in my life. Writers have no clue about what they want to achieve. Direction sucks so bad that you do not feel connected to the show in even the most important scenes. The actors and the basic characterization are so bad that you just want to kill them. The main actor is so bad that you just want to kill him. He does not have a clue about the plan that he is working on. His sister's and crush's character are so irritating that you cannot watch them for a minute without yawning. The masterminds look like clowns. There is not even a single scene in the whole show which i remember even though i have watched it 3 hours earlier. Save yourself from depression by not watching this.
