I know many may have a different opinion but this is one of the best shows i have seen in a while . And i definitely recommend for you to see it regardless of what you like to see . The main reason i would say this is because it has the thrill and adventure as well reality in it so if you like to see superhero stuff or reality shows or any other shows it blends to it . A point to note is it is different from our regular show which makes it stand out of all the other shows out there . But i will give it a 10/10 for the first season AND i hope the make it more better as the characters develop and so should the plot . I know this is not like a review but my god i just had to comment on this show.
