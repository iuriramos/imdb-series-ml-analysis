This series will be more meaningful and captivating than the Matrix trilogies. The Mr Robot scripts show incredible perceptions and understanding of today's world ,how it works and what is needed to fix it. By comparison the Matrix was too futuristic and lost some dynamic mental impacting in the process. This series is the tip of the teeth of the cutting edge consciousness of the newly awakening masses. It depicts a new growing humanity with real practical workable ethics and values empowered through high tech activism. Nothing motivating like this has been seen since the JFK speeches and Peace Corps of the 60s. The new hippies are super intelligent, dress well and are armed with high tech weaponry aimed at changing the incredible plight of the oppressed working and non working masses. The series carries off this world shaking theme with incredible sensitivity and spectacular perceptions. It has something for everyone. Challenging mentally, socially interacting and entertaining with moments of great impacting drama and significance.
