Malek's Elliot is a Cyber security specialist by day, laboring away for a cubicle-filled corporation. By night, though, he's an unrepentant hacker 혰 delving into the personal lives of those who enter his orbit 혰 as well as a drug user and someone so painfully awkward that he freely admits, "I don't know how to talk to people."He is lonely,he is sad but that's not all.

Diving into the plot, Elliot is introduced on the subway, his frantic narration imparting that he has stumbled onto "a conspiracy bigger than all of us," involving masters of the universe who will essentially stop at nothing to achieve their objectives(referring to E-corp also). If that sounds more than a little paranoid 혰 and much of "Mr. Robot" does 혰 Elliot is assured this is all too real by a renegade hacker (Christian Slater, marking TV's best use of him in some time), who goes by the name Mr. Robot, and wants to recruit him to infiltrate and undermine the shadowy corporation(E-corp) Elliot has been hired to protect.

At last i must say this has been a magnificent production by USA Network and has raised much eyebrows with tremendous drama, suspense and some unexpected climax.
