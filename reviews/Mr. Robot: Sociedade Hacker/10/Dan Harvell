Charmingly claustrophobic and delightfully disjointed, "Mr. Robot" does a fantastic job when it comes to placing the viewer in the mindset of the show's characters. With their enemies closing in on every side and not knowing just who they can and cannot trust, it is only fair that we viewers feel that closed-in sensation that they are, without a doubt, experiencing. Following along with Elliot's social and mental disorders gives us the same dizzying disconnect that he must be feeling. All of this, masterfully written. It is almost as if the nervous energy and confusion are the paints with which the masterpiece is created on the dystopian canvas the show creates.

Along with the brilliant writing and acting comes the treat of the show handling computer "hacking" in a way that is the most realistic depiction offered by today's television and movies. The hacks are not illustrated with three-dimensional directory structures that explode with gibberish once the hack is complete. The hacks are actually done within a Linux shell environment (Kali Linux, specifically... one of the best Linux-based cyber security distributions out there). They are illustrated in a way that is tech savvy enough to satisfy my inner nerd, while being general enough to not confuse the technically uninitiated.

If you are looking for a thrilling show that is full of twists, turns, and jaw dropping reveals, "Mr. Robot" is definitely for you. I warn you, however, to pay close attention to EVERYTHING. If you miss a detail, chances are you missed a lot, which can lead to the bad kind of confusion. But, if you pay attention, even the most confusing aspects of the show are explained in full in a manner most satisfying.
