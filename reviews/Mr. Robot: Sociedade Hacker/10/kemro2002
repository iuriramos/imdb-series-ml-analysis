I decided to give it a 10 from the very start cause after a long, long while I spent an hour of my life on a pilot that made me feel that there might yet be something new under the sun. I really enjoyed the story, which was quite tense but yet utterly believable. There is so much to explore and dig deep into the story and keep the tension of the viewers, without crossing the border of TV-realism plausibility.

The casting is great. Rami Malek (whom to be honest I have not heard of before, although he seems familiar) is a great choice for the main role. Enough troubled looking and thank God he is not blond, if you know what I mean.

We are face to face with some not so radical ideas anymore about what our world has actually become, and my only fear, for now, is that the plot might turn into: 'Corporations are actually not that bad. Please come and work for us Elliot, you are great'. if it comes to that, it will be such a sad, sad loss of potentially amazing series. 

We all see, especially on mainstream TV, a dark and realistic depiction of corporations that is often followed by a change of heart and, 'Look, they are not actually that bad' type of story. Whatever the case will just wait and see what follows. 

Looking forward to the second episode, and I'll probably watch the pilot again!
