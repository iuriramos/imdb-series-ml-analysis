What a perfect view of the computer industry in the real modern world. The lead actor performs so well and mind-boggling that you get pulled into the story and forget everything around you. The beautiful soundtrack adds to the tension and mystery this show delivers. Great performance from especially Rami Malek and Portia Doubleday, the attraction between them does not interfere with the story-line and is not at all distracting but adds additional excitement to this great series. Since I am dutch it's hard for me to find the right words for this review of this fantastic new TV show but I hope you understand that this is simply new, innovative, very original, compelling and addictive. I can't wait for more... dutch robin
