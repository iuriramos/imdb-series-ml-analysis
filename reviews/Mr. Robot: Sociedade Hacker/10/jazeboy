This is my first review. I have to review this show it's that good. 

A cross between Inside job, fight club and requiem for a dream. I love this show so much I've started watching it through for a second screening after only a weeks break. I work in IT, I'm not a coder, but it's realistic enough to hook me in to its storyline. Very Addictive and with a touch of occupy Wall Street too thrown in.

I love this show. I give it 10/10 on my second viewing. It's not absolutely perfect but it's so close that I have to give it a 10. I can't wait for more of Mr Robot. The only problem is waiting for more. Hurry up please.
