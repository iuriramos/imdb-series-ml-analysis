Absolutely Amazing, specially for people who like science, computer/hacking stuff and psychological TV shows/movies. I have no complaints for this show. the People out there giving bad reviews are people who are too sensitive about morality or sensitive about accuracy in terms of the plot of the story or technical terminologies about hacking or network engineering. To those people I say it's TV! it's for entertainment nothing else,stop taking things so seriously, you have youtube full of educational videos and documentaries for that. This show is like a weird combination of "The matrix" and "Dexter" but without so much science fiction and instead of killing people you got hacking.
