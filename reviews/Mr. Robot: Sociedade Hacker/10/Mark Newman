...No, it's better that Dexter. Why? NOBODY CRIES!

It's true. A bloody miracle. I watched the whole of the pilot episode and not one person burst into tears.

Now, this is an American TV program, so this obviously won't continue. I expect the floodgates to open maybe next week or by episode three. The Yanks can't help it. It's not proper TV unless some sappy idiot is crying.

I suppose it's a ploy to get the women interested in Sci-Fi. It won't work of course, but TV executives have the intelligence of a biscuit so they'll keep trying to push Sci-Fi onto women even though they absolutely hate it, don't understand it and just don't want it in the same room as they are in!

It's just like Dexter - Sociopathic outcast narrates us through the plot and keeps mementos of his 'conquests.'

If the quality of the pilot extends to the rest of the series it's going to be bloody fantastic. My hopes are low though... As much as I loved the pilot, I've learned not to get my hopes up.

If you liked 12 Monkeys then you'll hate this. Mr Robot makes sense!
