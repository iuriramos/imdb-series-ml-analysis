Only two shows have ever WOW'd me - True Detective Season 1, and Mr. Robot. Though entirely different subjects, Mr. Robot features the same intricacies and attention to detail that few series are able to touch on with great interest. Though many mention the performance of Christian Slater, it's my opinion that Rami Malek is the stand- out actor and character making this a stand-out series. His performance draws you into his ever-flawed person of a character. To play that kind of character without making a joke of it, or making it utterly cringe-worthy is something I do not count as easy. A special type of person is needed to play such a reserved, yet inner-tormented character without giving way to their own personal personality as a person (not an actor). You truly believe Rami is no one else but Elliot. He isn't Rami playing Elliot on screen, he is Elliot in this series. 

I cannot wait for the second season, as we delve deeper into the spiraling out of Elliot's mind as he encounters new challenges and unexpected events. I also am interested to see how the other characters develop as well, as they seem to be making progress of their own. What else is hiding that we don't know about? That Elliot doesn't know about?
