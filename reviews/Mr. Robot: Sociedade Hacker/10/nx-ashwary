While Famous cable network like HBO, AMC, FX and show time often find themselves shows which gets all the attraction from viewers. Now Universal Cable Productions has got a show that will get attention. Now the channel get to deliver a great crime drama, Mr. Robot. 

Created by Sam esmail, never heard of him since before this show came to light but i can really say he has taken TV industry to completely another level. Mr Robot is the first cyberpunk thriller series in the television history.

Starring Rami Malek, the series follows the journey of Elliot, a computer programmer working at a cyber security firm and playing the role of vigilante hacker. His life isn't normal when he interacts with living world around him due to anti social disorder.Elliott has symptoms of autism. He's brilliant, obsessive with computers and has no social skills But things start to change when he meets Mr. robot and joins his group (Fsociety).

*My Opinion*

After a disappointing year of 2015 for TV series. Sam brought this masterpiece show. When i watched it's pilot i hooked up with the show in no time. it was truly a jaw dropping episode for me. And you just can't blink yours eyes while this show is on. this show is taking social-media paranoia to the mainstream. After this series has shown the viewers hacking a social-media account isn't much hard for a guy like Elliot (Rami Malek). it might be offensive for few but this show is serving nothing but truth.

A show of it's time, Mandatory viewing for hackers or programmers or coders or developers or whatever. Don't just sit there go watch this show you dummy :D -peace-
