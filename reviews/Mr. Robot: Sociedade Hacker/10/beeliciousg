nothing is perfect. humans always get disappointed by the imperfection of something then they criticize or they turn their backs. including this show, it's not a perfect thing to watch or to enjoy so you'll might unlike the show or turn your back if you want to watch the show from the beginning. to me the show isn't perfect either but the story is excellent. thats the thing that kept me watching all episodes of season 1. sometimes i don't care about imperfection, so i give 10 for the ratings of this show because the story is excellent. 

i know there are many movies or shows that show people about hack (so it is mainstream already) but i've never seen any appropriate show or appropriate movie that appropriately shows me that hack can change our world our life, hack can be an act of heroism, hack can save humans and how dangerous it is for humans (including me). the main story of the show is to take down a big company by hack, a big company that has a very big influence on economy. we know that producers have to create many episodes for a TV show so you'll see other things on this TV show about psychological disorder, drugs, romance, relationships, the characters' life, works etc. 

the main actor is perfect for the main character of this show. he's not a beautiful man like the main actor of the flash (how could you think a hacker has got to be a beautiful person?) but he's so perfect for Mr Robot. he did a perfect job for the show.

the other reason i give ten is that there are so many quotes or speeches that touch me very much. f**k society.
