This show has to be one of the most amazing shows I have ever seen. Did not have much expectation however it is mind blowing. The acting, direction, cinematography, background score.. especially background score and the the style of storytelling is amazing. The way they have portrayed the technical aspects of the show feel very real as well. The show creators have added a lot of little details that are great of people who are tech savvy. However still kept it simple enough for audience that might not understand something extremely technical. 

I don't want to write much about the show as even little details can spoil it. Its better if you watch the show not knowing what to expect.
