Mr Robot is probably the best TV Show to hit television period! Finally a show with a solid story, based on real world possibilities, a show brought out to the world at a perfect time; and the cast is perfect! From the very first episode of Mr Robot it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's one of the first shows made on technology where they sort of spoke some truthful words within the computer world. Now of course some of the people in the show you could tell they didn't use smartphones in real life and they didn't fulfill their character as well but for the most part great job. Mr Robot's only flaw that I really got annoyed with was the computer language and communication. Being that I'm a programmer the terms used on standard computer conversation are nothing like in the show, especially every other word being FTP (File Transfer Protocol); but of course Hackers featuring Angelina Jolie took us through the computer world with cool images in a computer screensaver. For the most part of things happening within the TV Series Mr Robot it was pretty close to hitting the nail on the head, great stuff; great show. This is honestly one of the best shows to come out, and sadly I know that when something great comes out like this it gets damaged or pulled due to the "ooh squirrel" syndrome in this world. I hope this show keeps going, it's perfect!
