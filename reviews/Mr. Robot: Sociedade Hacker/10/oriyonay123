I want to say congratulations to Sam Esmail and anyone who has written this show. This is by far one of the best shows I've ever seen, and if it continues with this quality it will become my favorite drama (along with Breaking Bad, of course...) The tech talk doesn't make me want to punch something (which never happened before).. Usually, these shows make hacking look like a video game, this one doesn't. I've read the pilot and it's the best pilot I've read (http://www.zen134237.zen.co.uk/Mr_Robot_1x01_-_Pilot.pdf). Great job! Please keep this show coming. This could easily be the next Breaking Bad / Dexter. Wonderful job.

Congrats, this one's a keeper :)
