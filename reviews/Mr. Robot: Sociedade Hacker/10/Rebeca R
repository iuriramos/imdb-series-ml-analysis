By the time I was nearing the end of the pilot episode, I was cringing. This show is centered around the idea that corporations are bad, people are forcibly imprisoned by debt, and wealth redistribution is a must. Either people are crazy or the ratings are rigged, because there is no way that this series (currently at 9.4) deserves a rating higher than The Walking Dead (8.7), How I Met Your Mother (8.5), The Office (8.8), Wayward Pines (8.2), this show even got higher than Sherlock the 2010 TV series (9.3). Not only is the idea that this show is spreading so anti-capitalistic it makes me nauseous, but the acting was mediocre and the tech aspect unrealistic (nowhere near 9.4 quality). The main character also glorifies stalking, drug use, and teenage angst in a grown person (I hesitate to refer to him as a man).
