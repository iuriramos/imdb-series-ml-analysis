That's the kind of movie that makes you think. It's dark, smart and the dialogues are beautifully written. I can't believe that all the words written there are actually allowed by the system that controls society. Yes, it states clearly how things are, how we are controlled by the corporations and its governments. I decided to write this review to ask the directors, producers and writers why they decided to write one single scene in the whole series that's completely stupid! Burning US dollars as some sort of protest? People, don't you know that money is actually just a check? And what happens if you burn a check? You are actually giving the value of that check back to the account owner!! If you burn a 100 dollars bill, you are giving that amount back to the government! I remember a scene from Batman where the joker as a form of rebellion burns millions of dollars! Well, that's Batman and Batman is not a movie that's supposed to be smart! But Mr. Robot is very smart! How could they made the same silly mistake? You want to protest? Throw those dollars back into the market and help to create inflation! Anyway, apart from that stupid scene, the rest of the entire series is extremely elegant and smart! I hope they don't change a bit the philosophy of the show!
