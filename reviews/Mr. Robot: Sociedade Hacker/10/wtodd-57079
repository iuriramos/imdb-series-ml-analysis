If you like hacking, drug taking, crazy (true) story lines, Christian Slater and a mental journey of a hackmeister then you will love this show. It starts off slowish but then works up into a frenzy pretty quickly and roller coasters along quite nicely. This is how shows should be made and reminds me of the show fringe a little bit but more aggressive, less science based, less sci-fi and a whole lot more grimy and i eagerly await the download when it arrives each week and by the looks of it has 2 seasons planned from the offset so its fun times ahead for this robot lover. The acting is superb and the casting is spot on so far lets just hope they don't walking dead it and turn it into a "soap opera" like they did with that one.
