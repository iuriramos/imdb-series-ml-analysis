Like taking The Fight Club, and making a (relevant, and technologically current) series about it. And I love The Fight Club. 

Honestly, this has to be one of the best TV series I've ever seen. For one, I can relate to Elliot a lot, as a character, which makes the whole plot feel even closer and more present to my reality. Also, the way the topic of the series is portrayed, both pointing out issues and mocking the criticism itself, reflects a huge part of our everyday lives in a way that is usually ignored in cinema.

Overall, great use of technology (not oversimplified like in 99% of all films related to hacking) and character development. 

All I hope is for it to stay the way it is, in terms of quality. Well done!
