This show is probably one of the most interesting things I've seen on TV in quite some time. I'm actually a big fan of just about everyone in it. Rami has been in a few previous productions that I've seen like Need for Speed, Short Term 12, Ain't Them Bodies Saints (pretty sure he was even in an episode of Gilmore Girls once?), etc.. Christian Slater obviously has deep roots all the way back to Heathers and beyond. Carly Chaikin has evolved so much from her part on Suburgatory. Portia Doubleday is the exact opposite as her character from the Carrie reboot. Not to mention the man who plays Giddeon was a cast member from House of Cards. But on top of that, the opening episode really is as intriguing as they say. And in it, they even address some issues during Elliots inner monologue at the therapist's office that, until recently weren't exactly publicly discussed except on late night liberal talk shows (not that we don't all enjoy those, but it's nice to see these recent events really get some exposure). Also, just the entire plot (and I'm speaking up unto the most recent episode, but I won't give anything away because I refuse to include spoilers in this review) is intriguing. It's just...one of those shows that doesn't necessarily need audience manipulation. It doesn't talk down to the audience. It doesn't make the audience choose right from wrong. It leaves everything open for speculation, even the things that seem to sit on the far ends of the moral spectrum. I love this show. I hope this show continues for a long time. I can honestly say that based on this season alone, I would want to see this story develop into as big of a full circle as it possibly can.
