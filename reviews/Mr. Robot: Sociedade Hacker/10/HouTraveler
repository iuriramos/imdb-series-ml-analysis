I love love love this series. The writing, the story lines and the acting are all excellent. Folks who are technology-oriented are especially likely to enjoy this show. I appreciate the smart writing and the plot twists and surprises. The characters are well-written and fully developed by creator and writer Sam Esmail. Rami Malek, relatively unknown before this series, excels at portraying the brooding and fascinating main character. Sometimes the psychological drama is very dark but it has a specific purpose and the viewer is rewarded in the end. I enjoy this series more than any I've seen in recent years and I can't wait for Season 2.
