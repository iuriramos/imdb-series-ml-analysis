The hype is real--this show is terrific. The characters are complex and engaging, the cinematography is groundbreaking, the writing is brilliant--USA Network really hit it out of the park with "Mr. Robot." The biggest critique of the series is that it's a blatant rip-off of "Fight Club" mixed in with "American Psycho." Ignore the noise. Is there truly any idea that hasn't been done before? (The correct answer is no).

See, the thing is, I tend to not be a fan of dramatic television. It's not to say that there aren't a lot of good drama programming out there, because that's definitely untrue (I loved "Daredevil" and "Jessica Jones.") But I work in entertainment and I find so many of the critically acclaimed dramas like House of Cards to not only be slow and excruciatingly boring, but also full of characters that I can't identify with. Don't get me wrong, "Mr. Robot" is a bit of a slow burn but the characters are so interesting that it doesn't matter.

In terms of the quality of each season (there's only two so far), season one is basically as good as TV gets. Every episode is gripping, and aside from a minor side story, and not one felt like a filler episode. As terrifying as the Wellicks are, they are my favorite characters on this show. Season two takes a bit of time to find it's footing but definitely goes out with a bang. It also has a different feel to the season as it focuses on an intense psychological journey with Elliot and Mr. Robot. And big season two bonus is that we find out just how perfect Joanna is for Tyrell.

If you have Amazon Prime and you aren't watching "Mr. Robot," get off IMDb immediately and start it!
