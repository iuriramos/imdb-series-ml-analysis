Elliot, played by Rami Malik, pulls of great show. What a great job by the writers and the Director , a fantastic series shedding limelight on the socio-economic problems plaguing the world

Finally this kind of information is made for mainstream audience. The series goes in details how messed up the world is . how unfair the capitalistic Market-based Debt slavery ,what we call earn money for life is . how the fiat currency is destroying the world as we know it . Such an outdated form of Economic and world Management is wasteful and dangerous.

A better system will only arise if you can understand current problems. So please don't stop just at this go lookup how money is made , how big corporations run the show from politics to new media to education to how human values are twisted through advertising. 

This constant produce and consumption is robbing earth of its finite resources.

Lets wake up from the this drugged slumber and invent better life for us all .
