Thank you for not trying to impress me with dramatic camera shaking and 1 second chop shots for 30 seconds. Good use of a classic song with the right amount of playtime. THat did better at setting up the drama than the visual manipulation I just mentioned. I see I need 10 lines of text for a review. I don't understand why I need to be more complex. Simple is CLEARER. I would love to see less drug, homosexual and nude scenes since media makes normalizing these activities as socially OK, fsociety. Keep your alternative sex style private. Safer for YOU. Good show so far. I've only seen the 1st but it motivates me to see another. Thanks again for not messing with the screenplay.
