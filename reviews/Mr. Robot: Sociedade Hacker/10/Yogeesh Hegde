This series is really promising... Pilot episode is outstanding... A nerd, whose mastery in network hacking is really going to make magic... Maybe this was the first pilot to have such dramatic events... Technical explanation given in the pilot was so accurate, most series will give fake technical information and almost always have impossible circumstances, but in this show we can except valid technical information; which is proved by mentioning some valid facts about "TOR networking" and "Onion routing protocol". I think anonymous person with alias "Mr robot"(It was written in his shirt) maybe kingpin to this whole series. Let's hope it stays the same....
