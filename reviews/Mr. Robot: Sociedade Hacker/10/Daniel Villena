Kudos to the director, all the creators, writers and actors of this show. I don't know how to describe it but its definitely different from all the current TV series i tried to watch.

The 'human drama' in it is intertwined with drug addition, capitalism, the dark side of technology and corruption - and the plot shows how it can affect the interaction & behavior of the characters in the story. For me, that blend of harsh social reality mixed with a good storytelling is what makes this show stand out from the rest.

Mr. Robot may not be a show for everyone.. but if you are looking for a new TV series that can tap the inner intellectual being in you - then this is a show that you shouldn't miss.
