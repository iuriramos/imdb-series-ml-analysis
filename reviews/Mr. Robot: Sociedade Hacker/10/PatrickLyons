This first season was very well done and you can tell that it may have not originally been filmed for TV and maybe for cable. The characters and story line carry itself very well. The dark contrast in the film and editing are very well done as well to set the mood. I like to think that as one who works as a programmer there are few shows that fit my liking. If I want something clean and funny I will go toward the Big Bang Theory. If I am looking for a show that is funny with no holds barred I recommend Silicon Valley, But if I want a suspenseful drama Mr Robot is definitely the series that I would recommend. We can only hope that the edginess of the characters, the story line, plot and the script that is in season 1 keeps on in future seasons to come.
