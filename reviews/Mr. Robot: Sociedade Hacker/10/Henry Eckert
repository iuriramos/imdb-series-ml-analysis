Mr Robot is quite possibly one of if not the best television programme I have ever watched. OK, firstly it is the first TV show that I have seen that has competently and consistently used the correct terminology when talking about computers, the only mistake that I noticed was one character's mispronunciation of the word "DDoS" and that's pretty subjective and nit-picky anyway. I usually refrain from watching shows based around tech as I am quite knowledgeable in that regard and it makes my cringe when they make silly errors, not the case here. 

The programme's format is similar to that of Dexter's, a narrated monologue as Elliot hunts a different target each episode, at least for the first few episodes. The writing was immaculate throughout, I was hooked instantly and ended up watching the whole series over a single weekend. OK, so here's where I'm going to go into slight spoilery territory so be warned. I found the gradual deterioration of Elliot's mental health throughout the series spectacular. You are given subtle hints at the beginning that Elliot may be having hallucinations but the way it comes together at the series' conclusion was mesmerizing. The ending to episode nine was particularly compelling leaving me with goosebumps and the homage to Fight Club with a piano rendition of The Pixie's "where is my mind" was a nice touch considering the show has clearly taken inspiration from that film. Anyway, I absolutely recommend this series to anyone with an interest in technology, as it certainly satisfies that demographic and even people that don't as it still holds up as a damn good and well written psychological thriller.
