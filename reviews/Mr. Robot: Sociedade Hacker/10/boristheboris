I think that the first 2 episodes were brilliant. I really like the theme and the atmosphere. The main character is very interesting and very relatable but he is not the only character i'm interested in. Which is a good thing.I really like when characters speak to themselves,it feels kinda real. In the third episode things started to annoy me. Some very predictable and clich√©d choices and some characters were just annoying. Especially one character ,who was very interesting in the first 2 episodes. The plot is smart and it has a great potential. I gave it a 10 because i really enjoyed it ,although it has minor issues.
