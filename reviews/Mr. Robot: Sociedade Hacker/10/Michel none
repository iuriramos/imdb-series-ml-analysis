Every episode has me sitting on the tip of my seat. At the end of each episode, I have to take a Xanax just to calm my nerves. From the start of episode 1 it got my attention and it never left. I must say I'm not a big fan of drug related subjects, but it's not like I'm watching 'Trainspotting'. I do think it's fair to give you a warning. I've overheard somebody say "all the hacks in the show are realistic". So if you're interested in hacking but never tried anything, you'll be tempted to. Now that I think of of it, it doesn't include the warning 'Do not try at home'. This is by far the most exciting show I've seen! I can only pray season 2 will be here SOON. I can recommend this show to everybody
