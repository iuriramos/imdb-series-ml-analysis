For anyone with doubts about whether they want to watch the show or not, do yourself a favor and watch the Pilot, you wont be disappointed. The show is about much more than hackers and computers, and takes us into a world must of us never see, the place where the 1% cool their heels. 

"Rami Malek" (Elliot) makes a believer of us within the 1st 5 minutes of the pilot and keeps us glued to the set for the next hour. In some ways his choices mirror the choices of people in todays society. 

My only criticism would be "Christian Slater" as Mr. Robot, while I like him as an actor, he just doesn't fit in the role of Mr. Robot. There are so many better suited actors that could have elevated the role. You really need a "Gabriel" (John Travolta) type character from Swordfish to complete the show.
