Absolutely riveting! I stumbled upon this show by chance from the title since I program robots. Although having nothing to do with robots it's still relevant to my interests! The show had me hooked within the first 5 minutes. I'm a huge fan of narration and believe when done correctly is gold! It just creates a deeper connection with the character. A Clockwork Orange, Fight Club, American Beauty to name a few.

Rami Malek playing the socially awkward Elliot Alderson is perfection. They couldn't have picked a better actor and it's nice to see Christian Slater on screen. I'm just finishing up season 1 and the twists, THE TWISTS!!!! I'm not a great reviewer... It's amazing and creative. The writing is phenomenal, just watch it so it stays on the air haha!

Oh, the filming is quite peculiar! Their faces are nearly always on the edge of the frame with strange angles. I've never seen anything like it and noticed it immediately. There's almost an emptiness being cultivated that intensifies Elliot's screwed up world. It's like everyone he interacts with is not there. An extreme sense of loneliness, which I happen to be all too familiar with. Great writing, directing and acting. I hope the seasons are plentiful!
