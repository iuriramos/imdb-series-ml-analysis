WOW! This show just keeps on giving. Once you think you've seen enough, the next episode comes along and blows the previous one away. The writers make it very personal, and they have a way to make you part of the show. In many ways what happens to Elliot, could happen to anyone. From the way he can be an ordinary everyday person, or a super hero or super villain the next, you're on a roller-coaster of emotions towards the character. Episode 7 prompted me to get off my b't and start writing about it. How did I start watching it? I can't remember now, but I think it was about my inclination towards computer sciences. But this show is much more than that. It's a drama that contains all aspects of a great show, and is sure to get it's audience of all ages (over 16) involved in a conversation at their next gathering.
