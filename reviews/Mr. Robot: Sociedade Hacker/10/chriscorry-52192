Pres. Clinton and the United States Marine Corps spent $3.8 millions teaching me to blow the whistle on this, I'm right in the middle of doing that. I figured since I'm now allowed to talk about it, I can give this web site proof I can talk about it, I'll tell you what the end game of the top 1% of the 1% is. They want to change the Constitution so they can bring about the kind of globalization they want, think modern dark ages. How they plan to do it is so strange I'm not even going to try yet, maybe in a year or so. This is a great show, with some interesting ideas, but let me say this, KEEP IT PEACEFUL!!! No matter what your being told there is a way for the military to step in and take control of the Country. Violence will bring that about very quickly, and the bad guys win. As long as you do the right thing for all the right reasons, you'll be surprised how much support you get, as soon as you try and profit from it you go down. If your trying to fix things what you do has to be a "truly selfless act." Last thing, when I was briefed in on this back in 1995, I was told Hollywood would play a role in this, I'd say this show is evidence that they where right about that too.
