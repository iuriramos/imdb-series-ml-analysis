This is the type of show that makes and defines an actor, a writer, and a director. Without going total fanboy on this show, it is everything you could ask for in a show. The character of Elliot is so endearing, he appeals to every emotion of the viewer. My one and only wish about the show, is that it wasn't on basic cable. I think allowing to be free of censorship would do the show some good, and it's a little ironic that it is censored. I am a little worried that it was renewed for a second season, as every episode has felt like a season finale, I am left to wonder what kind of cliff hanger there will be on it's actual season finale. And I do hope the whole evil corp plot line doesn't get played out and drag through the entirety of the show. To everyone involved in this show, I say Hello friend, and thank you. It has been too long since a show like this has been done, and I look forward to the future.
