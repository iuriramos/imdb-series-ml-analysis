In my opinion a show and its protagonist that connects with the audience and make them part of the journey is a winner. Mr.Robot does exactly that and does it with such brilliance. The pilot episode pulls you in from the very start and leaves you wanting more. You want to know what is going to happen next, You want to go on this journey with the lead character. I certainly did!

This is not your stereotypical show or your everyday superhero flick. We have enough of those already. This is different, its intriguing, it makes you think. 

Its intelligently written, wonderfully paced and with lot of mysteries. I was left with lot of questions in the end, but in a good way, like at the end of inception - we were left with questions like did the totem stop or is it still a dream etc, just like that there were many questions that leave the audience wanting more and I am sure as the show grows, each episode will answer these questions. 

Rami Malek does a great job as the show's protagonist and the rest of the cast do a good job as well.

10/10 I would recommend this to my mates. Watch it and I am sure you will feel the same way.
