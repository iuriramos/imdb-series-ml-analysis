So, I just ended watching Mr. Robot S01 and I must say I'm far more than impressed by it. One of the best series I've seen in a long time not just for the plot, the acting, but the whole world and constant changes it shows.

It started just for the hacking theme of it. First episode, I realized it was way more than that; taking the hacking/tech side, it's the most accurate depiction on TV and on film ever made. I know, it has to have some fiction but the names, software, actions used are like "wow" in terms of reality.

There are several kinds of characters that all bond perfectly in the series. Several well-known actors along with less or unknown ones make this a perfect mix that delivers flawless acting in your screen.

Ready for S02? Well, the series has been renewed already, and hope it keeps its pace because is crazy.

You cannot just blink or answer your phone because you will miss a key scene that will change everything else. One of the series that I just need to rewind a couple of times to get the whole scene. That is Mr. Robot.
