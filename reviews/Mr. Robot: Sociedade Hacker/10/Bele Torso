Elliot's internal dialogue with his therapist (spoiler); What disappoints you so much with society? Is it that we thought Steve Jobs was a great man even though we know he made millions off the backs of children. Or maybe its as though we feel all our heroes are counterfeit(like Lance Armstrong, Bill Cosby). That the world itself is just one big hoax, spamming with our running commentary of bullshit, masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy. We want to be sedated because its painful not to pretend because we're cowards.

and..."I am really good at reading people...my secret? I look for the worst in people." 

This is a show on the psychology of layers felt but rarely discussed. Not because we are afraid, because most just cannot. In Elliot, we get someone who is so lost inside and lonely, all he has is truth...truth to the point of tearing apart. The place most ignore. 

People like Elliot do exist. The non-conformists who won't sell out. Those who truly understand; You cannot get someone to understand something when their career depends upon them not understanding it.
