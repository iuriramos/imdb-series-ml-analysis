This is an insanely good show. Like how Lost and Prison break started a new era, this seems to be doing something similar. First episode was great 2,3,4,5 was mediocre at best and I gave it a rating of seven. After 6th and 7th episode and the rating changed to nine and after watching 8th and 9th, I want to give it twelve if possible. 

The story is wholly original and the pace is brilliant. Crazy good acting from all characters, although sometimes seems contrived, but put it into context and it all makes sense. This show is more about a different world than we currently experience and the direction is definitely worthy of an applause. Great job and keep 'em coming!
