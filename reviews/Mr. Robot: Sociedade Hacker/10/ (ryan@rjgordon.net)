As a computer programmer myself (one who has his fair-share of hacking knowledge), I am very impressed with just how accurate this show is. It doesn't feature the typical 'omg, we must hack into the NSA using a tron motorcycle' or big screen with a green matrix on it. In fact, the characters themselves make fun of hacker shows like that. Instead, every hack, every term coined, pretty much /everthing/, is completely realistic. 

The jargon is on point, and the hacking process displayed in the show is the actual process a real hacker would use. Social engineering, some doxing, some good old-fashioned brute force (which, like in the show, usually doesn't work).

10/10, the acting is great, the realism is amazing. Definitely worth watching, especially for those who know about computers.
