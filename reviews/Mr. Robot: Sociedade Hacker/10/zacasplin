This show is a commentary on a view of society. Yet it is following a story of a character and his life. People take the realism of the show to realistic and cant separate it from real world to TV world. Once separated you can see the idea of this show is not about cooperate evil, or the top 1% of 1%, but is about something every person can relate too... A relationship between a son and a father. Now who can't relate to that? You may not be a hacker, a anarchist but we all are sons and daughters and when a show can make you feel that again, its a show worth watching and after episode 6 season 2 that is done expertly.

If not watch, relate and enjoy the show.
