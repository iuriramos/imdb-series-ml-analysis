I should have been sleep a half hour ago, but I stayed up to create an account with IMDb just to leave this review. This was the best thing that I've seen on TV ever. it was the perfect blend of fight club, hackers, and the matrix.. minus the special effects, bullet time and the crazy martial arts inspired fight scenes. o.k. maybe its not so much like the matrix. but it definitely has a strong hackers, fight club feel.

I'm tempted to come up with a bunch of cool ways to describe the episode, and encourage more people to watch it thereby ensuring the longevity of the series. I really hoped that my first review would have been more altruistic, but this review is selfish in nature. I assume that they must have had the first 6 episodes in the can before releasing the pilot, but I want to find out what happens in the end. the only way that happens is if this show gets really popular, and manages to stay on the air for a few years.

But its late, I have to wake up really early, and the other reviews that I've seen are more then accurate. so just do yourself a favor and check it out.
