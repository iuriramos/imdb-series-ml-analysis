I just so happened to stumble upon the show and decided to give it a try because I am a programmer as well. And I am glad I decided to watch it that day. These guys have taken up a great theme and Rami Malek has done great justice to the lead character as well. We have seen movies on this genre but it is good to see an excellent series picking it up as well. The prospect of the world being run by faceless people is already quite popular in this skeptical modern world. The producers decided to have a go at it and executed it perfectly. I can sense that they are trying to build the thrill starting at the pilot episode itself. What can be hoped is that by the time the season gets over we shall be pretty satisfied (and more skeptical) about what just went down. Hopefully, this shall continue into the future episodes and, possibly, seasons as well.
