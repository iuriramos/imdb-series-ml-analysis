This is the show I have been waiting for. Currently there are few competitors for quality, substance and relevancy. There are a number of great dramas to be sure, but few live up to what Mr.Robot imbues. It is written by people that are aware of the grand issues in our time. 

It is a rare gift to create Television that is gripping, realistic and informative. It gives me wonder how long this fantastic biopic will last due to its ability to fly over its target without fear of disregarding political correctness or retribution from the establishment it is demonizing. Many topics of this nature end up watered down and made topical, so far Mr. Robot does not pull any punches combating subjects such as corporate fascism, privacy issues, cyber-terrorism, depression, substance abuse, modern slavery, nihilism et al. 10 thumbs up for Mr. Robot.
