I have created an account with IMDb today because I am in shock that Mr Robot is only just in the top 100 for TV Shows... This must be a mistake with IMDb's database because It has to be top 5 at least! 

Mr Robot is quite simply; brilliant. The only way to explain it is that it is like if Fight Club (Film) and Twin Peeks (TV Show) had an extremely clever and topical love child. 

It is truly second to second entertainment that never lets up. The characters are acted perfectly, the story telling is fascinating and a thrill ride that you will never predict, and most of all like no other series before it makes you want to dedicate a wall in your office to investigate and understand the story fully with charts and time-lines like some sort of obsessed detective in a gritty cop drama.

It is mind blowing and truly one of the best series ever created. I beg of you to watch it and give it a chance as you will not be let down, I can guarantee it!
