I liked season one, with putting into narrative the alienating nature of modern life and capturing the zeitgeist pretty well. The parallels with Dexter are pretty obvious (mainly the style of storytelling and some resemblance between the protagonists), but Mr Robot says a lot about society as well. In the first season we witness the preparations of a revolution and we see how the plan is put into action, with quite interesting side story lines. Great characters, well written. I didn't know, what to expect for the second season, but it exceeded all my expectations. It feels like Mr Robot fully realized its own style and dares to do more, than pleasing the crowds. The story flows quite slowly and it's clear, that it aims deeper this time. There aren't constant fireworks, but a lot of buildup instead. When something meaningful happens, you know it because the language of Mr Robot is clean, does not try to dazzle you in a way, like cheap entertainers would. You get meaningful drama, deep cynicism and great humor. I hope it continues this way, dares to be experimental, exceptional and stays away from cheap tricks and won't become a crowdpleaser. 10/10
