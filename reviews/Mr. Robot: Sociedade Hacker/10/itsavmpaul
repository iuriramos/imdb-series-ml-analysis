Let me be honest. When I chose to watch this series, I didn't have much of hope. But as soon as watched the premier of first season, I know that this is gonna be one of the series that's going to top my list.

The final episode of first season completes it with a bang and that says all about how good this series is and how good this series is going to be. I intentionally leave out the details of story, because I would like people, whoever decides to watch this series, to watch this series with a blank mind and experience the slow yet compelling ride the movie takes you. It is just awesome.

I would, however, say that the casting is brilliant. The background music is brilliant. Each and every detail of the movie is carefully planned. Wow !! I'm so glad that I decided to watch this series.
