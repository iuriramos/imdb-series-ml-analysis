Well USA channel have certainly picked themselves a winner with this one.

We are 2 episodes in and I am still not entirely sure what pieces fit where, but in a good way. 

Story follows a deeply flawed and troubled vigilante hacker named Elliot, who gets pulled into a underground hacking group.

I feel like this is a very groundbreaking show as the style is very similar to an 80s-90s cult(?) movie.

I can not put my finger on exactly why, but that is the vibe I get from this show.

Its slightly artsy in cinematography, but not enough to alienate viewers.

I feel like this has the potential to be one of those top 1% shows (GOT, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead etc.)

I am very excited to see where they take it.

Anyway, I think everyone can enjoy this show.

But check it out for yourself. I think you will be glad you did.
