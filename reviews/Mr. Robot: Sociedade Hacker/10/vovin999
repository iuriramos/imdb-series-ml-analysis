I love this show. It is clever, and somehow manages to be real enough to not make nerds like me frown while simultaneously being entertaining and suspenseful enough for a total computer illiterate. It doesn't hurt that the cast is great, and especially Christian Slater makes his character multi-faceted and charismatic. 

The Pilot will be your one hour gained or lost, and it is a great hour to be sure. I am sincerely hoping they do not cancel this one like another great show with Mr. Slater which was Breaking In. We are living in a new golden era of television, much thanks to intelligent creations like this.

I recommend it to anyone who enjoys smart shows with lots of intrigue. Not sold yet? Their team's name is fsociety, for f's sake!

Give it a shot!
