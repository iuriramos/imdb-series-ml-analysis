Thanks for the Truth a lot of people feel but are scared to tell. Many are going to say it's just a show, but please take more from it than just a show. Finally a reality show that doesn't say "Reality". Mr.Robot and Sleepy Hollow puts everything else on bottom shelf. Open Minded people will know what I'm saying.Please watch these shows and read more in to life then want you have been trained to use more of your brain and your feelings of truth when watching. Shows like this with substance are normally taken off quick do not let that happen to this one. If we do the system will win and poor and Truth bearers will shell fall victim. Thanks and be blessed.
