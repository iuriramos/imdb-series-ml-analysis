This is a show that even after reading the outstanding reviews , I was still impressed after viewing the Pilot. 

I was left wanting more, I want to binge watch it, but then I would know it would be all over in 1 day for me. This has huge potential, it kind of reminds me a little of the Matrix, good quality nerd speak (do not dumb this part down USA Network, I get so frustrated when movies are just ruined by poor terminology or believability) 

It has Dexter elements too, I love the talking to himself, paranoia. It works so well in this pilot. (and doesn't get old or feel stolen from dexter either which i think is a great achievement). 

The writing is outstanding, like Really really good. The directing is outstanding. The producing is outstanding. The cinematography is good, this is the TV show i've been waiting for since Dexter finished or Sons of Anarchy or Breaking Bad, and the Movie I've been waiting for since the original matrix. 

It will grow a cult following, but it will grow bigger, because such a high percentage of young people under 40 especially will eat this right up. It needs to be left nerdy, it needs to have more money thrown into it, to make sure the writing is complex, and then it will truly succeed IMHO. If the reviews stay at 9.4-9.5 it will end up being one of the biggest shows of all time. And it will earn royalties over the next 10-15 years more than anyone can imagine. Because its so good it will get streamed billions of times.
