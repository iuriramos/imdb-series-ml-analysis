I'm not a jeweler, but i recognize a diamond when i see it .. this is probably the best pilot i've ever seen. Everything about it is topnotch, especially the casting.

My only complaint is that they didn't release the whole season at once. I'm likely to get a nervous breakdown until the next part of Mr Robot.

I'm also happy to see that a young Swedish actor got his chance to shine in this show. I really think Martin Wallstr√∂m can contribute to this show and i wish him all the best in the future cause i think he is a talented actor with a lot of charisma. Doesn't he remind you of Cillan Murphy a little? I think we will see some nice interacting between him and the brilliant Rami Malik.
