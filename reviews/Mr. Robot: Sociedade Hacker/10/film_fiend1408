With possibly one of the best pilots in TV history, Mr.Robot immediately draws you in. The story mainly revolves around Elliot Anderson(Rami Malek), who is a hacking genius, is extremely shy and anti-social and is unable to connect to people in the ordinary sense. Instead, he hacks everyone he meets in an attempt to connect with them and in the process, helps a lot of people. He lives a life of solitude and hates his job, but then one day he's approached by a very mysterious man who goes by the name of Mr.Robot(Christian Slater), who seeks to recruit him for a top secret mission. 

This show is a great concept and is brilliantly executed (so far).It keeps you on the edge of your seat and is massively entertaining. Its likely that most viewers will relate to at least one of the characters, seeing that they cover such a broad spectrum of personalities, each with their own set of troubles. Its presented in a very unique way that feels fresh and innovative. The acting too, is brilliant and very convincing. I am very optimistic about this show and hope that it continues at the same pace it is currently going.
