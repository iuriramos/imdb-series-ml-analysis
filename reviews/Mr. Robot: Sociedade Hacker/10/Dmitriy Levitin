I am an engineer by trade. An a lot of the hacker movies that project these geeky kids, and following a wire, are patently false and not even close to reality.

This movie however breaks that mold. The realism of the computer hacking aspect and the paranoia that the main character feels, makes its a thrilling combination.

Plot: I must admit i have often thought that the rich become richer, and the middle class eroding. Capitalism and democracy wasn't set up for corporations to take over, but for people to live in equality. But with big money and lobbying, and super packs, money decides politics not people. So this show hits important points to society today.
