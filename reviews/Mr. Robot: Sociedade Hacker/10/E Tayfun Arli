It is quirky! 

The story is good, but how it has taken the story around and around, taking it to the end is amazing!

But mostly, the music! : The soundtrack is out of this world, for the first time I have turned up the sound to the maximum, specially at the end of Season 1, Episode 6 despite this being not Hans Zimmer!

Some acting is a bit overdone and not so impressive but you don't mind when it is alongside some of the brilliant lines uttered by really good actors.

It is believable, I get the tech parts, and I love the locations too.
