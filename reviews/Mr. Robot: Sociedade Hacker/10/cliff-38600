This work is quite possibly the best piece of media I've seen in years! And I've seen a lot of movies and TV series and read volumes of books.

The character development, perspectives, plot, storyline, soundtrack, editing, ALL AMAZINGLY WELL EXECUTED ! Actor selection also. Great direction. truly a piece of art. V for Vendetta meets Breaking Bad meets Fight Club.

I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone and hope it scoops up all the awards. Interested to see season 2 but would suggest that they don't even make it.

My favorite series was Jericho and that only lasted two seasons. Because sometimes. The story is told. and thats how it should be and is I believe the case here....Hope they don't ruin it ! Especially for commercial reasons !!! WHICH WOULD BE SO AGAINST THE STORY OF MR ROBOT !!

Well done and thank you for the journey.

I ate up the entire first season in a day.
