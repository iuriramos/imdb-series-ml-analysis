Now, I don't usually write reviews, but just the pilot of this series leaves me no other choice.

It's intelligent, it's dark, at times it feels a little "Fight Club"-esque in all the right ways, it's fast paced but not overly hurried.

In short: It takes its audience seriously, and most importantly doesn't shy away from being complex, especially in the technical area. While most "bad elite hacker"-plots usually just serve to make everyone halfway familiar with a terminal cringe painfully, it seems the writers in this case did their homework (well, as much as it's feasible for a show that's still trying to be entertainment rather than a hacking documentary). With just a bit more story, the pilot alone felt as if it could have been a full-length movie, despite only being the prelude to a promising plot. And there is hope that, like with other rather gloomy-themed series (like Fargo, True Detective or Marvel's Daredevil), the already quite vivid characters will gain in complexity later on.

So, consider me sold. I'm really looking forward to the next episode, and so should you.
