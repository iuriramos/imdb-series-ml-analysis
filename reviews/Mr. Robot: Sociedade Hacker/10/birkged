The screenplay is exceptional, about as good and as topical as it gets, however: This would have gone NOWHERE without an extraordinary actor to pull off the lead character (and the sophisticated direction necessary to produce that acting). They hit a grand slam with their choice, Rami Malek. I had not personally seen him before, the role reads as though he were born to play it. Not that this makes it easy, this looks to be a significantly sophisticated performance by a young actor in the role of his career (I'm guessing) to date. Add in a serendipitously psycho Christian Slater thespian study (yeah, that was easy!) and you get something really fun, remarkably fast, and on top of todays headlines. Enjoy!
