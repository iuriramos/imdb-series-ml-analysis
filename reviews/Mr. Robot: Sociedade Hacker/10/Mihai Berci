This is absolutely fantastic. I simply love it. All of it! I just watched the first episode and i am thrilled about it. The amount of details they give about everything is perfect, the authenticity is also ridiculously good. I love it's unpredictability although it gives enough signs but they're perfectly blended so you got to be very attentive to get them, it's like Game of Thrones but this masterpiece(i can't call it a simple show) has a way better subject than GoT. It is looking our world's problems in the eyes and exposes them without any curtain or filter (those shots with real life celebrities were spot on). I can't stop eulogizing this masterpiece, it is absolutely fabulous. I love the schizo-problems genius theme and the monologues are great. I also love the mysterious guide who guides the main character into becoming the hero he's meant to be theme. The picture is also great, i love the close shots, the blurs, the cold set of colors. The sound doesn't shine out of the regular so here there is no plus. I didn't got a good look at the acting as i was thrilled about the subject and everything mentioned above, but i can say that Rami Malek was an excellent choice, his eyes and look are meant for this role. For the things i've said above i give this show 10/10 and declare myself as one of the greatest fans of it. I am waiting for episode 2 with my breath held.
