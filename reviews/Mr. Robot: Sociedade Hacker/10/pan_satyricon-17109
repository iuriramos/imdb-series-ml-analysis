Watched the pilot on a whim and was completely engaged in the first three minutes, and the next sixty-one that followed just kept building on that initial engagement.

Excellent writing with actual attention to technical detail with minimal dumbing down, and exceptional acting from the lead, who managed to pull off detached, alienated, and utterly charismatic all at once).

Cinematography was solid throughout, with the palette and framing reflecting the lead's mental state, surreal camera work during the final sequence, and tons of background details adding to the immersion and fleshing out of the world in which the main character exists.

I genuinely can't remember the last time I felt so immediately and fully invested in a television show and so eager to see the next episode...PLEASE give this one a try and spread the word!
