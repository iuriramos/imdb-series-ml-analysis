Another winning Dexter style formula of hero, the wife and I enjoyed this program a great deal and think this is a winner.

Modern, gritty and self medicating

a good cast and well acted, the lead character is instantly likable and i know enough IT guys to see bits of some of them in there.

watching him act in peoples lives and his struggle with his own mind is quite a refreshing scene in this day and age, i grew up with mechano and buckets of lego, this generation has a world of knowledge and with the right know how can get under the skin of anyone they meet, scary and cool in a happy bundle

keep making this one!!
