I was blown away - much more than I expected. The acting and writing is excellent all round. Not just the lead actors shine(Rami Malek is outstanding), the supporting roles are very well cast. Portia Doubleday is very good. Even Gloria Reuben, who I've never really cared for, does a believable job as the therapist. I'm assuming Christian Slater is here to stay given the show is named after a name tag on his jacket. Too bad about that name though - all I could think of was that Styx song... I agree with previous comments that from a technical standpoint the show is far more accurate than most of the hacker movies and television shows out there. How refreshing to have a tech-based thriller without all the floating transparent touch screens. All in all, the best pilot I have seen this year - and I'm including Better Call Saul in that list. I only hope it comes out in Canada on June 24 as it is in the U.S. Showcase has picked it up here but they haven't announced a date, only that it is "coming soon".
