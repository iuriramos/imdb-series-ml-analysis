Watched up to episode 6 and loving how it is building up nicely. Pity the other reviewers who bailed after episode 3... I'm now sensing some of the earlier scenes will have pay off down the road and so I recommend sticking with it.... the pilot episode is a barometer of the series as a whole and not a one off.

The different plot lines are all individually interesting and the pace of how they are concluding holds the attention by giving moments of high suspense and gripping resolution whilst still leaving the sense that more is to come.

Don't know anything about hacking but am told it is technically accurate... not that this really matters. Elliot is mesmerising and Tyrell's character equally so, though now less predictable in terms of where he will end up. Visually I think it looks great and the metronomic score helps build the excitement brilliantly.

I'm not an anti capitalist but everyone likes an underdog story... I now find myself desperate for each week to pass for the next episode, which is always a good sign.

Go on Elliot you crazy drug addled weirdo! I'm rooting for you!
