Though its the start but all in all watching the first episode has motivated me to watch it more and its just like more real. I think in my reviews its my 2015 TV show in this year. wish some guys watch this also. The TV show reveals how reality our world is with computers and how to safe guard ourselves from bat attacks. Its somewhat to say a knowledgeable show that i presume that everyone can watch this in this current year. hopefully awaiting for the next release of episode 2. I am not fond of some crime plays but this is somewhat to see.Elliot the hacker reveals how life and science can reveal itself in this life and its somehow real.
