Well, was not expecting it to make me a fan with just the first episode but yes it did. It's not just about the hacking and computer programming, it's much more than that. You see Frankie Shaw, she seems a dealer at first and then you see her life inside as the story moves along she has dreams and she wants a home and life like normal people. She seems very cute with the role she is playing in and yes you'll fall in love with her with the dreams she has. The story turns in every episode in an amazing way. The way main character narrates everything, it sinks you more in the story and yes all characters put the effort to make you fall in love with them! It reflects the social circus going on around us. The social circus of the way of the world. As I'm a computer student sitting out there, to all computer students Elliot will put a coding passion in you. excellent rated from me!
