This show is better than breaking bad and game of thrones combined. The acting is good, the story is good, the dialogues are good, there has not been one point I have been bored. They have not made a single mistake everything lines up perfectly. Rami Malek (who plays the main character called Elliot) is perfect for the role he plays. And all other actors fit perfectly fine in their role too. I can not think of one thing that is not done perfect in this show. Like I say in the title this show has been a joy to watch. At this moment the show is at episode 9 and I think there is only one episode left in this season but this show is not breakable for me anymore. My rating an 10 out of 10.

For me the best show of 2015.
