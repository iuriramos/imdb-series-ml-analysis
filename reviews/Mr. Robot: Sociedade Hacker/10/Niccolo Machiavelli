I'm at episode 10 right now...

I thought i'll never see a great modern show again... This is just freekin perfect. The story is consistent, the acting is above average, Rami Malek is just great as a depressive schizophrenic, supporting roles are not just some meaningless figures - they actually have significant depth and meaning. I love the camera movement, and the fact that the main figures are often not in the center of the frame causing some extra work of the brain to get the frame and the story in balance - so when you watch the show, even when you watch it without thinking, it still makes your brain active in a additional level to the usual operational level.

The music is great. My God, the last 5 min of the 9th episode - i watched it 5 times, it is one of the best 5 min i've seen in the last decade of watching television.

Moments of Swedish language...i mean, that's just a small thing in the whole show but those few lines in that language just adds some freekin mystery to the whole story. I would kiss the guy who said: hey, why not let them speak Swedish. I don't care what the reason was but it's a genius move if you ask me.

No sexual aggressiveness, no unnecessary violence, no meaningless dialogs, no cheap tricks at all.

Subtle and brilliant. Already a classic. Love it! Love it! Love it!

Good work the whole crew.
