The cinematography and sound re-create the cool, chaotic, and chilling unease of Aronofsky films like Requiem for a Dream and Pi. I can definitely see a connection to Fight Club as well, both with the mood and the beautiful inner monologues. I see references to Dexter also, as the monologues often focus on Elliot's inability to connect "normally" with others and the plot itself mimics Dexter in that Elliot essentially moonlights as the antagonist to his daylight self, hacker v.s. security agent. Unlike Dexter and Fight Club's Tyler Burden, Elliot appears far more emotionally sensitive (naturally, without the addiction to self-help groups) and does not carry out his justice according to a strict creed of violence, but rather through anonymous tips and expert framing. I also see a nod to the directorial themes of Michelangelo Antonioni (Italian Neorealism), with the emphasis on alienation in a large, busy, or distant modern world; for example scans of the massive billboards and buildings and the constant suspicious stares of men in suits or deadpans of passersby. Unlike Antonioni, who's cinematic conversations deliberately trailed off into somewhat unbearable uncertainty, Sam Esmail zooms his lens on a more specific and perhaps more translatable realm, the digital age through the perspective of its best hackers. As audience to this new series, I hope to comfortably "hack" my way through Elliot's disturbingly penetrative exploration of contemporary life. Rami Malek's performance is gritty, honest, subtle, and mesmerizing. The script is pointy, poetic, and I feel reveals deep truths of human interaction and of the new age inner psyche. Bravo!
