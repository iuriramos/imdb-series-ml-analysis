I've watched the whole of series one & eagerly awaited each episode since the first. Inside everyone is a little bit of Elliot. Maybe not as #Â£%ed up but still a little bit of him is inside us all but maybe not as obvious. With each weekly session he's been opened to us with a new aspect of what we all hide, whether it be our dream of a shinning white armor hidden in beneath our dark & dreary daily dress, our secret vice that calms & soothes our darkest dreams & stormiest nights, our lost loves (that may have not quite been there - real or not), & our fogged perception of what is our world around us. For some dark & for some torpid reason I click with Elliot. He is real & not a Disney fairytale in 21st century 3D 4k color. Watch it. It's well worth the effort. The closing track seems to encompass the whole of series 1 - where is my mind? I eagerly await season 2. :)
