The story is very deep and heavy, and the characters development is in my opinion flawless. It's shot in an interesting way, breaking standard filming angles. I recently re-watched it and did so on two days, because every episode leaves you wanting more, and it's even better the next time because of their extraordinary work at details. The moment I realized it's all in his head I had to pause the video because it became to overwhelming. My favorite part is the inner monologues he keeps having, which makes it much easier to become emerged in the plot and characters. This show got 10/10 from me because I reckon I will remember this for the rest of my life, and the insight and expansion I got was very rewarding.
