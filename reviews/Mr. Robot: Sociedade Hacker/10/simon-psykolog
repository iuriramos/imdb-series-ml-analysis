Others have given a good synopsis of this wonderful first season so I will just focus on what I think makes it stand out.

There is a bearing plot that follows through the season. It progresses in a perfect tempo and still lets other subplots emerge and find resolvement. In my view, pace, especially in a series, is a delicate matter. Most often a story is prolonged in absurdity but this is not the case with Elliot Alderson and his friends, family, colleges and demons. The story often takes some "point-of-no-return" directions which feels so refreshing and actually surprising.

Elliot Alderson is a well constructed protagonist. He has his dark sides and at first I was afraid that this would follow the all to known script where the really brilliant character is portrayed with a dark and destructive side that just adds to his heroism. Elliot's dark side(s) has an actual impact on the story and is furthermore shown in a way that challenges the audience in a brilliant way in deciding Elliot's level of sanity/insanity and as a further consequence what meaning a specific situation should be given.

His talent, that anything with a microchip, can become his uorganic bodily extension, is exaggerated to a certain degree but its nothing I am going to dwell upon.

Rami Malek, who plays Elliot Alderson, does so in a very restrained way. He is thoughtful in such a way that you almost become concerned if he is mentally present in social situations which maybe is exactly the point. Furthermore he (inter)acts almost without any expression and I think that this is an expression of a big artistic gamble as the risk for us to be indifferent towards him.

I really look forward to meeting Elliot, fsociety and Evil corp. again very soon.
