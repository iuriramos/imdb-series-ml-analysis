The teasers on USA got me to look into this. The free first episode on Amazon was a good idea. I watched it and I was hooked. Very intelligent, thought provoking and entertaining. The main character is intriguing mostly for his faults. This looks like it's shaping up to be a season-long story, rather than episodic, which is the best way to tell the tale. I don't know if the Christian Slater character will add or detract from the story (even though he's the title character). His success rate with TV shows is abysmal, but he might work out as a supporting character. I hope the 'techno-babble' is kept to a minimum. If it's accurate it's usually boring, and if it's wrong it invites a chorus of "Oh no you didn't!" from the nerd crowd. You can talk about technology without getting into the hardware.
