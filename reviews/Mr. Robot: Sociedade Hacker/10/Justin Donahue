I am gonna go ahead and tell you that Mr Robot is easily my new favorite show on TV. This show follow the hacker Elliot and he suffers from the problem of social anxiety and he is not able to connect with people. I have not seen a show that is so well written and acted and directed since the first season of True Detective and all of Breaking Bad. The performances from Rami Malek, Christian Slater, and the whole rest of the cast is some of the best acting their is on TV right now if not the best. This show is also incredibly well filmed and the cinematography really makes you fell the gritty and dark tone the show has. The show also has some huge plot twist near the end which some people may not love but I thought it was incredibly well done and it really helped develop all the characters. Every episode of the season helped develop the character and their was always something going on that was engaging. If this show keep this up it has potential to be my favorite TV show of all time. I strongly recommend watching this show if you have not seen it yet.
