I have seen Rami Malek grow as an actor but he really found his place with this role. Very good acting, awesome production and the music editing is what really puts the cherry on top of the Sunday. This show has an aura of dark thriller and unintended vigilance that makes everything intriguing. Kind of a 'Dexter' mixed with 'the social network'. I really like Christian slater here as well. He plays a mysterious and somewhat care free guy. I was surprised by how well Malek acted too it's if he was born to play this role. If you want a show with mystery, excitement and a kind of sociopath vigilante you should really check this out. The hacking also seems realistic compared to many other shows.

Pilot was great i think this might be my new favorite show.
