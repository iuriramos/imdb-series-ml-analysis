I cannot believe some of the bad reviews I have read on here. What are you people thinking? I have to question what, if any television show do these people deem worthy. Everyone wants to compare it to The Matrix or Dexter or Fight club. It is it's own entity. We can easily trace The Matrix from Equilibrium and so on and so forth but regardless this is good TV. Do not read reviews from people that cannot make it through one episode. There are turns and twists here. Give something a chance before you rip it up. In a time when mindless reality television is ruling the airways, here is something that is not only thought provoking but relevant and entertaining. That is hard to come by these days. Sure it takes from this and that...BUT SO DOES EVERYTHING CREATIVE! This is one of the best things I have seen on TV in a while. I would like to know from those who gave this bad reviews? Just what are you watching that is good right now? If this is so bad, what exactly do you find good?
