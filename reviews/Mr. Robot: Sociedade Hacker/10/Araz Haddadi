I've always loved TV-shows that make me question reality - few shows has ever done that in a convincing man√©r. Well.. this is certainly one of them.

First of all let's get this straight, I was NOT sure about the lead (Rami Malek), I had never heard of him nor seen him act.. but boy am I GLAD they chose him. I mean, this man can act!! He made me fall in love with his character in just 6 minutes. He is smart (actually very smart) but he is not perfect and that's precisely what I love about this Eliot character - he's deeply flawed and he knows it. He is feels utterly alone and suffers greatly because of it. This loneliness makes him have deep and controversial monologues with the made up person in his mind (the audience). He questions his sanity over and over again and even so he doesn't give up his resolve - that the wrong doers of this era (the 1% of the 1%, as he puts it) deserve to be put to justice.

I also like the tech-y aspect the director went with, which I find very appropriate to this informational era. Eliot makes very strong arguments regarding the issues surrounding too much dependents on tech and how some people might use it in order to make a lot of money, and in some cases in VERY illegal ways. 

All in all, amazingly well acted TV-show with brilliant writing.
