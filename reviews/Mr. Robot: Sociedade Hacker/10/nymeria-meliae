I wouldn't normally write a review based on a pilot but this one really deserves attention and someone needs to question those low star comments. 

Firstly, this pilot episode has good photography, good acting - the lead actor is definitely one to look out for in the future, and a good plot that actually attempts to engage hacking properly - sure they have to cut a few corners for entertainment's sake - you can't spend days or weeks trying to crack a password in a TV drama but at least there are attempts at social engineering and awareness of terms. 

Now to address those low star comments... 1) Politics... this drama has a left wing agenda that is going to upset a few of those on the right. However, you shouldn't make a review that is clearly influenced by your politics and not what is on the screen

2) This drama expects you to know some tech-speak... it is not overly complex but you should know things like DDOS attack, Tor, Onion encryption etc. At a guess expect more... â€Žjudging by the plot, Low Orbit Ion Cannon and rootkit are going to be dropped in there at some point in the future. Rather than attack the program for your own ignorance, perhaps make a note of some of the terms and look them up - thus educating yourself. 

3) Christian Slater was probably chosen because of his earlier films like Pump up the Volume and Heathers... that really defined him as an actor, maybe less so for the TV comedy Breaking In.
