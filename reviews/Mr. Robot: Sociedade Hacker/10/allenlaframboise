Just watched episode 10 season 2, 5 times in a row ....back to back.... wow wow wow wow wow. Stunning. The best episode of the season. I am afraid to spoil any of it with even a hint of what happened , just say the art and the timing ,and the writing just blew me away. Or was it the fifth of brandy .Don't know don't care, as always a much watch .This is a look into another dimension or am I just a projection looking at the real world. Wow wow wow wow wow.This actually reminds me of films like blade runner, A clockwork orange and 28 days later. It had me standing beside myself. I had to watch it over and over and over again each time just being transported. And that is what we want, and need.
