I noticed this gem just through from the thumbnail and gave it a shot. Me and a friend of mine watched this and were simply intoxicated with how accurate and raw the show was depicting this subject matter. The entire time we were hooked on what would come next, not just from the story but from the characters as well. The serious, dark, and sometimes comedic atmosphere was everything that I could have hoped for. If a show can keep me this engaged and push me to actually think past just what is being shown, i'm all for it. The last time something of this caliber came along was too long ago. I really hope this gets picked up. I want to see what happens next. Please make this a reality.
