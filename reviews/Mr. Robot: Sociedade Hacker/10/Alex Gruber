Let me start off by saying this is one of the most interesting and exciting shows I've watched to date. The pilot could have easily been split up into a couple of episodes as so much happened. This keeps the show extremely interesting and the view yearning for the next episode.

I also like how the show is tends to be unpredictable. Of course some parts are predictable, the directors do a great job at keeping this minimum. I don't want to add any spoilers so I will keep it brief. So many shows nowadays have mundane scenarios where the outcome is obviously suspected. This show will leave you saying "wow, no way" after many of the scenes and episodes. 

I know the show is still in the first season but so far, it is very promising. I advise all of you to give it a chance and you will be hooked!
