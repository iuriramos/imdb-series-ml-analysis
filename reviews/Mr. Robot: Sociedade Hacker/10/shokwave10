Excellence is the one word to describe what this show is in general.

I still don't know/can't realize how much this show means to me.. Its been only 6 episode so far and I just can't wait for new one very time it ends(and boy am I gonna be sad when a season is over and I have to wait for +100 days for another one :X (No..Noo..NOOOOOO))

Everything from acting to storytelling is great(hell, even camera work stands out from other shows). I've never been this impatient for a protagonist to talk to me, way he engages you in his work telling you to start thinking of solutions because you're in this mess with him..I LOVE IT!

RECOMMENDED for everyone to at least give it a try because it deserves it!
