The first episode is like the a small movie with its only plots and twists, and an curious ending. Those are normally the traits of a good TV series.

Maybe I'm biased because I felt deep connection with him. I'm a programmer, too, but I don't hack and I don't break the law, I share his view of society anyway. Some people may find his view childish and exaggerated, but I like the way the writer sharply pointed out the hypocrisy of our modern day life and the seemingly freedom in capitalism. I'm not saying I support the claims of conspiracy in the show, I'm saying I like when people are being blunt and honest, if you are like me in this regard, you'll find this show quite enjoyable(even more if you are also a computer geek).

The other thing I like about this show is that other shows that involves computer technology are usually very vague on the technical side and just throws jargons around without understanding them or trying to make sense. It's exciting to see a show that engages real geeks with real things that real geeks might get excited about and at the same time enjoyable to other people who are not so tech-savvy.

It's a great show for everyone, especially for those who are not ones who live in "the reality of the naive".
