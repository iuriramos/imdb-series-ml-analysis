Holy crap, I love this show! How did this get on the USA network? It should have been gobbled up by HBO or Showtime.ï»¿

This show is like the computer and networking equivalent of a medical or legal drama / thriller, something that's been sorely missing in TV.

USA put the entire pilot online (check YouTube). Everything about this is great: the acting, the script, the casting, the technical accuracy. None of that NCIS "four hands on the keyboard" and "I'll crack your 4K RSA key in 3 minutes" BS. I've never understood why obscure medical terminology is OK, but real computer and networking terminology is practically forbidden.

I could actually watch without constantly being knocked out of the story with stupid TV-OS made up garbage. This will be, by far, my favorite show of the season.
