At the conclusion of the pilot episode, the main character asks the audience if we are seeing what he is seeing. The answer is yes! And we definitely want to see more and more. The challenge for this new USA show is to maintain the same level of grit and uncertainty throughout the season, and hopefully seasons to come. The performances are all top notch and nuanced in their own way. The addition of Christian Slater seemed odd, initially. As the titular Mr Robot, I am curious to see how how his character will develop. I have high hopes for this show and was riveted by the pilot. It's not pretty to watch, and that in itself is a key selling point. One scene, shot in times square dulled down the atmosphere to present a muted colour palette that suits the tone of the show. The mist exciting new show of 2015. 10/10
