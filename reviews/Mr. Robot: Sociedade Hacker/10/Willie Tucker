This is my first review, so please try and be considerate. It's what any techie would want out of a tech TV show! It has everything a person could want in a show, minus the gratuitous sex which I don't mind. I can't find anything wrong with the show. If I could think of one thing that I don't like about it would be that it's on network television, so there is a limit to what they can actually say or do. I feel like I've been waiting for a show like this for years! I"m hoping that the producers can find a way to stretch the show for at least 5 seasons. I'm excited to see how deep they can go with the story line. It's on the second season so I suppose only time will tell how far the show goes.
