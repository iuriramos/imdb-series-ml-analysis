When my friend suggested me to watch the first episode of a TV show, I asked him about its title. "Mr Robot ?", I decided immediately to seek for it. Each episode was a perfect movie of 45 minutes to watch. The way each scene have it's own vision angle and sound background makes you live with the story. Talking about the story, I could understand a lot of things about the hacks due to my field of studying. But I noticed that it wasn't so difficult for my friends who study economics and even literature. The cool thing about Mr. Robot it's that makes you think about it even after the end of an episode. (Spoiler alert! Stop here) In the final episode, after I watched that Chinese person joining the party. I went to my bed wondering where and when did I see him. "Did I see him in another movie or what ?", then I remembered that he (or maybe she) was the mysterious creature who helped Elliot with nothing and went away. That is the kind of TV shows I would recommend to anyone interested in excellent stories to watch.
