Mr. Robot's debut episode flows so smoothly that you don't realize an hour has passed. Interesting characters that are already fully developed, including the lead who brings out your inner geek, make this show incredibly interesting and enjoyable to watch. Being a life long Neil Diamond fan, I was especially surprised and enthralled to hear "If You Go Away" begin playing as a back drop to the lead character's walk to his destiny. All the while the viewer is contemplating what his decision will be. You can see and begin to understand his thought and decision processes. I highly recommend this show. The best I have seen on television for quite a while.
