maybe the best new series i've seen in a long while. story is credible, capturing the zeitgeist very well. shot framing is captivating, pacing on point, and possible the high note of the whole production, the soundtrack, is simply outstanding!

you can certainly see similarities to the girl with the dragon tattoo, seeing they share the same director. it has the same eerie "something i wrong" feeling. but it is a bit faster paced with nice catch phrases in-between. in general the writing of the dialogs is so good, even side characters feel like real human being after just a scene or two, for example Gideon. Those little details make a show and in this case, they got it right. kudos.

all in all, i hope they are able to keep the momentum that they built up with this pilot.

i'm so excited for the rest of the season.
