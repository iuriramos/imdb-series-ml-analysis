The spoilers are towards the bottom. I really don't want to ruin it for anyone so, do not keep reading until you've watched season 1. I am always searching for something new and unique to watch. I'm movie enthusiast and that's what I use my TV time for the most. I like plot resolutions that don't take 5 years to find out. However, sometimes a series has such a great idea that it drags me in like Mr. Robot does. When I got to the 9th episode, I even yelled out in excitement. I've seen this before but wasn't expecting it! The series had already been taking it much further and I don't feel cheated because of a similar plot. I didn't have any expectations going into it at first but I will for season 2 because this is gold. They just need to keep up their character development and try not to be too clever. Watching does take patience but I found it's worth it, so long as you don't try to binge it all at once. 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HERE ARE THE SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is Fight Club 1999 without the fight club. Same idea to destroy the world's financial records but with hacking instead of bombs. Elliot Alderson has the same split personality disorder as Tyler Durden. This manifests much the same way the movie does and has me going back to re-watch episodes and scenes. I like to be surprised and the writers did just that. It was also a lot of fun when they subtly played the piano instrumental of "Where is My Mind" by The Pixies. This has so many more possibilities and can't wait to see more!
