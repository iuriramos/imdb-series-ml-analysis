Where do I even start? This show is absolutely fantastic! Like most people I didn't expected much. I mean c'mon who could possibly imagine a show about hacking could be exciting? But dude, Mr. Robot hit me like a hurricane.

I had a hard time getting into the story for the first three episodes, I didn't enjoy Rami Maleks character (and I still don't but later on that) and the topic was just not mine but the story quickly proved itself interesting and slowly built up the finale very nicely. I gave the show 8 stars after season 1. And then DAMN season 2 kicked off and got me hooked right from the start. I spend an entire Sunday binge watching and forgot to eat because I was so thrilled. The pacing was absolutely on point. Shocking twists popped up EVERYWHERE (while totally making sense) and all of the characters were able to shine.

While were at it lets get to the best part of the show: the characters. Especially the females. While I'm not a fan of Rami Malek nor his character Elliot just because I find his monotone voice and his crazy eyes hard to stand, I still have to admit he's a strong lead and plays his role superb. But the real stars here are the girls. Angela is bold, Darlene is fierce, Joanna is frightening and I have no idea what the heck whiterose is but he/she/it is outstanding. My highlight though, was the addition of Dominique, I have to see how she develops further but shes a potential candidate to take my number one spot of my all time fav TV characters. Everything that happened around her this season was major thrilling and I don't want to wait another year to see Grace Gunner take this fantastic role to the next level. Bravo.

All in all I highly recommend this series to basically everyone. 10/10
