Hello readers, This series is a must watch! It's a great story and very realistic.

I was surprised by how interested I was!! The name MR Robot didn't give me the feeling it would be that good...I even thought that it would be kind of a sci-fi, but it's not!

Actors are great too! Camera technique is very good! Story is very catching and every minute is interesting! 

Normally i need some violence in a movie, but this one doesn't need it for sure!

Now I want to see more of this and I'm sure there are more peeps like me who are addicted now!
