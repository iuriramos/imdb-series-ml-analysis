This one promises a lot of potential. I do enjoy the use of a narrator into some stories, and, in this one i really believe is something that makes the difference. The action is well paced and the main actor is very accurate for this role, a Young, weird, and intriguing young guy. The story itself may keep you a little aside, especially if you don't care\like about all the hacking stuff, but as the show starts you will be sure that, that's just one part, there is plenty of other issues and that's why the show is so involving, I guess. Now i will write the same, i always write, about why is important to give you vote, because in this case this will make the difference between a good show and a great show with more and more positive reviews(from people that actually watch the show, not just ears about it)Every time I do the shows review is because I do believe some shows are more than just good or great, they are imperative to watch, because we cannot pass through life without paying attention to some things that are really worth to be noticed, a lot of rubbish is dumped on TV, but a lot of art is also available, you just have to make a choice, and i really want you to chose this one here MiscellaneousUnpaired symbol: '(' seems to be missing;)
