Mr Robot is what Earth needs at our evolutionary stage. Only very few shows attempt to be as accurate and honest about how our world operates. We are currently enslaved by debt through multi-national financial conglomerates that push humanity to oblivion. Mr Robot clearly shows how it works and gives us hope for an extremely simple solution. Eradicate debt. All countries are in debt to these conglomerates and there is no apparent solution besides revolution. I hope this show remains to it's roots and takes the opportunity to wake up the masses. Even though the hero is a drug-addict schizophrenic geek he is exactly what 99% of Earth population needs, someone who is crazy enough to see truth as it is, going beyond human normalities to explore the untouched and not succumb and be fooled by our own expectations, fears and delusions. Mr Robot + Interstellar = Earth 2.0
