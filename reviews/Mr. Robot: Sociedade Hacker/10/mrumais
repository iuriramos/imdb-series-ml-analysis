So, not having much of a knowledge about this show or not having much anticipation, I just watched the show and now I'm glad I did.

So many cool things for me in this show. Well for starters,

1) A hacker story 2) A lonely character with a computer (sounds like me) 3) A vigilante (Well, that alone is enough for me to watch it for years) 4) Spoiled society (Screw it)

As a huge fan of Person of Interest, I'd say I've fallen in love with this show. (Yeah yeah, the pilot)

The story, acting, screen play and the casting are so good. The show kept me on edge from the starting. One great pilot and I'm so glad I watched. Looking forward for next ep.
