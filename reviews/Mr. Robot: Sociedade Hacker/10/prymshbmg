Very good pilot I liked the way story goes and doesn't add any crap in the screen play. Show good hacking tactics of the character and assumes that viewers are human and have mind that can understand. Show features real environment of computer security, Servers, and Hacking environment. Though the show falsely targeted the Indian Ethinicity being edict to Illegal porn & sex edict, this may induce controversy and show may loose some of the viewer in that respect. But I recommend the show should revolve around a good storyline and get far from controversies. Finally a good series about computer hacking. Now I think writers have Upgraded their OS of their mind.
