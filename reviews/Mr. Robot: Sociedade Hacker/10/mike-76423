Thats right, tell it like it is style, straight to the point, this series doesn't waste any time in progressing and telling it like it is, great production too, great acting, great plot, in a world where everyone is hacking the s*** out of everyone, its only a matter of time before serious c.warfare kicks in that will effect everyone on a day to day basis - notice they delayed the last episode by a week due to the on air shooting, but did you also notice in that same week there was a massive collapse in the Chinese stock market which in turn affected western markets, this was also comparable to that last episode in which the hack on financial institutions was initiated - interesting stuff! Cant wait for season2, hopefully it will be allowed on air, was quite surprised this one was, some useful bits of info in there if you clock it...BIG RESPECT to the whole production crew on this one, keep up the good works 10STAR
