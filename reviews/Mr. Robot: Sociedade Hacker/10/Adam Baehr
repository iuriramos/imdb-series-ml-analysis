Holy Smokes. I absolutely fell in love with this series. I was late to the party but I'm glad that I hopped onto the train because man oh man was it worth it. I will start my review with the story which follows a man by the name of Elliot who is a hacker and it's about how his story and the world around him unfolds. The acting is honestly Incredible with every hiring decision being Impeccable. Rami Malek who plays Elliot is genius and Christian Slater who plays Mr.Robot is Awesome as well but my favorite actor was Tyrell Wellick. He is played by Martin Wallstrom who is perfect. He is a mix of Patrick Bateman, Roy Batty and Drake from Hobo with a Shotgun. I mean he is honestly second to Rami who stole the show. I will now move onto the action and I would not say that there is a ton of action but there is a plethora of drama which keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire season. The cinematography was Superb with every scene being beautifully orchestrated. I will close out by saying this is a Must-Watch show. I mean it delves into very real and precarious situations that we as citizens and people around the world face daily. The fact that technology is going to keep becoming more invasive as time continues is what really makes this new show a contender for one of the greatest shows on network television. I can't wait for Season Two.
