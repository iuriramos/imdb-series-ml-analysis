Well I've just seen one episode of this TV-Show. This show takes us into a controversial world of real problems rather than further away from reality like almost every other thing showing on TV. I really hope they keep push the button on the problems with the big bullshit illusion called the monetary system. I hope every episode will be as good or better as the first one. thanks and peace out // Freedom fighter/keyboard warrior. Revolution is coming! ha ha :) 

I want more TV shows with this concept. this is illustrating the real issues with the world, such as greed, making profits. I want more people engaging with this kind of problems! Stand up for freedom and for justice. Bring down the 1% elite, boarders and dysfunctional laws.
