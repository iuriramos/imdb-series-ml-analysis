Just take V For Vendetta, Fight Club, and the anime Durarara (which is excellent and you should consider watching) and mash em up together PERFECTLY, not some desperate attempt at unoriginal ideas, rather, creating a SUPER idea from all these previous ideas. AMAZING! Everything about it is amazing.

The main character (Elliot) has depression, social anxiety, and lots of mental fun stuff. He is the main reason I love the show. His character, which is filled with bad and negative stuff, tries to do good and save everyone. He is also surprisingly creative and brave, despite his "mental handicaps". 

The story telling & the , sort of, subplots really reminds me of Durarara. There isn't REALLY any subplot, just lots of MAIN PLOTS that overlap each other. But unlike Durarara, the main plots overlap each other because of the main character. I'll quote from the show... "one constant in a sea of variables". The story telling is superb. Well, not exactly story telling... Elliot "narrates" us with a little speech in the beginning of each episode, and every time it's amazing. It gets me hooked up for the rest.

The other characters are also really good, and they get better and better as the show goes on.
