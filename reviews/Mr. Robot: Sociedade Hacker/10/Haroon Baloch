Best Geek cyber drama to date the pilot is beautifully written can't wait to see where the rest of the season goes.Recently i watched Some top rated TV series. Mr. Robot is one of them.

Finally this kind of information is made for mainstream audience. The series goes in details how messed up the world is . how unfair the capitalistic Market-based Debt slavery ,what we call earn money for life is . how the fiat currency is destroying the world as we know it . Such an outdated form of Economic and world Management is wasteful and dangerous.What a refreshing new show!

I like plot resolutions that don't take 5 years to find out. However, sometimes a series has such a great idea that it drags me in like Mr. Robot does.
