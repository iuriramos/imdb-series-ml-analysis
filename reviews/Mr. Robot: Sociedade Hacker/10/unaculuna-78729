these series are just brilliant! the characters from the show surprise the stereotypes of people nowadays. I love the struggle inside Tyrell, he feels it's not natural anymore the things he's chasing for : status, money, ego power, corporation domination. I guess many of us see how we have become and how the world has changed. I HOPE this series show a true solution to fear and dependency from the system. After seeing Mr Robot and some documentaries like" the Corporation", I will never agree to work for a corporation no matter the loss. Before losing money or status or chance to BUY my life,which equals to losing precious time, I want to make sure I live it with dignity, not agreeing to be a slave and help the enslaving of the world.
