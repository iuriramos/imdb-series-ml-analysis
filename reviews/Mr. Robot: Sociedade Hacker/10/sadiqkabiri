I can't wait for this show to start, if it's going to be anything like the first episode, then this thing is going to be my current all time favourites. 

The story was narrated by Rami really well, giving the audience an inside to his social disorder and his performance on the show encapsulated that. I know some of the audience would be lost with TOR, Gnome, KDE, and Linux and all that, but for someone who does find it fascinating (like me) I really appreciated that the director/producer/or whoever didn't create this fake computer operating system just to jazz up what hacking usually looks like, the command line. The story has enough to build on, his social disorder, his vigilante hacking of bad people without remuneration, his social hacking of his friends (Angela being currently the only one) and colleagues to kind of direct them to better choices in the future. 

I really like the way it's filmed and the acting especially by Rami is amazing so I can't wait for episode 2,3,4....etc, etc.
