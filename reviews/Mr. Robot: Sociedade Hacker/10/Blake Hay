Mr. Robot has no rules. It is constantly bringing you things you have never seen before, and that's what makes it so entertaining.

Not only has it got a great story with exceptional actors, but the way they tell the story is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Quite like the TV show Hannibal, Mr. Robot will keep pushing the boundaries of Television, but where Hannibal could sometimes loose it's connection with the audience Mr. Robot never fails to pull you to the edge of your seat in complete anxiety over the characters. It's overall subtleness keeps the fast changing story grounded, making the audience really believe and care about the constant changing of direction the story takes.

It is one of the finest pieces of storytelling to date.
