I knew I wanted to wait till the series finale had aired to write a review about Breaking Bad because I kept holding out to see if the show would surpass its potential like I thought it could. It never quite made it past it's potential, though parts of seasons 2,4 and 5 definitely dabbled in that territory. This is not to say that just living up to the potential isn't a bad thing. Breaking Bad was often a great show and a great story to follow along with. It also boasted two incredible performances from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul throughout. The evolution of the series and of those two characters is something special to watch. The show never quite reaches that next level for one gaping reason, and it's partly because of it's two leads... the shows supporting characters are for the most part boring and irrelevant. When I think of some of the best dramas ever (Justified, Lost, Fringe, Damages, The Wire) the big thing that they possess that Breaking Bad doesn't are relevant characters. It's a lot easier to take your story in lot's of different directions and have relevant sup-plots when they involve characters that grab your attention. Breaking Bad struggled to have that throughout, with key supporting characters Hank, Walt Jr.,Marie, or Skyler (ohhhhh Skyler :S ) providing the spark for any good sub-plots. One great supporting character is Saul, but mainly for his comic relief. Most of Breaking Bad's supporting character's are ones with only a season or two story arc like Gus, Mike, Jane and the Salamanca's. Though the show doesn't quite get to the heights that some of other great dramas, it's still thoroughly entertaining from the opening episode to the satisfying series finale.
