While I was scrolling through the IMDb reviews I found it that there is a lack of reviews that don't worship Breaking Bad. I felt the urge to share my opinion in saying that it isn't as amazing as the whole buzz around it promises. To be fair I binge watched the five seasons in 3 days (I need a life) so maybe my view of the series is different to that of people who waited the weeks for new episodes to air.

The series was really exhausting. The characters turned more evil and their sense of morality degraded as the series continued. This is also a positive point as it shows character development. But the fact that I cared less and less for the characters and therefore for the plot made the series much harder to finish. Only Jesse's breakdown actually got me emotional.

It's also really repetitive. Walt, Jesse and Skyler have a fight. Or someone higher on the crime ladder gets into their business. Eventually it gets fixed at the cost of something.

It was really slow. And I don't mean the episode with the fly! That episode was good. In general the series progresses very slowly. The conversations are also generally uninteresting and boring even when someone is shouting. You have to be quite patient to get through the episode.

But the series is of course not only negatives. It pays close attention to detail and even though it is on the long run quite repetitive, it also has its surprising moments (pizza on the roof anyone?). It isn't as brilliant and perfect as social media shouts but I guess it is one of the better series out there.
