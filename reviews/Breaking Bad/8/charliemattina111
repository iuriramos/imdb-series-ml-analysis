As other reviewers have said, this is a fantastic show, which the awards are evidence of. I watch it every Sunday. However, the story line is too drawn out. I enjoy watching it when it is on, but when it gets to the end, I think to myself "what the hell just happened in that past hour". Of course the writers do this so one watches it next week, and the following week, but I personally think they should give the viewer a little more: A little bit more excitement; a little bit more substance. The show is likely best when watched as a complete season in an afternoon or something. The story line, characters and acting are all great, but the excitement is just not there
