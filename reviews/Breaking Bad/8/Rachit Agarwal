Well the whole thing was very spectacular, the minute details were taken care of. The ending and everything is realistic of what should have happened in real life consequences. The Story revolves around The Crystal Meth and about how a Nobel Prize Winner wasn't given much appreciation later in his life, probably it was his choices. It has always been his choices about everything he did and he really liked it, we can see him singing while enjoying his glorious crimes and concentrating on something which is illegal, his love for his ninety-nine percent blue baby is fascinating, it comes down to crime and Murders and how the things that mattered the most in life were turned up against him, the sudden realization of losing all that he cared for was tempting and making him clear that it was his love for chemistry that didn't changed and so the two years he lived in his tactical Benevolence was way better than his fifty years of Mundane surviving.
