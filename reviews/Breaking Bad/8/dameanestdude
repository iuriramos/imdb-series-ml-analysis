well, I am new to American TV serials. Watching this was tough as the sequences shot are really long and the story moves at a slower pace, but as the serial approaches the final season it just compensates everything... the ending was just fabulous... watch it for its ending, it deserves that...

Every episode starts with a prologue, which actually obliges you to think, and as the story towards the end, they drop a clue for the upcoming serial which again makes you say, DAMN IT, LET ME HIT THE NEXT ONE NOW...

The way they have blended the chemistry aesthetics in the whole plot is really adorable, which is easily understood.

Overall, if u like suspense and those swanky tricks and turns in the story, then this one is for you. But... you've gotta wait for it... ;)
