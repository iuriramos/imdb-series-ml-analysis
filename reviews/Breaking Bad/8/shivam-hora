When i started watching this show i didn't get hooked at once, like i had been by sherlock or by supernatural.. Instead, i hated it. In my opinion the first season was a stretch, long and slow . But little did i know, the story was just getting started.

And from season 2 , to mind-blowing seasons 4 and 5 , this show held the strings of my heart and had me waiting every week with a tub of popcorn and some cola. Even the waiting between two episodes seemed beautiful, it was the time to recall the moments of the last episode and picture the joy in our mind. The series might pick it's pieces up slowly but when it does, your mind will be blown. The story revolves around a chemistry teacher(walter white) in high school who is diagnosed with cancer. And to protect his family's life after him, he starts making meth with his old student(Jesse-Yo) who now deals in drugs. 

I know the idea might not appeal to all but when you see it, you'll have a change of opinions. And in my opinion, Watch it!
