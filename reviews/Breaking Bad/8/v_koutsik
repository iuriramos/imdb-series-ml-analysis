Seasons 1 and 2 are good but it gets really (really) good on season 3. At first i thought that everything will happen very fast and he (the main character) will be king of everything and all. Wrong! the show takes its time and that makes it more realistic about the difficult decisions that must be taken. Most episodes are really "quite" with a hint for next episodes or with one define moment. What i really love is the ironies and how everyone/everything are being connected with the story along the way. Watch it if you like slow, clever, realistic and a little bit hard core movies/series. it's not "Tarantino style" hard core but has its moments!
