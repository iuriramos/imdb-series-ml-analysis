This is a suspenseful TV show with superb acting from Bryan Cranston, from Malcolm in the Middle, and Aaron Paul. The storyline is great because it is all a huge dilemma in the first couple of seasons for Mr. White because on the one hand he must provide for his family, but on the other he knows what he is doing is illegal and he has never broke the law before. In season two though you clearly see the transformation from someone with this dilemma to someone whose a bad ass. Also it has great writing because it incorporates enough comic relief to make the subject less dark and throws in new characters while still making sense. However, seasons two through three are very slow due to necessary character development that builds up to seasons four through five which are phenomenal with an epic ending that will take your breath away.
