Breaking bad is a good show but fails to achieve greatness on multiple levels due to a combination of bad acting, unrealistic writing and lack of grit.

Brysan Cranston plays Walter White who is terminally ill high school chemistry teacher who decides to leave his family with a substantial sum of money to support them in the future by cooking meth. There is no denying that Cranston is fine actor but the supporting cast and where the show gets let down the most. 

The supporting characters do not come across as believable either with their dialogue or actions and sadly their acting is less than desirable. Like so many before it the show strives to show "true" grit but fails like so many American shows, I don't know whether it is the lighting or make up but everything is too shiny and clean and this is a common problem with American shows compared to British shows, which do often capture the rough and crude far better.

Breaking bad is good show but nothing special but worth a watch is nothing else is on.
