After watching the first two seasons when they came out, i lost interest after the abysmal first half of season 3. Fast forward to 2014 and i watched the rest of it to the end. Don't get me wrong. it's a good series, but it's not IMHO worth all the "Best series EVER!"-hype. Plot holes and random events are my main gripe(Plane crash and Jesses gasoline spree are just two of them). Then there is that 3rd season, which is good in the last few episodes but the rest of the season kinda sucks(a whole episode about swatting a fly for example). Season 4 and 5 is very good indeed, lots of tension and good drama. The ending i could see miles away, albeit good but very predictable.

All in all: 8/10
