I had heard a lot about this series, but somehow I found neither time nor ardor for watching it - several seasons, unknown actors to me, ambivalent topic... But recently, thanks to digital media opportunities, I took and watched all seasons in a succession - and I am glad I did so, as abstracts and flashbacks are not of much help if you have missed something, the contents is often sophisticated and versatile.

Season 1 was ambiguous to me, mostly due to the drug issue and the fact that Bryan Cranston reminded me strongly of Cary Oldman whom I like a lot, but then I found me chuckling in many scenes and I realized that I was watching a good black comedy (well, in later seasons, the number of those moments decreased), I got used to the actors and started to like them (particularly Cranston, RJ Mitte, Giancarlo Esposito), paid attention to skillful cinematography, musical background, crazy composition of events and scenes... Moreover, I noticed that the so-called good guys behaved often in an unpleasant manner, and I tend to forget that running drug business in nasty and lethal. I also obtained additional chemistry knowledge but I can promise I will never use it for criminal purposes :) All in all, it is a very good series, although not on my very top where 24, Sherlock Holmes and several Scandinavian crime series are placed. Or perhaps I have not used to the creations were de facto criminals are more pleasant and elaborated than "decent" citizens; but I might change my views as I have begun to watch Dexter...
