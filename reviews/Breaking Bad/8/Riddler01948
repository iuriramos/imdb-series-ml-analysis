Breaking Bad, for a period of time, was my favorite show in the world. I think this was around 2012/2013. After seeing all six seasons (well, all five, five having two parts), I was left annoyed yet as if my expectations had been fulfilled - this is because I both liked and dislike its finale, for various reasons. After watching other shows since then, ones not so similar but similar in terms of reviews, ratings and in general, reception, I now think Breaking Bad is a great show but not the best show ever, as many make it out to be. The acting and writing is, don't get me wrong, amazing, and the show sees an array of very well-portrayed characters. I just don't think it's the single greatest show ever made (sure, it's one of them, but I find shows such as Dexter and The Walking Dead to be a lot better, in different ways.)

I will always like the show though, as it was my favorite for a long period of time a few years back. Particularly, I like Seasons 2, 3 and 4 the most, and would say 2, 3 and 4 are better than 1, 5 and 5 Part II. But they're all good in their own way. And Walter is definitely the best character in the series. Jesse is a good character too - but Walter is the man!

Maybe someday I will change my mind and after watching the series in its entirety for a third time, will reconsider and it could very well become my favorite again... Not that I see that happening any time soon, but it's definitely possible.
