I rated this 8/10 because i genuinely think it could of been better.

I liked it and kept watching it and it was a good series BUT in my personal opinion the ending could of been better..

We don't find out if Gretchen and Elliot ever give Walt Jr the money, we don't know what happens to Jesse after he drives off and I think Walt could of died in a better way too. There was just something missing from the ending that i cant quite put my finger on.

I enjoyed watching the series and will probably watch it again in the future but it is slightly over rated. It needed more action i think, season 4 was my favourite with the story line with Gus and Hank.

Maybe a 1 hour extra episode just to wrap everything up in a nice tidy bow would be good.

Its worth watching though still. 8/10 from me.
