This is such a tough review to write for this show. Much like your emotions as you watch this. Every character has something you root for and something you hate about them. I found myself cheering for Jesse much of the time, but he is a meth junkie and cook. Not the person you generally cheer for. I keep wanting to root for Walt in a weird way, but his evilness is taking him over.

I think the character development is what I really appreciate about this series. Each character has a background that makes the character human and someone you can relate to. I really enjoyed the character background of Gus. He is such an interesting character.

Another thing I really like about the show is each episode has parts that are very funny. Saul is the sleazy lawyer for many of the characters and I laugh each time he is on the screen. Walt's brother in-law (DEA agent) is a trip and just plain funny.

For anyone wishing to start watching here are some suggestions: 1) The concept of a chemistry teacher becoming a drug dealer after getting a cancer scare is a stretch in a way. But the story allows you to make it OK, you just have to keep an open mind. 2) You have to be OK with most of the main characters doing immoral stuff. You have to watch it as entertainment and stay curious how the story lines play out. 3) Put your seat belt on because there are twist throughout the seasons.

When I watch the show, I feel dirty afterwards and feel like it is real life, which means the show makes me feel like I am in each episode.

Overall, a unique show that has not been done before. If you like Lost and the Walking Dead, then you will most likely like this series.
