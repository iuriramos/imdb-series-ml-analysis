The show focuses on Walter White a guy who could afford a much nicer car than the one he drives. He could afford this because he's a successful drug manufacturer. At first he begins this dangerous career to make money to pay for cancer treatment. However somewhere along the way the writers began to lean away from the whole cancer issue. It seems to have disappeared as cases of terminal cancer so often do in reality. Along with the less than desirable vehicle Walt drives is his less than desirable harlot of a wife Skylar. This dried out old box has brought Walter down from one high after another during the course of this unfortunate program. Walt's one friend seems to be a meth addled degenerate wigger named Jesse. In short we have the tale of a guy with way too much money to have such a whore of a wife and a retarded best friend. Bob Odenkirk is awesome in this.
