I watched the whole series within a week or so starting with pilot i just thought it is another overrated series but then i discovered that is the point of it the evolving of the story is so amazing and so real and made think that if i have told that i am going to die what decisions would i make in my life

Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul acting is so striking and they did the job perfectly I have no problem with the ending but i wished it was different i think it could have been stronger I dropped 2 stars because of season one and the first half of season three which were the weakest but apart from that it is one the best TV series i have watched
