Note: This review is about the ending of the show overall, but does not contain content about what happens.

The ending to a show is a lot like a break-up. Nobody wants to get hurt or to hurt the other person (usually) but intentions aside we're human and no breakup is without its scrapes. 

Breaking up with Breaking Bad was devoid of emotion which left me feeling very empty. It's as though a great love had just ended but as you and your beloved parted ways you shook hands, expressed your feelings, and ties up all of the loose ends, never to return and seldom to think about one another again.

The problem is that this is not real, nor is it emotionally satisfying even if it technically satisfies and soothes the burning questions. People - we're not built this way. We not only crave the emotional rollercoasters that relationships and sometimes stories provide, we feed off of it and I'd say we need it. 

Imagine, for a moment, that years later you've found a new woman or man (or TV show) that makes you feel alive. Despite your happiness, would you sometimes think back to that b*tch or b*stard who broke your heart and treated you poorly? Do you even remember the name of anyone you dated with whom you had a "safe" and "tidy" break-up? So it is with stories. We remember the endings and the stories of "The Sopranos" much more poignantly than perhaps we will "Breaking Bad". Vince Gilligan broke our hearts once with the X-Files and the mediocre films that preceded it... I hardly believed we would take him back, that he would then treat us so well, and now am in shock that I believed in the end that it would not feel so empty and bare. Walter White... you are dead to me.
