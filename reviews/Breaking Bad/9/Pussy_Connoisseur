while there are awesome and successful shows like prison break, dexter, and house etc. I've noticed a trend that after around season 4 or 5 and so on. there is the sudden decline in writing and ritualistic storyline to the point of being unavoidably predictable or immensely CONTRIVED. this is where breaking bad stands above the rest.

one thing i didn't quite like was that walter's close relative brother in law just HAD to be D.E.A. that being said, breaking bad is surprisingly filled with ingenious humor and you cant even tell for the most part whether intentional or not...then hits you out of nowhere how serious it can be. the plot twists doesn't feel fabricated and over the top but its in a rather more realistic perspective which works really well.

unique show. continues to be interesting!
