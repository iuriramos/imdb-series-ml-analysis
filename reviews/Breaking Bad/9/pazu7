After Deadwood came to a close I pretty much decided there was no need to keep my television. Only the Dynamic Duo of Stewart and Colbert saved it. Then came Breaking Bad; or what I call 'life after Deadwood'. There is no need for me to wax on about this series. All the fans already know, and anyone with even reasonable taste who happens to stumble across an episode will immediately recognize the quality of the writing, performing, directing, lighting and whatever else it takes to create such a classic series. When I saw first Brian Cranston playing the father I thought the series was doomed. I only knew the guy from Malcolm, where he was entertaining and displayed excellent comic chops but, hey what did I know? I have never been so happy to be revealed as clueless. Cranston is amazing. His metamorphosis from passive aggressive husband/father to hardcore meth God is the meat of the series. But everyone is excellent. My only complaint has been in the last season. The cartel assassins are a little bigger than life, IMO, and it sort of changes the tone of the show. But that's a minor complaint. Others have already written plenty about this show, and much better than I could. So I'll leave the in depth analysis to the pros and close by simply saying 'watch it!'. "Best show on television" is not hyperbole.
