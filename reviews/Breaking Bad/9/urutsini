Disgusting, hyper-realistically gritty, painfully frustrating in that "I don't want to watch but I'll look through my fingers" kinda way . . . yet eminently watchable and extremely funny. I don't know how they get through the situations they do but fate always lends a hand, albeit digging a bigger hole each time.

Every single aspect of this production is a little quirky - plot, script, casting, acting, cinematography, music. Nothing is straight laced which makes it endearing. But that's not likely to be the adjective that comes to mind after the pilot episode . . . think Tarantino does Weeds.

Just remember not to eat anything beforehand.
