This show is plain out memorable and one of the shows that should not be missed. It revolves around greed, revenge and redemption. These elements has been portrayed in other shows before. But not as articulately, intricately and meticulously done as this show (or at least I have seen so far). This show boosted Bryan Cranston career and popularity for good reason. Walter White aka Heisenberg has become one of the most iconic television characters. Some show has a first season that is good and starts to go downhill from there. This is a show that has a good first season and it keeps getting better and better until the grand finale, with a exquisitely stand out ending. It's like Vince Gilligan the creator of the show planned just about the main jist of the story when it comes to the 5 season all out from the beginning. With it's high adrenaline build up that build and builds while staying consistent and relevant through out the whole thing. With the chemistry between characters and transformation, thus the title "Breaking Bad". This is a show I would recommend people to stick through few episodes and there is a high chance that it will hook them. This show is a downright great mix of serious drama and comedy. Overall without giving anything much away, this is a well written show with great character developments that is worth checking out.
