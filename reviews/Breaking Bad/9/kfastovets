Awesome show! what I really like about it is that it really hooks you at the very beginning unlike some other shows that are also good. Like the Sopranos and the Wire for example. I got through the Wire and thought it was very good, but it took a few episodes to get into. 

The Sopranos I didn't really get into after 2 episodes and decided not to watch it. This, though, hooked me with the very first few scenes. 

The acting is superb and the story is wonderfully written. I also love the way the season 2 ended in that it could basically be an ending for the series if only two episodes were going to be there, but it also acts as a good link to more seasons (I think season 3 has already been announced). 

Great Show! Everyone should watch this, except people who can't stand to see the darker sides of life.
