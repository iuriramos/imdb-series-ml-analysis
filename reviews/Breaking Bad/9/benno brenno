Loved every minute of this show. The development of the characters, the acting. All just compelling viewing and believable until season 3's "fly" episode. OMG! What were they thinking? The main guys Walt and Jesse acted out of their characters. Especially, usually smart Walt using a clipboard, a shoe and a mop to kill a fly... in a lab? Then the two start hitting each other that I can only liken to watching Curly and Moe of The Three Stooges. Were the original writers on strike or were they on methampethemine when they made this episode? It was a waste of time and should not have been made and included on the series. I still love this show and will pretend this sorry episode did not happen.
