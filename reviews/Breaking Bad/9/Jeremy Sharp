Cranston's incredible ability to convey frustration, desperation, (and a good few other '-tions' as well) can't help but lead to wonder whether this was a role that was specifically written for him - it's certainly hard to imagine anyone better suited to it. This then, really does become a roller-coaster journey with that lead character and everything that the choices he makes present to him.

With plenty of seat-edge moments crammed into each episode and just enough dry (occasionally dark) humour to take the edge off, Breaking Bad is somewhat of a gem. It's hard not to feel perhaps a little exhausted at the end of each episode (which seem to end as quickly as they start), but with an overwhelming urge to start the next one straight away. Trust me when I say, with 5 seasons to watch you could very easily lose a week or two in one go.
