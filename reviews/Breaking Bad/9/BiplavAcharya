Breaking Bad is one of the best TV series I have watched. I started enjoying the show from it's first episode and enjoyed till the end of it.

It's about drug, about family, about friendship, violence, trade, business, investigation, law and risks and luck. White and Pinkman as partners, is a perfect casting. Hank's satirical and comedy punches are also equally interesting.

Curiosity is always at its peak. I not just felt for the protagonists, but also for wide number of characters. In short, I developed sound rapport with most characters during my watch.

If you are in dilemma, you shouldn't. You will love it, trust me!
