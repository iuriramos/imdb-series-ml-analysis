I felt compelled to write because I really enjoyed breaking bad, not all of it, but it had its thrilling moments, ones really memorable are the turtle scene, bombing Gus and the second encounter with Tuco.

What I really need to say, the fact that Walter is victimizing himself in way that you can relate to is well crafted. He has a grandiosity dementia which is the product of his acute intelligence, yet sometimes, he is sensitive and breakable by the least of emotions. Severe paranoia mixed with psychopathic morale is the actual trade mark of Heisenberg.Creating such a character is really a job well done! We are almost days away of the final 8 episodes, and let me be frank for a moment, the first 8 were not up to par. The absence of a powerful adversary kinda took away the magic of Breaking Bad, Walter is going down, one way or the other, but I hope his fall is going to be as memorable as the fall of Hitler, if you know what I mean.

P.S: Spinning off Saul, eh, fed up with corrupted lawyer drama, I would rather see a crossover between Hannibal and Heisenberg.
