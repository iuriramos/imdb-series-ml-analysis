First of all, I really liked this series, and think the direction and acting was excellent. That said, I must ask "why the hell couldn't they get a native Spanish speaker to play the part of Gustavo Fring?" It is more than apparent that first, he is not a native Spanish speaker, and second, in no way resembles or speaks like a Chilean. I mean, c'mon - some 16% of the population of the U.S. is Hispanic, and in the huge pool of people they couldn't find a good or even great native Spanish- speaking actor, maybe even a Chilean? Even the main chemist in the lab in Mexico did not appear to be Mexican. To name just a few candidates for the Gustavo Fring part known in the U.S.: Edward James Olmos, Jimmy Smits, Andy Garcia, Benicio del Toro, Hector Elizondo, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Raul Julia, etc. Probably any of these very fine actors could have been coached to have a convincing Chilean accent. Héctor Noguera, one of the many fine Chilean actors, could have done the part without breaking a sweat. This is without considering that the character may or may not really have been Chilean, but that's another discussion, and in any case, he was SUPPOSED to have been Chilean, so he could at least speak like one. None of this is to disparage Giancarlo Esposito's work, which wasn't bad, although he only seemed to have a few facial expressions. Perhaps that was what the director wanted, given the character, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt there. In any case, great series.
