One of the best serials i ever seen. Realistic, excellent drama. But the end can be different, in my opinion. All troubles were from Jessie Pinkman and he stay alive. I think Jessie first, who need to be killed there, not Walter. Walter was guilty only in few murders, all the rest were not good persons... At least, Creators of this work, can show us. What happens with money, which Walter leave for his family? What happens with Jessie?Anyway its been amazing work. The first episode was very good and memorable. The scenes with violence were very realistic and detailed. In the same time it was not like just a simple action movie. Inner feelings of the heroes were great, how they show their stresses,emotions.
