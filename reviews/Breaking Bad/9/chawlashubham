Protagonist turns antagonist! The show starts off at a low pace in the first season. Most people might get bored and never watch further. But that's where you need to have a little patience. The story takes a dive into "keeping you glued" phase after that. Initially, Walt seems to be a lovable character. All his actions seem justified. Anything and everything for a family. But you are in for a little surprise there, later in the series.According to me, Jesse Pinkman is the BEST character of the series. Top notch acting, perfect portrayal of such a role requires a lot. Many of you might hate the character Skyler White from midway of the 3rd season, but she was always right! Till the end of 4th season Walt does everything possible to save himself and his family from Gustavo fring, the primary villain until then. But from 5th season on wards, I started to develop a certain sense of hatred for Walt. I mean you cant do anything for the sake of family. Greed, ego, too much family oriented reasons may make you hate him. He did everything for family only, accepted, but the level to which he drops is just not right. When he poisons Brock, he gets Hank killed and adding to that he lies with a straight face. No guilt. No regret. But Bryan Cranston's act was amazing. He is the perfect guy for this role. While approaching the end of the show, I wished that Walt shouldn't live, but it seemed otherwise from earlier episodes of season 5, but when Walt dies at the end(it was actually unclear as they just show his body on the ground with camera zooming out, so i presumed he died) a sense of relief overwhelmed me! He deserved to die. Jesse Pinkman was the main protagonist throughout the series for me. It was a bummer he didn't get as much attention on his personal life in the show as much as Walt did. All in all a tremendous show, which could've been a 10/10 if I hadn't started hating Walter White. Things we do for the FAMILY!!!
