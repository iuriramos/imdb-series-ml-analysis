Breaking Bad is one of the most addictive shows out there. I started watching with a little bit of skepticism but it proved me wrong very quickly. 

Throughout the shows duration I have never seen a character transformation like the one Walter White undergoes throughout his various experiences. I'd always pictured Bryan Cranston as a "nerdier" actor however, this series completely changed my view of him.

By far one of the greatest modern shows. It has it all from action, suspense,comedy etc... 

Definitely worth a watch!
