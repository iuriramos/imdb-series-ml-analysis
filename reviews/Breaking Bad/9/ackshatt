Breaking Bad is iconic in the way it altered the lead character Walter White (played excellently by Bryan Cranston) in appearance, both physically and metaphysically. Jesse Pinkman (played as unreliably as the character itself by Aaron Paul) lends himself to Walter's increasingly atrocious plans with the zeal "totally" becoming of a drug user. Giancarlo Esposito deserves the next mention for pulling off the hidden-behind-pastel-shades evil character with aplomb. The cast is exceptionally talented and the performances match up to their status, if not elevate it. Directors from Mad Men etc. give certain episodes their own spin, sometimes literally, and point-of-views and tracking shots complement the excellent cinematography, making full use of the dreary, dry, impersonal setting of the desert.

As for the story, watch it! :) I personally fast-forward through Skyler/Marie sister talks, but that's just my anxiety to see the action ASAP. I have ticked the "Contains spoilers" button just so first-time viewers may watch without preconceived notions, as that sets up the plot twists and random coincidences very well.
