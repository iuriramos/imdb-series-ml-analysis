Breaking Bad is breaking whatever limit there is for breaking the limits on television! And that, it is certainly the best when it comes to being the most bad-ass show there was/is/will be on television! I am a bit late to review this title but I started watching it just about last month and it is so addictive that it has had me hooked onto it until I craved for more... Breaking Bad is a journey of a certain Walter White, an underachieving man, a man way too qualified for the job he does, the wages he earns, a man barely able to provide for his family which he loves more than himself is left with no option when he understands that he has cancer and little time on his hands; to choose the path that seems impossible for him- a timid, meek guy....a path were red is shed for green...lives are put at risk on a daily basis. He takes on the role of a manufacturer of crystal meth along with Jesse Pinkman a former student of his, who is a small time drug dealer! And he chose to break bad!! I'd rate it 10/10 A Must Watch for anyone who has eyes!! In Jesse's words: IT IS THE BOMB, BIATCH!!
