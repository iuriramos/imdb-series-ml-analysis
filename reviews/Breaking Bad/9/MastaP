To begin, I binged watched this show badly from start to end. I got to watch the series finale live and I'm thankful I did. I don't think my mouth dropped has many times watching this show than it did for anything else my whole entire life. Just the drama, crime, and pure awesomeness of the entire show brings a incredible connection with the viewers. For example, I like this show so much that when someone asks me "What's your favorite TV show?", automatically without thinking Breaking Bad pops into my head and out my mouth. This show has brought me to love and appreciate dramas and thrillers. 

Not only the plot brought me to adore this show, but the characters and setting has well. Another example, Bryan Cranston aka Walter White (hope you knew that) is in a new movie or show, I suddenly have a interest and attraction for that film. Just the characters emotions and passion in the series is breath-taking. From Anna Gunn to Bob Odenkirk, the appreciation I have towards their hard-work and commitment is unimaginable. The setting is also perfect for the show. I seriously want to visit Albuquerque, New Mexico now. From the car wash to the school, much pleasure comes out in seeing how nicely they fit in with the rest of the show.

This is my first review for IMDb and I'm glad to do on something I love to watch. I am not a critic nor blogger, simply a dedicated fan. Yes, there are some few things I would of liked to go differently, but with television you cannot please everyone. I just want to give a shoutout to Mr.Gilligan for a spectacular job on an amazing piece of work. Thank you for reading my review and thank you Breaking Bad! Hope on seeing that spin-off soon!
