I can't get myself to give anything above a 9/10 on anything, because I believe that means it's got to be absolutely perfect, however in a way I feel this show deserves that.

I will not to go into detail, but seeing a high school chemistry teacher, Walter White (played by the brilliant Bryan Cranston) manufacture crystal methamphetamine to pay for his medical bills and provide for his family when he's gone is obviously a very intriguing plot. Added to that you have terrific writing, brilliant character development and a good supporting cast.

Yes it does get very violent at times, and Aaron Paul's character can be very annoying, but I believe this is how the writers intended it to be, and with 2 Golden Globes, another 114 awards and 192 nominations, there's very little to argue about. Not surprised that Bob Odenkirk's character, Saul Goodman got his own spin-off show titled "Better Call Saul", that would be interesting to watch.
