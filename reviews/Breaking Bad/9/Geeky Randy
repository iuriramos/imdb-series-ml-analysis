Non-stop adrenalin-rush crime-drama following the story of Albuquerque chemistry teacher Cranston turning into a methamphetamine kingpin in order to secure his family's finances after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, calling upon ex-student Paul to assist in the streetwise aspect of the drug business. Cranston is perfect in one of the most mind-blowing hero-to-villain transformations, backed by unforgettable recurring characters like Saul Goodman (played by Bob Odenkirk), Gustavo "Gus" Fring (played by Giancarlo Esposito), Mike Ehrmantraut (played by Jonathan Banks), Todd Alquist (played by Jesse Plemons), Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (played by Laura Fraser), Gale Boetticher (played by David Costabile), Victor (played by Jeremiah Bitsui) and the Salamanca Family (played by Mark Margolis, Raymond Cruz, and twins Daniel and Luis Moncada). Unfortunately, the major supporting roles played by Paul, Gunn, Norris, Mitte, Brandt and Quezada all take their turns at being incredibly annoying or ridiculously codependent on the despicable main character. The show's intensity ends up overshadowing some great themes and symbols involving moral consequences and family devotion. Also, for such a nail-biting show, the ante isn't actually raised all that much in hindsight. Still, and most importantly, it's an overall excellent showactually one of the few series that literally gets better and better as it progresses. High recommended.
