It's already been said many times, but this show is great. Well written, great acting, good story line. However, I find it very predictable, and therefore it doesn't get me as hooked as I was with Lost or Prisonbreak. For example (saw this today), the shoe that gets stuck on the ceiling lamp when Walt is trying to catch a fly. But it also happens with the more important things, it's just not that exciting, but just perfect drama. Also small details are not explained (which is perfectly done in Lost...) . For example the green stuff Walter Junior sees on the fridge, which came from Skylar's face. He sees it, but his thought or reaction about it is never revealed. Will keep watching till the end though (currently in season 3) :-)

It's 2,5 months later now and I have finished the show, and therefore I must edit my review... Wow it really got better in season 4!! Much more exciting, really really loved it till the end! Sorry if I ever made anyone doubt to watch it, with my previous comments, really gotta watch this show! <3
