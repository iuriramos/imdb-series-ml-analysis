I was skeptical at first as I don't typically go in for what others consider "all the rage" of the moment. But since I enjoy shows like The Sopranos, The Wire, etc. I thought I would give it a whirl. Right from the beginning I was hooked. Great characters, fantastic acting, and top notch writing all combine for an amazing series from beginning to end. It's not all 100% perfect but somehow that is even better than if it were perfect. Sort of like looking at an air-brushed photo of a supermodel...it just ain't real. This series, my friends shows what television can accomplish through great story-telling and edge-of-your-seat presentation. I will be following the careers of those who are behind the making of this fine series with great interest.
