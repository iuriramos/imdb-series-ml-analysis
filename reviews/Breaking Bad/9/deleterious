Few times I've become addicted to a TV series. I started with Breaking Bad just randomly, and I don't regret it. Just watch the first episode and you will know what I mean.

Although the main subject may be a little bit unpopular for wide audiences and perhaps unsuited to kids and youngsters, I would recommend this show for the rest of us. The story goes about an underachieved high-school chemistry teacher and family dad, that one day is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Since then, he will try to gather as much money as possible to sustain his family for whenever he is gone and to pay his cancer treatment. He finds a gold mine when he applies his knowledge to the meth business (chemistry freaks may enjoy the technical stuff in the episodes), and he finds himself and his business partner in a number of kafkian situations that will keep the audience tied to their sits. 

Cranson and the rest of the cast make a hell of a performance (note: Cranson got 2 consecutive emmys for the leading drama role beating Dr. House and the Lost guy). In my opinion, special mentions are also due to Hank, the DEA officer, and Saul, the attorney; they make outstanding performances in their secondary roles.

All in all this is a TV series with a very fine balance between suspense, drama and even some comedy, with an original plot and with an outstanding crew.
