Here's a TV series I almost skipped, coz on paper it just didn't seem that interesting to me. I eventually I gave it a chance, and I'm sure glad I did. Although there were some quality dips during the run of the series it certainly has earned it's place as one of the most memorable series of all time. They were wise enough to create a 5 season story arc and give the characters a chance to come full circle. Maybe they've stopped at the height of their success, but it's a hell of a lot better then keep milking it season after season until it has bled dry like some other series did. Some people apparently were disappointed with the ending but I don't agree. Maybe people had such high expectations nobody was ever going to be able to match them. Following the 'bad guy' for 62 episodes was incredible fun and very addictive. If you haven't seen Breaking Bad (who hasn't?), give it a chance. You won't regret it!
