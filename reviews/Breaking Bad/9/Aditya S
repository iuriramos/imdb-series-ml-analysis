It is the best TV-series I have ever seen. The performance of the cast and the direction is just so amazing that u will never know what to expect. The jokes are funny. Over all The series is very entertaining and you cannot stay without talking about it. It keeps you guessing till the end and most of the people including me didn't know what would come.

I loved this series the first time I watched it, now i've seen it more than 3 times and i still love it and want to watch it. The music was also good and the acting was the best. A must watch series!!!!

i m eagerly waiting for fresh episodes, yet to release in march 2013 i feel very bad when i can not get this series very easily in India.. but after all i feel very happy to enjoy show.
