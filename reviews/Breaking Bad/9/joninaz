I was late to the game... kept hearing good things but never saw it. Finally I decided to dedicate some time, but I'm not one to jump into a story mid-stream.

Therefore I sought out Season One, Episode One, so I could begin at the beginning. You have to do the same if in a similar situation. The genius of the series is character progression, so you can't be random in when you start watching. The evolution of the people and their interwoven stories is the core of the series.

After the first few episodes, I was consumed in watching every show in order, as quickly as I could. It's simply brilliant.

Rather than re-hash the details, all I can say is it's worth the journey. The concept is wild, some of the characters can be annoying, and a lot of people will find holes in the storyline. Here's my reply: It's smarter than everyone watching. The writers are 10 steps ahead of you. You will be challenged, shocked, confused and irritated on a number of levels.

And that's why it is genius.
