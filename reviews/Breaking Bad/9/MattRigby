For any body that hasn't watched Breaking Bad I can tell you that it is a absolute master piece and must be viewed. At the Heart of the story is Walter White(Bryan Cranston) that plays a terminally ill chemistry teacher that cruelly persuades a drug addict Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to produce crystal meth in order to provide a stable future for his family. But this cruel persuasive side of Walter is a drop in the ocean as he becomes increasingly unstable and applies his wonderful mind to a much darker way of life. Bryan Cranston blew me away when I saw how comfortable he looked in this role. Of course we all know him from Malcom in the Middle and I think that was why it was so unexpected. However, despite Bryan Cranston's fantastic performance I must say the star of the show for me was Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) who displayed incredibly vivid and heartfelt acting throughout the series. From the strongest hate and desperation to the saddest and loneliest emotions that one just lay mesmerised in front of the television. As the first episode begins we are hurled into the craziest of scenes that one cant help their curiosity be captured . Each episode evokes countless reasons to continue watching and your totally at the mercy of small build ups and mini climaxes that I consider to be a genius bit of television. Throughout Walters journey we see him make some terrible and devastating decisions but we somehow understand and almost justify his reasoning . The whole cast play their roles superbly and contribute to the realisation of how mysterious and disconcerting Walters world has become. As the series draws to a close we see all of the characters in a very desperate place and we find ourselves gripped and stuck to our seats once again.

9.5/10
