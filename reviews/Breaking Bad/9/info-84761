I will admit when I was first introduced to this show I did not think I could get into it but when you give it a shot and watch through the whole first 3 episodes your hooked onwards to see the roller coaster ride that unfolds for Mr. Walter White. Many times throughout the show you "think" you know what's about to happen but things take a split second turn. I was satisfied with the ending but would have been more stoked to see how one other character that drives away ended up. I wont give away who it is but it would have been gratifying to see how his life turned out since we saw how his partner ended up. Or at least have seen what was next for him. Either way the best show I have seen in my life. It's basically an extremely long movie thats about the best way to put it.
