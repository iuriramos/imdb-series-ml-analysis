It may have been an overrated TV series, but it's overrated for a reason. It's just that good for what you can watch on Basic Cable at the time. Each episode of Breaking Bad is filled with great dialogue, character development, intriguing plot lines, and sprinkles of humor here and there. It's jam-packed with content on expert story telling.

The story of Breaking Bad follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an overqualified Chemistry teacher at a high school at a part-time car wash worker in Albuquerque, New Mexico. After being diagnosed with lung cancer, he uses his chemistry knowledge to manufacture methamphetamine by partnering up with former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). Right here is where the fun of the show us. We watch episode after episode of a highly educated man with a kid who only knows street smarts interact with each other and develop a bond while struggling with their lives. It's a complex relationship that the two characters but you will totally get invested in it.

Other points I would like to make is that there is a good amount of scientific accuracy in Breaking Bad to the point where you might get a little educated watching this. This is also one huge character study regarding Walter White. We see an under-appreciated man become someone huge and that causes a building of a huge ego that will eventually wreck havoc. In fact, think of Walter White as a sociopath in the making. A law-abiding citizen becoming the biggest and smartest criminal you could imagine. Show Creator Vince Gilligan said that this show is about "the protagonist becoming the antagonist".

You get five whole seasons of amazing storytelling if you watch this.
