There's honestly too much to talk about when it comes to pointing out the great things about Breaking Bad, but the thing that mainly stood out, for me, were the character relationships. They were so well-defined, and I mean every one of them. You could feel respect between characters, hatred, fear and love. Of course, the one that stands out is Walt and Jesse. Never before has there been such an unpredictable, volatile and constantly shifting relationship in any sort of media. 

The actors who portay them add so much to that equation, of course, from Dean Norris to RJ Mitte to the great Jonathan Banks and the stellar Anna Gunn, but there's those two performances that rise above the rest. Aaron Paul is Jesse. The childish tendencies and bitter self-loathing that Paul brings to the character, among other things, is truly impressive. But then there's Bryan Cranston. Dear God. It almost goes without saying, but his is some of the best acting ever. His transformation from hen-pecked nerd to intensely intimidating monster is just awe-inspiring.

One of the best shows to ever grace the small screen, I'm glad I finally caught it and will probably be kicking myself for the next few weeks for putting it off for so long.
