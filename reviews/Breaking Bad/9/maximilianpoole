This is a fantastic series and if you give it 3 episodes you'll be addicted. The changes within the characters throughout the series' is brilliant but myself I found the ending incredibly predictable and disappointing. This is what stopped it getting a 10/10 from me. The tension and cliffhangers leave you wanting more and I myself spent 3 weeks watching the episodes back to back between working. This programme doesn't really have a target audience because everything about it is so good. Basically if you're not into it after 3 episodes stop watching. Second only to my number 2 GOT (but you have to like the genre) and my number 1 'The Shield' which has numerous themes used in Breaking BAd.
