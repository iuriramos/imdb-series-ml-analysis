My Rating: 9.7/10... Even though this is one of the greatest shows I think that there isn't any show/movie/game that deserves a 10/10 even if it's my favorite, and that goes for this show.

This show has the most emotional feeling that I have seen in probably ever. It shows that bad things can happen to anyone no matter who they are. This show is artistically beautiful, and is nothing short of the greatest show I have ever watched. Now it took me awhile to get around to this show, but what I have to say is, after watching this, the other AMC hit "The Walking Dead" was nothing really but a basic show to me even though it's still a great show. It the perfect blend of everything a show needs to survive. I highly recommend this show to anyone willing to watch it, and anyone that doesn't.
