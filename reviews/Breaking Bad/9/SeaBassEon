I just finished watching all 4 seasons in just under 3 days. I was totally addicted at first, somewhat lost my enthusiasm during the 3rd season, and regained it with the fabulous 4th season.

The writing is of the highest quality and the acting is exceptional. Bryan Cranston(Walter) and Anna Gunn(Skyler) are amazing. A special mention to Giancarlo Esposito(Gus) for one of the creepiest TV character ever.

It's nice that there is a main storyline linking all the seasons together. The main quest remains the same, and all the subplots revolve around it. Something Tim Kring was not able to do with Heroes for example.

The only critics I have (and it is the only one really, otherwise I would rate it 10/10) is that I found some of Walter's decisions rather foolish and hard to justify. Also, in a few episodes, montage was weak and didn't contribute to a satisfying pace.

I am now hooked on this series and can't wait to get my next fix in 2012 with season 5.
