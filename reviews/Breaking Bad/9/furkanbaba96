Firts off all actors from this series is making their job amazing.Especially Walter white(Bryan Cranston) make this series special.

The negative part of this series is sometimes you can get bored easily because The theme is always same.And sometimes you think that can a man do all of it? And that make this series far away from realism. And if you make Show that has been improved from a realist theme you should keep on doing it. or else it makes people who watches it sick.But if you making this for money you are right Because nobody wants to see something ordinary.But still better than all the other crazy staff

This is unique show that you never watch equal. 9/10 Ä°f you still haven't started you miss a lot...
