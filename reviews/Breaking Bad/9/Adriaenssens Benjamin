Breaking bad is one of the best series i have seen so far. I have watched the full 3 series and i like the way they combined the world of chemistry with the world off drugs. All the 3 series were good in my opinion. The episodes give you also a good view on how the world with chemistry and drugs is related.

It's about the story of Walt. He's a high school chemistry teacher. He is married and has a son (who has palsy) and a baby on the way. He also works part time at a car wash to earn an extra few bucks, but he and his family still are not doing well financially. One day he gets diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, what means he can't live much longer. But instead of dealing with it (for example, going to a therapist or talking about it with his wife, whom he doesn't tell), he quits his work at the car wash and start thinking about making drugs to earn enough money to provide he's family a good and easy live without troubles after his death. Later on, he finds out a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman is a dealer. And they make a deal: Walt uses his chemistry background to create the Meth while Pinkman uses his connections to sell it. But Walt didn't know the drug world was that hard, and even if you make good Meth, you will not be rewarded with lots of money, because the problem is you can't sell it in large amounts but only to the local drug users. Walt wants more and wants to work for big companies. But the problem is where do you find them, and who can you trust in the drugs world? If you want to find out, and watch an incredible good story line. Then you definitely have to watch Breaking Bad.
