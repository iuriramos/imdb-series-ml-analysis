I can't stop myself watching this movie till end.In short it is a nice movie.Naturalization is very fine as well as characters.It is different form the past stories.a struggling high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer at the beginning of the series.He turns to a life of crime,producing and selling something with a former student.This is all for creating a nice situation inside the movie.The viewers will never get bored.it is difficult to write for Walter White because the character is so dark and morally questionable.Another nice thriller is that Walter's wife who was pregnant with their second child prior to his diagnosis,and who becomes increasingly suspicious of her husband after he begins behaving in unfamiliar ways.nice to watch movie.
