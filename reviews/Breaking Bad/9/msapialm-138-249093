The only star lacking in my rating is due to the slow parts in the White family & household scenes. I found myself thinking " get on with it!", then I started to just fast-forward thru that. Otherwise, just great writing. Usually I find something implausible but Mr Gilligan did a great job. The X-files never really caught my attention but now I'll have to start watching that show. Great casting as well. At first, I couldn't stop thinking about Bryan Cranston as the goofy dad in "Malcom in the middle" or as the converted dentist in Sienfeld but before I realized it Cranston was & always be Mr White... until the next great role he plays.
