i give a 9 not a 10 simply because we need to hold our breaths for most part of the show..the lighter moments do not contain much wit and humor.The show pretty much reflects reality in terms of Walter's cancer,so you cannot experience immense joy or laughter watching that family..and his wife is also the type of person who's concerned with every little details of her husband's life and very curious when she feels the husband's hiding something..the plot is great,the storyline is great..but,you won't laugh or even smile much during the show even when it's a little bit slow..so prepare to acknowledge the reality what any serious sickness can do to you...
