"Breaking Bad" It starts with Walter White who knew that Crystal Meth is famous in Albuquerque. He got cancer and he starts making meth with Jesse Pinkman so that when he died he got enough money so his family can survive. It's first season is interesting. My favorite part was when Walter goes to Tuco because Tuco has taken his meth and beat Jesse. I enjoyed the first season. Second and Third season of Breaking Bad is too slow. I get bored watching these episodes. After Hank, Walter's brother-in-law shot Tuco, it get pretty much depressing. Meanwhile, Walter start business with Gustavo Fring who's having very vast meth business. It's get interesting in very end of third season. Fourth and Last Season of Breaking Bad is very interesting. How Walter White take out revenge on Gustavo Fring? How Gustavo killed his old enemy? After killing Gustavo, Walter become king of meth empire. When Hank knows about Walter White in second half of last season, he tries to take down Walter with Jesse Pinkman. Unfortunately Hank was killed by gang who before works for Walter White. They take all of the Walter's money(about 80 million$) and take Jesse as a prisoner. They tortured Jesse and forces him to make meth for them. Here, everyone knows about Walter and his business. Walter decides to came back when Elliot and Gretchen said about Walter White on TV. Walter asks them to gave money to his son on his 18th birthday. In the end, he killed everyone who was with him in meth business, except Jesse and Saul Goodman. He asks Jesse to ran away as he himself get shot. A little disappointment for me is Jesse should also be killed. Some of the dialogs of Breaking Bad are becomes famous like, "I am not in danger, I am the danger", " I am the on who knocks", " Let's say I know a man, who knows a man, who knows another man who can get through your work". It was a brilliant show. I liked it.
