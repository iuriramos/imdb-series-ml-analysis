Since you are checking out Breaking Bad on IMDb, you already know this show so you are probably hooked on it as well as I am. For those still doubting when to start watching it, make it a top priority! Leave the groceries in the hallway, the goldfish can go on a diet, leave it all and go watch. It really is as good as everybody says it is. All the actors give Oscar-worthy performances, but you can tell the crew is giving their best as well. The interiors of the houses feel very real, whether it is the house of a drug addict or a middle-income family. I want to commend the casting agency for all the right picks, and the writers for developing believable story lines and making all the pieces fit even after five seasons. The actors also deserve a compliment for showing all aspects of their character's grief, including showing them on their most vulnerable and ugly moments.
