The summary says it all. This show is just too perfect to summarise. With the amazing acting, perfect cast and quite frankly epic moments this show truly lives up to the hype.

However, what really makes this show "click" is the realism it entails. It's been the strategy of most shows (dexter, suits etc) to simply use a character and throw them at us as whatever character they need to be at that time with no reasoning, e.g deb is angry because she's deb. This is something that Vince bypasses all together with his incredible use of character development, and example of which can be seen when we consider Walt and Jesse, Walt always described chemistry as "the study of change" and wow how they both change, with Walt's decent and Jesse's growth it's hard not to appreciate Vince's skill when it comes the character development which I believe simply makes the show shine. 

P.S sorry for the Incompetence of this review. Obviously this is the first I've ever done and I need allot more practise... :P
