Breaking Bad The TV series "Breaking Bad", created by Vince Gilligan, is about the chemistry teacher Walter White (Bryan Cranston) who contracted cancer. Knowing that he would leave his wife and his children behind with a huge mountain of debts, he decided to get on the business of meth cooking. Together with his partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), they get into lots of trouble that come to a head when Walter's brother-in-law, the DEA-agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), finds out their second identity. I usually prefer other types of series like HIMYM and others. But when I started with the first episode, it immediately attracted me in a way that I always had to watch the following episode. It might seems that there are some repetitive moments, but it's still great to see how they solve all these problems and how much expression the actors can bring into all the different scenes.
