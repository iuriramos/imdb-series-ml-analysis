When I rate films or shows on IMDb I rate them on what I think they should be.

My sister got my entire family into Breaking Bad and now I'm hooked on it and I'm only 13!! I have to admit I thought this was highly over rated when I watched the first 2 or 3 episodes, but it takes time for you to get into the characters, and after I did that it was absolutely brilliant!!! I am at the end of S4 and I am extremely enjoying it. Walt/Bryan Cranston plays a PHD Chemistry teacher at a high school and teams up with former student Jesse/Aaron Paul and start to cook meth for his family to get money as he has terminal lung cancer. And that is all I can tell you to be honest!!

Breaking Bad=9/10
