I was first skeptical about this show to be honest. But im glad I gave it a shot when I had the chance. The show revolves around the main protagonist of the series Walt, who finds out he is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. In efforts to leave his wife and handicapped son with the best future financially, he partners up with a fromal student of his, Jesse to cook and distribute meth and other drugs around the area. The show does not cease to disappoint its audience by leaving viewers with the anticipation to watch more.Walt, usually finds himself in hot water throughout the show keeping the audience attracted. Walt and jesse constantly are plaqued with the troubles and hardships it truly is to be a successful drug dealer, which is what truly keeps the show running. The bigger question is will Walt be successful in his illicit and controversial efforts, or will he end up regreting this decision? The show ties in self morals and provocative questions that can lead many people in the audience questions about themselves. Give this show a try.....u wont be disappointed.
