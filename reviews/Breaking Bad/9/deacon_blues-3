Breaking Bad may just be the best thing I have ever seen on TV. 

Brian Cranston and Aaron Paul are magnificent as two characters almost everyone finds interesting. 

I started watching this thing in a very unsympathetic mood, but the premise interested me.

Once I got through about episode #3, though, I was continually amazed at the way the story grabbed on to me and just would not let go. 

All the supporting cast members are also superb, especially Anna Gunn and Dean Norris, who are like the two gatekeepers of WW's life, one from the legal side, the other from the family side. 

I think the main appeal of this show is how WW keeps coping and over achieving in his new choice of vocation. He is at the same time the most unlikely drug lord and the most brilliant manipulator of those around him. It's just amazing to watch all the machinations he comes up with to stay on his game when you don't think he has a chance of surviving. 

Special kudos for RJ Mitte as Walter Jr.--he is a fascinating character; both sympathetic and assertive. 

Walter can be such a jerk, but you just keep rooting for him, warts and all. He's the ultimate underdog of TV drama characters. And America loves an underdog, don't we?
