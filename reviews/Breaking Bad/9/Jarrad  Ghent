Breaking Bad was and still is the best TV Show and I just love it. I might be a guy who really doesn't care about shows that get talked about a lot. So when I was recommended the show I was like OK fine. The pilot episode got hooked I'm in. I wanted to see where these characters go; I wanted to see the ideas and plot twist and turns. The show is just so good, by the end of the show in season 5 episode 15 I'm really happy. 

OK... I think you know what I think of this show it is just so good. I want to explain what makes this show so great. Walter White is the best portages of the show he goes through a transformation into a villain. Brain Cranston is one of the best actors in the show if the best. Jesse Pinkmen is a great character; he was broken by the end. He changed massively and for the entertainment of us. This show featured some of TV's greatest villains like Taco, the twins, Uncle Jack and of course Gustavo Fring. Hank is a great character too; he fits the cop kind of character.

This Show was also trying to teach us something about the drug life. If you become a Meth dealer you could lose your family, friends and your life. I believe that we must realize that drug dealing is wrong.

The dialog really is great with some emotional, depth and humor. I'm never bored by the dialog scenes because it's needed for the rest of the story. 

This show is a drama and it's thick, Even though it has it funny moments. Every season is darker then the last and that's why the 5th season was that depressing. Sometime Walter White does things which make you go he wouldn't do that in season 1. Oh yeah... Skyler is bitch.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad is a masterpiece and it will be remembered. So hail to the king. And thank you ever much for reading, Goodbye.
