It's my first review so i will not talk much , if you like good criminal this show is for you :) Episode by episode Walther becomes really really good :) Every episode i got chills and enjoyed it ... I don't really know what else i can say :) This show is very good , today's television needs more shows like this one :) Preview: 1.Good 2.Very Good 3.Intense episodes 4.Good story 5.Great characters 6.Rate speaks for itself 7.Very very good show!The series starts off a bit slow after the first couple of episodes but then takes off from there. This show was very well written and one of those shows in which I had to watch the new episode right away. I actually watched this series twice and was just as good the second time around.
