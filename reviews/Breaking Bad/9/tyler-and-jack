Everyone knows about Breaking Bad by now. Everyone. So there's no point in writing a review.

But I've always done things that were quite pointless, so it's no problem.

Bryan Cranston plays Walter White, the Chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with cancer in the first episode. To cover his medical bills, and leave enough money for his family, he decides to cook up some fine drugs, with the help of an ex-student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). As his new career takes him further and further into the world of crime he struggles to keep things secret from his wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), his son, Walter Jr (RJ Mitte), and his brother-in-law, Hank (Dean Norris), who also happens to be a damn fine member of the DEA.

I, like a lot of people, came late to the Breaking Bad party. I heard people raving about the final season and I played catch up on Netflix. It was well worth it.

Although never JUST pandering to audiences, Vince Gilligan has crafted a satisfying, rich, entertaining show that stands as some of the best TV ever.

Cranston and Paul are the heart of the show, with both never EVER being less than superb. Seeing White get colder and colder is fantastic stuff, but seeing Pinkman get smarter is equally rewarding. Gunn and Mitte are both wonderful, Norris ALMOST steals the show, and Betsy Brandt is great fun as Skyler's sister, Marie. Bob Odenkirk, Steven Michael Quezada, Jonathan Banks, Giancarlo Esposito, Jesse Plemons, Charles Baker, etc. are also all fantastic. I feel bad for missing anyone out, but I can't just list the entire cast.

It's a slow burner, with the first couple of seasons quite frustrating for those who have a clue as to where the story is going, but that just makes the overall arc of the show, and that final season, all the more rewarding for patient viewers.

Just watch it. Watch it all ASAP.
