An excellent series, I came here to advise all fans of good series and good actors, to attend this magnificent series, because this series is certainly marked by that. One of my main reasons for writing this is to thank all actors present in this series, that have done a great job, they are great professionals, thanks for the times provided. Bryan Cranston, was a phenomenal actor, that changes is personality from one moment to another, unfortunately haven't seen in other works, but surely i will look for him from now on. The most shocking, and perfectly executed scenes, are the one's with the famous Jesse Pinkman showing the life of an addicted, that surely is very compelling to see. I also want to give here my congratulations to the actor RJ Mitte still, that made a magnificent role, surprised me, and he is clearly a kid who we really like, trought out the series. Anna Gunn is the most sensual of all, the sexiest, unpredictable and the most brilliant women have seen, loved the actress. The ending part is excellent, because it is not the typical happy ending, and that pleases me very much, it needs to have a great message to do, and execute something like that. Thank you all.
