Unforgettable, an instant classic, Breaking Bad delivers in every department.

It's such a joy to escape and delve into Walter Whites world, escaping your own for a while.

Sublimely written, an amazing plot that unfolds perfectly and leaves you wanting and waiting for more, Cranston brings Walter to life so much so you get pulled in and absorb everything, but hats off to many of the cast especially Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk and Anna Gunn.

Annas character Skyler was also amazing, I found myself hating Skyler which just lends and validates Annas skill set as an actress.

What an incredible show Breaking Bad is, it has raised the bar and left me saddened it's over.
