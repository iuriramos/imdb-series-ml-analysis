Have you ever experienced a life changing event which has turned your complete world upside down. I can't say I have, but I know someone who has. His name is Walter White: Loving father, true husband, dedicated chemistry teacher, crystal meth master chef. "Wait a second!" you think. Something in that sentence didn't fit in. You're damn right it didn't, and that's what makes Breaking Bad fit in perfectly in the series hall of fame! 

50 year old Walter White has a teenage son with cerebral palsy, trying his best to fit in, and a pregnant wife not afraid to speak her mind. When Walter learns that he has lung cancer and probably hasn't got very long to live, he decides that he must do Whatever IT Takes to secure the future of his family. As far as I am concerned, producing crystal meth serves perfectly well as the IT and Walter seems to share my view on that. He's got the brains, he knows the chemistry but lacks the street experience. Better gain some.

Breaking Bad is all about conflicting opposites with an antihero leading the way by erasing the fine line between right and wrong, good and bad. How long can you keep keep a double life double? How much bad is acceptable in the attempts to achieve something good? There are many questions to answer, but there are no clear answers to be found. Once the iron chains of the law have been broken there ain't no easy way to mend them again, unless you want to play the part of the missing link. Walter sure doesn't and is driven further and further down the path he has chosen, transforming into someone no-one had expected. As long as I can be the spectator watching from the other side of the screen I'll cheer it all on with eyes big as steering wheels screaming: "Break that law! Break it bad!"

Oh, did I mention that Walter's brother-in-law works for the drug enforcement administration?
