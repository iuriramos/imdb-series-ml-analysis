When straight-laced high school chemistry teacher Walter White is diagnosed with cancer, he turns to cooking meth hoping to sock away some big money for his family before he dies. But the cancer might not get a chance to kill him after all... his new profession might just do it faster.

From frame one... of episode one... of season one... this series will grab you by the soft and hard parts and not let go. You will be drop-jaw-wowed by the production quality, scripts, acting, and execution of this stand-out series. 

True artistry and brilliance is transparent in writing and filmography so that what appears to come through is real life in all its gritty, ugly glory. Breaking Bad delivers in a way few series ever have. The casting is superb and virtually every actor is stellar. The twists and turns of the plot are delicious and the ride is as intoxicating, unpredictable and addictive as the killer meth Walter cooks up.

This AMC gem is every bit a premium cable channel production from start to finish. You will swear you're watching HBO or Showtime. If only every show on TV was even half as good! Breaking Bad deserves every industry award and accolade to be had.
