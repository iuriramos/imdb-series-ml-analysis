I have been glued to the screen for five seasons - approaching the end of Season 5 with reluctance. This is one of the best series I have ever seen with stunning acting. One flaw has kept me from giving it a ten. Everything to do with Skyler's pregnancy and with tbe baby just doesn't ring true, as if it was written by someone remote from the subject. Women of forty - however, glamorous - do not sail through pregnancy problem- free, occasionally stroking their bellies to remind us of what's going on. As for Holly, she must be the most unobtrusive infant in the history of mankind - occasionally someone shoves a bottle in her mouth or dandles her on their knee but she is simply not a presence in the family and seems happy to spend her time sitting in a baby chair looking demure. She also doesn't seem to be aging at the right pace. As I said, the only flaw I found.
