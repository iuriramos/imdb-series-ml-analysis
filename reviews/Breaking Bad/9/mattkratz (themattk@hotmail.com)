I have only seen a few episodes of this show, but I can see why people liked it so much! The plot was certainly different, with a chemistry teacher learning he has lung cancer and turning to making and selling crystal meth with one of his former students to provide financial stability for his family. I liked the scenes where they make the drug deal attempts and try to hide where they're making the stuff. I also think the scenes where he's with his family and his wife is pregnant-those are very touching. If this were a sitcom, the scenes where he's trying to hide what he's doing from his family would be funny! I loved to scene in the first episode where he coerces the student into helping him into helping him, and I like scene in an episode where the wife tries to return a gift and gets arrested for shoplifting it! This was one of the best shows of all time. *** out of ****
