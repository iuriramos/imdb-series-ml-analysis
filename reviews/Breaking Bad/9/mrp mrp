*** The spoilers here are minor. *** Breaking Bad is an excellent action TV series. It makes you think, too. That's not all that common of a combination. It has brains and brawn. It also has a good smattering of dark humor. There's lots of excellent character development and acting to be found here. On the other hand potential viewers should be advised that every once in a while there is extreme gore put on the TV screen - body dissolved in acid - detached head of a drug snitch attached to the back of a tortoise - etc. Hey, it's a series about drug dealing. On the other hand it's also a series about relationships between people, their aspirations, tragedies and the hidden dark spots in their lives. What good or evil are the people that you know really capable of? Did Pip in Great Expectations have a clue that his benefactor was the convict he had helped as a child? Sometimes people will do quite unexpected things.
