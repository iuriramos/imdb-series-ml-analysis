The incompetent schedulers of British TV have put this great show on at midnight. What is their problem? It deserves a wider audience. It is so well produced: the look is perfect; the location shooting vivid; the interiors full of atmosphere; the twists really unexpected; and the characters intriguing. The plotting is an ingenious mixture of personal psychology, family tensions and social comment. It knows how to keep viewers wanting more and to tune in next time. (Spoiler Ahead) Each week there is at least one stunning sequence: in Season 2 episode 7 there is a classic few minutes, which should be part of the curriculum of every film school, where the informant's head perched on top of a tortoise moves along a ridge and explodes with devastating effects on the DEA agents who've come to investigate.
