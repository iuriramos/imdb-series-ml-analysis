Many people and sources were telling me that this was one of the greatest shows on TV, so I was getting frustrated that I had not seen it, but I finally decided to give it a go when I had plenty of time to watch, I am so happy I did, created by Vince Gilligan. Basically the show sees the story of high school chemistry teacher Walter "Walt" White (Golden Globe winning and three-time nominated, and four-time Emmy winning and twice nominated Bryan Cranston, also producing, and directing some episodes), he is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, and he wants to make sure his family is financially supported after he dies. Therefore, with former student Jesse Pinkman (Golden Globe nominated, and three-time Emmy winning and twice nominated Aaron Paul), having seen the opportunity to make thousands of dollars from it, Walter with his chemistry knowledge manages to cook a perfect batch of crystallised methamphetamine, coloured blue, so he produces it and Jesse finds methods to sell it. They start independently, cooking in an RV, selling to psychopathic Mexican drug kingpin Tuco Salamanca (Raymond Cruz), with Walter using the alias "Heisenberg", but he becomes too dangerous to do business with, so they find a way to dispose of him and move on. Walter and Jesse settle on business with Gustavo 'Gus' Fring (Emmy nominated Giancarlo Esposito), a respected man who owns many businesses, including fast food restaurant chain Los Pollos Hermanos (Spanish for "The Chicken Brothers"), he uses his businesses to secretly distribute crystal meth across America, he gives the pair their own lab, hidden beneath his laundry business. Walter tries to balance his life of crime while continuing to maintain his family life, with wife Skyler (twice Emmy winning and nominated Anna Gunn), who eventually finds out, but helps to hide the money and all from teenage cerebral palsy suffering son Walter "Flynn" White, Jr. (RJ Mitte) and the rest of the family. Meanwhile, Walter's brother-in- law Hank Schrader (Under the Dome's Dean Norris) is a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent trying the stop the selling and distributions of drugs across America, especially crystal meth, following the many clues he finds to find "Heisenberg", he is completely unaware (until near the end) that his own brother-in-law is responsible. To make certain that business continues to grow, and the DEA and other authorities do not discover Walter, Jesse and all others involved, Walter hires lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) as their accomplice, he has connections to "fixers", and they also have his private investigator Mike Ehrmantraut (Emmy nominated Jonathan Banks), who also works for Gus, getting involved when needed. Throughout the series Walter struggles to keep his personal and "professional" life separate, with dangerous criminals and the authorities getting too close, Jesse struggles with his conscience in situations and to keep those he cares for safe, Hank gets obsessive about finding those spreading the blue crystal meth across the many states, and Skyler becomes understandably concerned for the safety of her family, as well as depressed and loathsome of Walter. In the end, after the deaths of Gus and Mike and much more going on, Walter's world crumbles when he is exposed for the drug criminal he is, Hank is killed, Jesse is forced to continue cooking by criminals, Walt goes into hiding for months with cancer before returning to see his family one last time and get revenge against the criminals who wronged him, Walt ends up mortally wounded and succumbs to his injury, dying as the police close in. Also starring Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader, Steven Michael Quezada as Steven "Gomie" Gomez, Charles Baker as Skinny Pete, Jesse Plemons as Todd, Christopher Cousins as Ted Beneke, Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte- Quayle, Matt Jones as Badger, Michael Shamus Wiles as ASAC George Merkert, Lavell Crawford as Huell, Krysten Ritter as Jane Margolis, Carmen Serano as Carmen Molina, Emmy nominated Mark Margolis as HÃ©ctor "Tio" Salamanca (the bell ringing wheelchair-bound silent former drug runner and enforcer, one of my favourite characters), David Costabile as Gale Boetticher, Michael Bowen as Uncle Jack and Robert Forster as Ed. Cranston gives a brilliant performance as the ordinary dying man turned ruthless drug maker, he's both the sympathetic and loathsome anti-hero, Paul is equally brilliant as the street-wise drug-taking young man who has an ever-changing personality and a conscience, supporting cast members Gunn and Norris and others give great performances as well. The show I admit started slightly slow, but you are certainly hooked, and by season 2 or 3 you are absolutely gripped and cannot stop watching, it has everything you could ask for: brilliant acting, writing and direction; it has danger, intrigue, small moments of comedy and much more, the best episodes I think are the TV break down in the middle of nowhere and in the lab trying to catch the fly, and of course I agree with critics and opinions that it has a fantastic ending, overall it is a a suitably acclaimed, unmissable and superb crime drama. It won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series - Drama, and it won the Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series (twice, also nominated three times), Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (also nominated three times) and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series (four times, also nominated five times), and it was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a One Hour Series (three times), Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series (twice), Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (five times), Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series, Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series (three times) and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One Hour) (twice). Very, very good!
