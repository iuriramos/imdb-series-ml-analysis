I have been forced to write this review after watching 2 seasons of Breaking Bad. This is one of the best series I have seen. EVER. Bryan Cranston is BAD ASS and his acting is one to be remembered. It is such a different character compared to his role in 'Malcom in the Middle'.

For those of you who enjoy watching action combined with drama and subtle humour, this is for you. This series may start out a little slow to the average viewers but once you get hooked, its hard to take your eyes off it. Everything is so unexpected and well planned and each episode begins from exactly where the previous episode left off. 

The acting is pretty good. One of the best part about Breaking Bad is the chemistry between Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. I love the attention to detail. Watch the series and you will know. The appearance of the characters that changes with time and such. 

Ps : Breaking Bad is dark and it kicks ass ! THUMBS UP !
