Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul is made legend series I can certainly recommend.

When I reviewed the first series, I asked: What is Walt up to? Is this some desperate, incoherent scream of rage in the face of the approaching blackness? In the end, we do learn the rather simpler answer because, well, Walt tells us. And it really does make sense of everything. Almost. Breaking Bad is great. But it's not perfect. Cranston's performance alone is enough to keep me watching for a while, but I'd like to see something resembling a completed formula, and soon.

This show is just amazing,I loved every episode,This is one of my favorite shows...... 

But....It's not for everyone ,This show is not safe for people under the age of 15.... 

But it is enjoyable for pretty much everyone else :D
