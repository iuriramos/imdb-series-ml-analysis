Breaking Bad is so good!! The writing is simply incredible. When I first started watching this show I was hesitant because I typically don't watch shows like this. (I prefer, SNL, 30 rock etc) But when my cousin told me to watch it, after at least 3 episodes I got hooked! The plot is extremely intense, and super suspenseful. Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor, the character he plays is extremely complex due to learning he has lung cancer in the pilot, then later hiding a secret life of cooking meth from his pregnant wife. As someone who only knew him as 'the dad from Malcom in the Middle' he is so much more then that! His performance in this show, its truly phenomenal, in every way. There's a little bit of humor throughout the series as well, which lightens the hectic plot. I'd say the only downside is that, there aren't that many episodes, the seasons aren't your typical 20-25 episode seasons. I wouldn't suggest this show for younger audiences, because there is a solid amount of cursing, constant discussion of drugs, a little blood and guts and some sex. Other then that, its totally worth watching!!
