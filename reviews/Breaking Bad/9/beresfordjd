Cranston became my favourite comedy actor in Malcolm in the Middle, his timing is impeccable and his physicality brought a freshness to his performance. In Breaking Bad he proves that he is not limited in any way to comedy. Supported by a great cast of more than competent actors (with a special mention for Aaron Paul) Cranston is riveting as a terminally ill chemistry teacher who turns to the dark side to provide for his soon-to-be bereaved family.There are elements of comedy in Breaking Bad-very,very black comedy but comedy nonetheless and that too strikes just the right note in the writing and performances. Not one bit of this story would work if any of the writing,direction or acting was wrong. Everything is spot on. The characters are not written or played as stereotypes and the script is tight and drives the story along. The whole enterprise is about as absorbing as drama can be and one cannot wait to see what happens from one episode to the next- and what happens is never predictable. As for the people who throw up their hands in horror and say that a programme like this glorifies drug dealing and drug use, then watch the damn thing!! If ever a programme shows what drugs do to people then BB does. A real cautionary tale.

I am into series 2 now and hope that the standard continues in the third series. A terrific example of what can be done with TV drama when playing it safe is off the agenda.
