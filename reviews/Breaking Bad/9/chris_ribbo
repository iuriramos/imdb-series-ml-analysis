I do have to say this is one of the best TV series i have seen in a while. it has everything drama ,action , drugs and more . i found the first series to be very light hearted in comparison to the rest of the TV show as Walter is starting out and really doesn't know what to do and is afraid at everything. After the episode in the first series where he is Nico's place (i think thats his name not sure)and blows it up with a meth look-a-like bomb, he starts to realize he gets a buzz from what he is doing and from there on he slowly develops into a man who you can hardly recognize as Walter wight.i do think the second series out of all of them was kinda weak in comparison to the others as Walter takes a break from dealing drugs and it focuses more on character development.Over all i think this TV show is incredible and Bryan Cranston's performance was truly amazing especially since this is the man from Malcolm in the middle. Aaron Paul was very good in this also and you get to see how Jesse slowly spirals down from confident to timid and you can see how the events of the series have effected him greatly.
