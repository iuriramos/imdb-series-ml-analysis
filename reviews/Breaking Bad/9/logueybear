It says something about a TV show when even the episodes could be called, 'filler' are entertaining and do something great. Breaking Bad is a show where no episode, scene or moment is wasted. Everything about it is brilliant, the writing is masterful, handling characters and plots with ease with each season building on the next. Delivering both funny, profound, shocking and heartbreaking moments. The directing is superb especially considering they film each episode in only eight days. It always tries to do different things while always serving the story. Visually it is wondrous to behold. The acting is top notch, Bryan Cranston delivers Walter Whites slow decline into villainy wonderfully and Aaron Paul will only be remembered for his role as Pinkman.

This show delivers, when people say it's great, they mean it. It is one of the best shows I have ever seen.
