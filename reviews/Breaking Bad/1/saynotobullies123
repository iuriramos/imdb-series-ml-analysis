This has got to be one of the worst TV shows of all time. What do you people see in it? I wanted all the characters killed off except for Saul and the cop. Plot's dull. Story lines stupid. The women characters are weak and the show make them all look like bickering airheads. Maybe it's because USA is full of druggies and that's why they like it so much? Games of Thrones and Hell on Wheels are thousand times better than this terrible, terribleshow. There's wit and substantive dialogue. I had a terrible migraine after finishing the 2nd season of Breaking Bad. Maybe people can related b/c they all do drugs. I don't know. I'm still trying to figure this out.
