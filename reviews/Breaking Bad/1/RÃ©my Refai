"Tread Carefully" as the last episode was called (Season 5 Episode 09) Was probably the worst episode that could be created, I'm not sure what the director was thinking? Maybe he wanted to give us a nightmare of an episode and then blow our minds on the next. Anyhow, He downgraded my love for the show from 10 to a stable 7 with just 1 episode. There is not much I could tell you about this episode other than it was awful, Right down the drain, 50 minutes of regret, I'm lying now in my bed, feeling lonely and frustrated of how just one episode could downgrade your favorite show from number 1 to a probable number 10-15. Sincerely yours, RÃ©my
