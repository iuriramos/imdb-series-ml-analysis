I just finished the series and I signed up IMDb for the sole purpose of giving this 1 star.

The actors all do a good job with the parts they are given. Rather than spend time critiquing the on-screen talent I must voice my extreme displeasure with the writing. I guess now it's commonplace for television shows to be as violent and gory as possible (i.e. Sons of Anarchy) but in my opinion this was hands down the absolute worst piece of garbage to ever be televised.

I have zero desire to see people doing drugs. I have zero desire to watch human bodies chemically decompose. I don't see how it's possible for a nerdy high-school chemistry teacher to turn into such a horrible piece of filth. I don't want to watch innocent people get shot in the head by the dregs of society. Sorry, it's not my thing.

After the first two seasons I was ready to call it quits. Peer pressure and the "critical acclaim" was the reason I decided to finish it. All I have to say to that is - the masses are a bunch of idiots for enjoying this garbage. This is what happened during the writing process: "Hey, let's try to find up as many f'ed up ways for people to die as possible. Let's glorify the jerks that engage in drug trafficking and kill off innocent people, because hey, that stuff happens in real life." This series is proof of the total degradation of society. No, I'm not some grumpy old man. This crap makes me sick to my stomach. Since this was "wildly successful" then I'm sure other writers will try to push the bar even further. I will find a list of the writers and make sure to avoid any project they are ever involved with in the future.

Thanks for wasting my time.
