Im a fan of AMC so after Breaking Bad got all these awards I thought I better check it not knowing idea what it was all about.

A meth lab blew up a few block from my house a few years back. The man who was running the lab blew up himself and his toddler child who was in the house with him. Leave it to Hollywood to make a drama of something to twist it into something so viewers can have a false connection to it. Never mind all the lives that have been destroyed by drugs. Never mind the Innocent people that have died in the manufacturing of drugs, the transportation, and especial the innocence that have suffered who did not intend to have any part of the matter.

"oh but hes doing it for his family because hes a family man."

THEN BE A REAL MAN AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY LIKE A REAL MAN!

When the world burns I hope California is first so I can pop corn and watch that.
