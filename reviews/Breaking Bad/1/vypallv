I don't know why people are praising this show, there's no substance for about 70% of the time, just talking about something that doesn't impact the story. 

The characters are very dull, and lacking in well character. I feel as though they are just there to look at; they don't connect with the character, I don't feel anything for them - which means that I don't care if they live or die - which means that I'm not in suspense at all.

There's about 3 good scenes in the whole of the show but 'Mythbusters' proved them all to be wrong and so unreal that it makes the chemistry feel cheap.

This show may appeal to some people but it really doesn't deserve 1/4 of the hype that it has.

Don't watch it, you'll be wasting your time.
