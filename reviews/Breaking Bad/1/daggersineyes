So many people recommended this to me but I kept reading bits about it and hesitating because it didn't sound very enthralling. Finally I gave in and watched Season 1 - and I was hugely disappointed. I only kept going with each episode because people kept saying it gets better & asking me to give it a chance and I'd love it. Well, sorry but I didn't. I had no connection to any of the characters in it and couldn't have cared less what happened to them. Many of the characters, particularly the women, were awful stereotypes with no depth. The script was boring, the plot was ridiculous and the cinematography & direction often irritating. One or two of the actors tried their best and were good but that isn't enough when the material is so woeful. Mostly tho the show just bored me to tears. 

I have no clue why this is getting such rave reviews, awards etc. It feels like a case of the "The Emporer's New Clothes" to me where people are convinced it must be good because everyone else says so! And I've noticed anyone who writes a review on their blog/website that does anything short of praise this as the greatest TV series in history is inundated with the shows fans hurling childish badly worded abuse at them and suggesting they are "(offensive word of some sort) morons" etc. That disgustingly stupid behaviour in itself tells me more about the show than any review can.
