I was really excited about watching this show due numerous recommendations from friends & other people. I had just finished re- watching the whole 6 seasons of the Sopranos for like the 10th time & I was looking for another show to fulfill my hunger for raw television show drama that is founded on intelligent plots & great acting. So I was excited & in an I-cant-wait mood when I pushed that play button as I started watching the first episode of the first season.

But man, if I say I was disappointed that would be an underestimate of my reaction. I could NOT believe that someone in their right mind could recommend this show as an excellent show. And to think that I had actually read somewhere where other people were comparing this show to a great show like the Sopranos, and some even claiming that its a greatest television show ever, it was just saddening.

I mean, there's nothing in this show that makes it a good show. There is NOT one character that's worth watching. I mean Walter tries hard to keep the show going but his whole story is just nothing but some cooked up story that insults any intelligent mind. His wife not only annoys but there is nothing in the show that makes someone be sympathetic with her. And their son, not being disrespectful to the disabled, is so annoying & it appears his appearance in the show is nothing but a plot by the writers of the show to get some sympathy for this family from the audience. And don't get me started on the Jessie Pinkman character. He is the whole reason why after watching a few episodes of the second season I completely gave up on the show.

I don't recommend this show to anyone with sense. I am so surprised with the awards & the positive reviews its getting. And I know its not me, because I know the difference between good & bad writing, acting & production. So yeah like I said, I don't care what anybody says, this show sucks big time.
