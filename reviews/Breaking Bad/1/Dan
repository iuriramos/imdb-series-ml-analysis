Simple facts: Want an ACTUAL masterclass in writing, storytelling, acting, emotion etc etc from beginning to end? Watch LOST. AKA a legitimate contender for the single greatest TV Drama of ALL TIME, As well as being unarguably the single most stunningly unique television show ever put to screen.

There just seems to be this overall general idiotic, tasteless stigma that's been spreading in all areas of pop culture for the past few years now. From equally scary dumb, loser nerds praising factually inferior video game platforms like horrendous PC "gaming" (despite the little important fact that 80% of the actual best/biggest games in the industry NEVER come to that overpriced, laughably overrated platform) to the exact same happening with equally clueless Android phone sheep taking out their worryingly stupid levels of butthurt on every MUCH more successful Apple device. All just because Apple is the top dog worldwide, which makes these cheeto dust smelling, basement dwellers cry in their playpens oh-so much all day, every day XD. I honestly don't know whether to laugh or cry in these types of beyond pathetic situations.

The overall takeaway: If you're a Breaking Bore/Game of Incest watching, PC Inferior Race playing, Android device hacking doofus fanboy then PLEASE.........wear a big, triangle shaped hat whenever you're out in public so I can know to stay at least 50 feet away from complete goons like yourself at all times.

Thanks ; )
