Seriously?!?!? Best series ever?!?!? Breaking Bad?!?!?! Really?!?!!? noooo, I mean dead noooo. It gets 1 for awful from me because of that. You just can't have Breaking Bad for best series ever. Junkies, drugs, violence and bad acting.. I guess a lot of people like that. What can you expect from TV other than garbage.. From now i am changing IMDb as a source of information for the quality of series or movies, sorry to say. Or maybe I should be glad that they don't have for number one Pretty Little Liars or Black List.. i guess. Who pays people to give high ratings to garbage? disappointing.. ps: I don't understand why I get this message: "Your review does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text. Please see the guidelines. Attempts to pad the comment with junk words can result in your account being blocked from future submissions." and how other people's comments are 2-3 lines short. oh well.. more disappointing..
