I know this is a poular show and i will probably get hate for this but anyway here it is. Walters beard makes me want to be sick. and i don't like his kid either. why is this even a show? there is 0 character development(apart from Jess) and there is almost no plot either like "oh i am bored i will make drugs" wtf. I don't think this is very realistic because I don't think drug dealers would be this angry in real life. Like he is angry about bacon, but ergular drug dealers probably aren't angry about bacon so wtf? I also don't like the brther. i don't know what disease he has but i feel like him not being able to walk is representing something like drugs.
