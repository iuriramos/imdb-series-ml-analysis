Sorry? 9.6 rating? Better than Game of Thrones, Suits and other great T.V shows.

There isn't a single main Character that I liked apart from Jesse. Walt is an utter @sshole and if the main guy who you're supposed to be connecting to makes your skin crawl every time you see him, how are you supposed to enjoy this series.

He makes out like he's cooking for his family but is he really? He worked out in the car he needed 370k for his family before he died yet at the end of the 5th season before most of it gets taken he has 80million, that isn't for his family he's just greedy. He doesn't think about anyone but himself, will kill anyone to keep himself safe.

and as the title says people saying comedy can't think of a time I laughed once other than when I laughed at the annoying acting of walt Jr. and that's no disrespect to the disabled.
