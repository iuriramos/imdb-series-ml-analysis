I've just watched all 5 Seasons of this on the internet.

The characters are completely unreal, out of touch with reality.

I've fast forwarded 40% of the show, due to complete lack of substance in the scenes

This show, while having potentially a good idea for the plot, completely fails. Complete failure on all accounts.

This could have been an OK movie, given different cast and reworked plot so it would be more on the Donnie Brasko level

But this is not a movie and the plot is so lame.. its on Sesame Street level

Moreover, the show is plainly annoying. Completely unbelievable. Plot holes the size of Jupiter.

I gotta say that the Pilot episode was somewhat OK, but as the show goes on with each episode it gets more and more idiotic with the last episode of the Season 5.. being the lamest piece of sh-t ever made on TV. I mean i have not ever seen such idiocy even in the B-movies from the 80s. And they had some really stupid movies in the 80s.

Anyway.. anyone thinking on wasting their time on this show.. DON'T

PS And OH Jesus!!! The retarded kid.. he is in every episode.. and the women in this show.. the wives.. OH MAN... you'd wish, someone kills them, the whole show

PSS I can accept idiotic fantasy such as GoT but Breaking Bad posing as something based on reality is completely unacceptable.
