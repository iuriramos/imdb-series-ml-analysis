Contains SPOILERS I have never written a review before, but i couldn't help myself. THIS SHOW SUCKS. This is by far the WORST show i have ever seen. OMG, The errors that are made, all that nonsense that is said, it is boring, and how they make Walter look like the good guy is just SICKENING. It looks like they motivate people to make this choice. This is really disturbing. If u like this show, u will have to be a madman yourself. At least a little bit. I wish i could give this a 0/10. I really struggled to watch this show and it is most certainly the most awful show ever. U should never want to watch something like this. It can never be unseen, which is sad.
