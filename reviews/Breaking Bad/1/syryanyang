The two main characters in this series are annoying as hell. Walter White, supposedly a chemistry genius, is an underachiever in life but somehow decided to the dat boss upon releasing he's got cancer.He's so cocky that he thinks he's smarter than anyone.He killed two drug dealers and is responsible for the death of Tuco, Gale and Jane whose death led to a huge plane crash. And he's not guilty of any of those deaths, this makes me sick. Not to mention his secret gay/father-son love towards Jesse Pinkman. He's happy making millions cooking meth under the name of "providing for his family" which couldn't be further from the truth. Maybe he started with such intention but lost himself in the process. Now he's just ecstatic that he's actually achieving something for the first time in his life, regardless of how serious the crime he committed. He's also responsible for Hank's unfortunate injury. Jesse Pinkman on the other hand is a really nice person. He loves kids, cares for his friends, treats people well. He killed an innocent man only to save Walter and is forever haunted for it. But he's a junkie, this "habit" of his led to the death of his beloved girlfriend. He's damned. Now Gustavo Fring, this biggest drug deal north of the border, always drives himself without a bodyguard. And his man, Mike, who does everything for him yet still finds a way to earn some extra bucket working as a part-time PI. There are a few likable characters nevertheless. Mike being one of them. Saul Goodman and Hank Schrader are two of my favorites.
