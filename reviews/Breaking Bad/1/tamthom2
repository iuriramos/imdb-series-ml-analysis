Sorry but I just don't get the hype. You want a synopsis? Every episode basically consists of the following: artsy vague beginning sequence attempting to pique our interest but eventually becoming parody, yelling, bitching wife, Walt looking pained but not answering any of bitching wife's questions, Jesse getting beat up and generally fumbling around, frustratingly stupid scenarios, more bitching wife, more yelling, Walt and Jesse somehow 3 Stooging their way out of frustratingly stupid scenario. You want fascinating character study, dialogue that makes you pause rewind and watch it again, and TV that means something? Skip this. Watch The Wire.
