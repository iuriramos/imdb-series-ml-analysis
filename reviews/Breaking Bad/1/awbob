Heard great things about this series and was bitterly disappointed. I sat through the first season as it was only 7 eps however I gave up after 2 eps of season 2 as I was still waiting for something to happen. I was expecting a gritty crime thriller and instead was treated to a slow moving, way too American load of drivel. By all means watch this if you want to spend your time watching his ugly irritating wife and equally irritating in-laws sit around whinging and whining for two thirds of the show. I might as well have been watching a lecture on the healing benefits of sharing or living right the American way. 

This show was so bad it kept me awake thinking about the time I wasted.

Way too slow and boring to keep me interested... Decided to rewatch star trek TNG instead.
