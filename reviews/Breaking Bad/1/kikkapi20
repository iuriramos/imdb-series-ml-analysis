Best show in TV ever? Master Piece? Yeah, right! Its good, but its NOT THAT GOOD! Read so much about this show, got the whole 5 season to to find the critics were so off! First of all, the script was boring, dull and predictable. Terminally ill chemistry teacher X mid life crisis? A recipe for yawn! As for acting, to be fair, Bryan Cranston is good, better than Liev Schreiber in Ray Donovan, but definitely could not beat James Spader in Black List and Kevin Spacey as FU for the Golden Globe 2013! When I binge on the Black List and Utopia I wished everyday had 48 hours and wish it would never end. With Breaking Bad, after the first season I basically dozed through the second season and then just turning it on while working just for the heck of it.
