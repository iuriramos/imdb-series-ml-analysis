I don't usually write a review, but 9,6 rating for BB is too much for me. I guess I can understand the ''existential anger'' people feel in the modern world, but WW is not the embodiment of it.

First, as someone who HAD a cancer patient in my family, I'm deeply upset by representation of cancer patients in this series. Sure it's just a ''plot thing'', nowadays everything is f...... narrative, just get along, it will pay off - it's kid's talk. It upsets me. You don't have to embody existential crisis by literal cancerous growth, it's scriptwriting for idiots. You have existential crisis in True detective and you don't have cancer.

Second, is it really ''existential''? I mean, the only thing I see is a high school professor turning into an animal who marks his territory (stay away from my supermarket!). It's libertarianism at it's worst. The big father of the family doesn't take charity, becomes a drug boss, gets angry at anyone who compromises his manhood, says ''I win'' when he ''wins'', wow, and I thought Adorno was joking when he sad TV programme is made for 11 year olds. Eleven year olds on a ''free market''.

You think there's something deep in here, well, there is, deep male insecurity and fear that tries to compensate the lack by criminal activity and masculine hyperrealism. It has been done in Godfather with Italian rednecks - Sicilians. Being a man doesn't mean to be a primitive a$$hole.

Sorry for my English, I really couldn't be bothered to look up the dictionary if I made some grammatical mistakes. There's plenty of chauvinist, patriarchal and libertarian crap in BB, so it makes us even.
