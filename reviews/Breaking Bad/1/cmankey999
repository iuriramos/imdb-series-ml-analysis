Stupid TV series about a nobody who becomes a psychopath. How a worthless chemistry teacher becomes a mass murdering drug dealer. I tried to watch this filth for 2 seasons before I realize how worthless it is . I watch Walter kill 2 drug dealers and melt them in an acid bath, blow up another with mercury fulminate.I guess he causes an airliner crash after allowing his partners girlfriend to die on her own vomit. Good writing, TV! Just utter trash. I guess this loser goes on to kill a little boy, kill his brother in law Hank and finally die. Good riddance to bad trash. I won't be watch this immoral trash again. Thank you
