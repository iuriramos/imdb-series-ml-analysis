Avoid this show! Tastes are different, I do agree, so that's why this show has a 9,6 grade. It was definitely graded so high by those who wanted to find out and learn how to make crystal meth, kill a person, get rid of a corpse etc. I really can't see what's interesting about this show. The plot is very disgusting and morbid, I wouldn't recommend this to an adult, let alone a young adult or a teenager. Can someone really grade as a 10 melting a corpse with acid in a bath tub? After that, cleaning blood and bones...! I would like to know what kind of population graded this series as a 10?! It is very sad that this show is a hit on the social networks for quite a while.
