I don't get all the hype we found it very slow with not as much action as was hoping for considering how most people said how amazing it was, I mean chasing a fly around his lab all episode. We sat through every episode hoping it would really blow us away, but as any build up started happening it seemed to go nowhere leaving us frustrated. The first episode was the best one but it just seemed like the writers got board. On the plus side Hank was superb and we liked Gus but we just couldn't warm to Walter and Jess. Sorry to be negative I have rated other series like Dexter, walking dead and tyrant very high so I'm not all complete doom and gloom, I just can't believe all the rave reviews but everyone has an opinion. Oh and I have never written a review before I'm just bewildered why people think this is the best series ever. It makes me cringe when I hear people talking about it.
