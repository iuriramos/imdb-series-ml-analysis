I have nothing else to watch so I finally decided to watch the final season of Breaking Bad. I couldn't stand listening to the tedious dialogue between the characters in the earlier shows so I hoped that at least the last season would be better. I was wrong!! The finale has got to be the worst season of all. I am still in awe why anyone finds the show entertaining. First the entire plot is stupid and then if he's dying, why does he need to kill Mike in 5th season? He's got boatloads of $ so take some and go away on a long trip, and please just DIE. I've been fast forwarding through most of the shows. I think I'm going to skip the rest of the shows, go to the last one so I can see WW die.
