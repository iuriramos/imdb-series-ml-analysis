Out of curiosity I borrowed the Breaking Bad DVDs from a friend and watched all episodes before writing this comment. So the first few episodes are okay, some of them are even good. But then it's getting less interesting and I have to say some of the episodes are not just plain stupid, but really really stupid that you would hate yourself and regret having watched it. For instance, there is this one episode (forgot the season and episode number) where these Walter and Jesse guys spend the entire half-hour chasing a fly. And add to that another five to ten minutes of Walter explaining to Jesse why the lab has to be clean. 

I finally find out why the rating at IMDb is so high. Most of the people who gave 9/10 stars rated the show when it has just began airing in 2008/2009. I am sure if they watched the rest of the episodes and found out how stupid the rest of the show are they would rate it differently.
