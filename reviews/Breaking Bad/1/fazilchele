Why God why? This is pure pain in the name of television show, utter garbage. This has got to be a seriously boring show. I gave it a try after lots of hype surrounding it. But all I got was painfully long stares and silences, and boring dialogues. Same boring storyline dragging along every episode. It soon grew on me. After giving it 9 episodes I finally gave up. I just don't understand the hype. And lastly it teaches guns drugs and violence is cool, what the hell? If you want gritty and riveting Dramas I'll recommend shows like Dexter and American Horror Story. I know I'm gonna get lots of thumbs down but sorry Breaking Bad did not impress me.
