Jesse is the worst thing about this show. There was a reason he was to be killed off at the end of the first season and they should have let it go at that. 

I would have preferred to see the progression of Walt alone, without his (Jesse) character's stupidity pushing the story line. 

To me this is the one flaw in the show. Here you have a character (Walt) who, over time, becomes the epitome of scum and ruthlessness ... and the story line is fully manipulated by the aimless idiocy from the Jesse character. It. just. does. not. wash. I don't care how good the acting is. In any reality, that idiot would be dead. 

If it wasn't for the finite nature of the series (ending season 5), I would have left it during season 3 (and i know a lot of people who did). It's just ridiculous that he was left in.
