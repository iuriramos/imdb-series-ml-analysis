This show is missing a soul: a beating heart below the surface. 

At first glance BB seemed pretty cool to me, but after a while everything started feeling out of place; the funny moments are just uncomfortable. The storyline, which could've been exciting, completely loses all tension within the first episode; quite an achievement! The family scenes with great comic potential never work out because everyone is behaving like psychopaths. I mean, none of the characters in Seinfeld are particularly pleasant and yet they make for good viewing, because they actually respond to their environment in a manner that we can relate to. The violence felt all wrong too. I like my gore (Braindead) as much as the next guy, but it needs to intensify the experience of the story; in BB it's just giving people something to gross out on to prevent them from realizing that nothing important is really happening (Game of Thrones anyone?).

The fact that so many people lose their mind over this show worries me a bit. Then again, I suppose every generation gets the TV show it deserves. We live in confusing times. The good news is that people want to be entertained by something as different as Breaking Bad. The bad news is that what they're excited by is so hollow.
