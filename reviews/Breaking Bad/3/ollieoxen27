I get it. A disrespected teacher with cancer decides to be a drug manufacturer to help his family after he passes. There must be some good in him - who are we to judge? After all his wife works for a tax cheat, his brother in law is abusive to Mexicans, and his son is disrespectful.

Trouble with moral ambiguity is it ultimately excuses all behavior. The people who make this program live in Hollywood so obviously they use drugs, know a lot about drugs, and know others involved in it. After all they're cool and it's a good way to make money by creating a program that helps amoral people feel better about themselves just because they snort a little, or cheat a little.

The question I'd like to ask is whether the makers of this program - the actors, producers, sponsors, and indirectly the viewers would like this program if it meant hit men with guns and axes would stalk their families and kill their family members?

I didn't think so. The moral - don't exploit tragedy just because it's cool, it makes money, and it makes amoral people feel better about themselves. If you're not part of the solution you are part of the problem.
