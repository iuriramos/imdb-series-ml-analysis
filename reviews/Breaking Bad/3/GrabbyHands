As someone who is used to shows being touted as "life-changing" and "brilliant" I ignored all of the hype about this show until recently, when I saw that there was a museum devoted to art based on this show, not to mention a "First World Problems" meme where someone said that Breaking Bad made other television unwatchable. I just had to watch it.

Surprise! It's mediocre.

This is more "gangster" entertainment aimed at people who need gangster entertainment as escapist fantasy, but otherwise this isn't any different from other FANTASTIC TV THAT YOU CAN'T MISS that everyone forgets about as soon as it gets canceled.
