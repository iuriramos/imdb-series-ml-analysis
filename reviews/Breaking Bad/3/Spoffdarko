I made it to Episode 6 of season 2.

I am finished now...

As the title says, this is a horrible show full of horrible people, I simply could not connect with any of them, it bums me out after every episode and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, episode 6 of season 2 (Peekaboo) finished me off, I am not prepared to watch things like that if there is no balance (at least there is no balance for me, some people may find the "lighter" moments good, but I didn't) The show is just constantly depressing.

The acting is "ok" at best, the jokes are not really funny, the drama is annoying and has a "seen it all before" feel to it, and all the characters are selfish, miserable, stupid ar$e-holes.

People say this is the best show of all time, hmmm, I don't think so, this is not even in the same league as The Sopranos, and is certainly not as good as: Walking dead, Dexter, Game of Thrones, Mad Men and a few others I could name.

I give it 3 stars because there were one or two moments of decent comedy, and the occasional bit of good writing, but how this stinking turd comprised of human misery rates so high generally is beyond me.
