"Breaking Bad" is something we rarely see these days, and there is a hunger for it  the well-done morality play. This one was brilliantly done. The show demonstrated, often in surprising ways, that actions have consequences, and how lying destroys relationships, and how deadly is the fine art of rationalizing immoral actions. Even when we didn't know where the story was going, no matter how unpredictable, it always made sense from that character's point of view  a bit like O. Henry in that regard. No need to suspend disbelief. It was literary in the quality of the writing and artistic in how it was filmedthe unusual camera points of view, taking advantage of the vivid colors of the southwest, the dark humor. The casting was perfect, the acting was perfect, the end was perfect. The last scene was one of the best I've ever seen on film, possibly the best. I watched it more than once.
