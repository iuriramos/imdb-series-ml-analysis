I don't know where to begin but let me tell you one thing, I have avoided this series when it first came out and because of my false judgements I am regretful till this very moment. This show is the epitome of gold on TV and not to forget the elegant and far beyond marvellous works of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul who very well deserved the awards that they have received a few years back. Let me sum up this whole review by saying NEVER JUDGE A SERIES BY EYE BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THE BEAUTY AND EXCELLENCE THAT LIES BEHIND. That is to say that I was unaware of something spectacular and if you haven't watched it yet YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO!!!!
