Can't believe I just checked out the Greatest Show on TV 2 weeks when it was about to end since people all over networking sites were buzzing about it and it got me curious. One lazy Wednesday afternoon, I've nothing else to do I decided to take a look. I was hooked the very first episode like no ever show had hooked me before. Knowing that the internet is a galaxy of spoilers I decided to stay away from it as I finish the whole show in week. 

Now that it's all over it left and at the same time leaving a void in me wanting for more. I was very sad that I just enjoyed it just for a few weeks while those others who were into the show a long time had lots of fun talking about it. It made me feel that I missed the party of the decade. Up until now I still can't get over it as I browse the remnants of breaking bad discussions
