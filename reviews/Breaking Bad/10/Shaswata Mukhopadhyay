No doubt it is the best TV series.The story really touches our heart. The first season was a worthy start.We come to know about Walter White,the man with the Chemistry High School Teacher-cum-"The man who knocks". The second season unfolds the story ,while the third,fourth and fifth season will keep you rooted to the spot .The last 3 seasons brings out other lead characters like Saul Goodman,Mike Ehrmantraut,Hector Salamanca,Todd Alquist etc.Vince Gilligan was the mastermind and really did a great job.Now talking about the actors Bryan Cranston(Walter White),Aaron Paul(Jesse Pinkman) and Anna Gunn(Skyler White) was at their career best while Bob Odenkirk(Saul Goodman),Giancarlo Esposito(Gustavo Fring),Jonathan Banks(Mike Ehrmantraut) were awesome. I cried as the series ended and badly wanted for more seasons to come. It's a must watch for everyone and I hope you will enjoy the 'nail-biting' episodes. Thank you !
