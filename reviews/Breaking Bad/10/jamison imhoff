The underground world of illegal narcotics has never been displayed in such a captivating, elaborate fashion. Breaking Bad does an excellent job of taking you on a journey. A journey of one man's downward spiral into the methamphetamine world. 

The story is captivating and intriguing. The gradual progression of the characters is believable and wildly exciting. There is rarely a dull moment in Breaking Bad. There may be some more seemingly calm moments, but the way that the story unfolds always leaves tension in the air. 

Not only is the story incredible, the cinematic vision is some of the best I have ever seen. The transitions are so smooth and clever. Situations where someone stands up from a couch in one room and sits down in another seamlessly, or a vacuum is heard in a room and the same seemingly obnoxious sound changes unknowingly to a car wash without the viewer noticing happens regularly. Kudos to the transition guys for sure!

All in all, Breaking Bad is a terrible story that somehow pulls in and holds the viewer in a suspension of pure awesome. If you have not started watching it, then what are you doing here still reading this review. GO. Watch it. Now.
