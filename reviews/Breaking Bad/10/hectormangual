There are no words to fully describe "Breaking Bad". It is truly a show of its own. Its a show that draws such a personal attachment to all the characters...a show that make you feel with the story and leaves you every single episode wanting to hit "Play Next Episode" on your Netflix account. Sure some episodes are slow but its for a reason, every second of every episode is for a reason. If you have been living under a rock for the last few years and haven't watched this show...I suggest you do. Its the greatest show in TV history and there will never be another like it! Its dark yet has humorous moments and will leave you at the edge of your couch every time! WATCH BREAKING BAD!!!!!!
