This show is so real its content could easily be construed as too dangerous for TV but is by far the best action packed real to life show I've seen on television to date. I find myself enjoying every facet especially the brilliance behind the program that brought it into our homes where we could experience how normal law abiding citizens can become involved in illicit behavior to benefit loved ones. I enjoy the range of characters,the writer and producer have accurately depicted organized crime bosses to street corner meth heads all filling their place in this drug crazed world. As characters develop you realize business is business even in the drug world. As Walt climbs the corporate ladder you can't help but admire his ability to negotiate, interpolate, and take each new level in stride. Walt's heroic persona depicts strength at so many levels but an unyielding love for family , he ignores personal risk even his own values while focusing on building a financial empire for those he loves. His relationship with Jessie is in itself brilliant as he depicts a mentor, almost father like role yet conflicts and personality differences create one fine show! I applaud each who's taken part in seeing this show through fruition and hope you will enjoy benefits for a very long time. "Thank you"!
