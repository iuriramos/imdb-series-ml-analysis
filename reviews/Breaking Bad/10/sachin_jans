Never in my life have I come across a series as perfect as this one. I have watched numerous series, and this is the one that has taken the first position of them all. Man, how did they ever create a series so enthralling, that I didn't even feel the time fly. I has to sit and watch the entire series in less than two months, and now I regret on the haste. Because it was bloody brilliant. 

Hank, Jesse, Anna, Flynn, Gus, Mike.....all characters of perfection. And Walter White? He was the man. He became an employee of the devil. Then he became the devil, and ends as a mere man. I multiple levels, this is a perfect philosophical drama as well. Perfection is every frame, and every bit of the story is simply perfect.

This is perfectly bad! The greatest series for one to watch!
