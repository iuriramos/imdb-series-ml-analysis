Realizing nothing I can say here will add to what you already have heard endlessly repeated in exhortations undoubtedly more eloquently phrased than I could ever emulate, please indulge what I consider to be my obligation to share something with you that has impacted my life profoundly. I'm not one to use words lightly, and have always been wary of superlatives. I have enjoyed a rewarding life with a family I love very much. They love me back, I'm convinced, but they can't understand how the fictional universe of Breaking Bad has given me an entirely different view of so many aspects of life. The show changed me in ways I'm still discovering; my thought processes seem to trickle through new filters in ways I sometimes find sublime, other times, abhorrent. Almost never dull. I used to try to explain the hows and whys of this to them, but the blank stares evoke pearls before swine, so why bother? 

I'm not blind to the potential mental illness that can be inferred by the thoughts I'm writing about. I just don't care. There's a huge kindred that know my feelings precisely, but that's not who I'm hoping reads this. I'm hoping this post reaches *you*, who has read this far into it. Watch this show. Don't think for a minute that it's not something you'd like because it's about a world you're unfamiliar with. The drugs and violence are just where Vince Gilligan hung his hat to sit and tell you what will be the best story you've ever had the pleasure of hearing. I envy you. If I could erase this show from my memory and watch it with virgin eyes... I would sacrifice quite a bit to be that fortunate. 

Game Of Thrones is a ten-star show. Breaking Bad goes to eleven, and then some.
