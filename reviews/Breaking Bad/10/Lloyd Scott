I will not waste your time with a long a detailed review. You could spend the time better starting the inevitable Breaking Bad marathon you will undertake the second you finish episode 1. You cannot carry on in your life without watching this. I took me less than a week to watch all 5 seasons. I have never been so emotionally moved by a TV series. The actors took their roles to a whole new level. I was not familiar with them until this production. I will now relish the opportunity to see them in past and future roles. Every episode leaves you on a hair pulling cliff hanger dieing of desperation to watch the next. I cannot imagine the pain that people went through waiting week after week to watch this. I'n the end you are left with an award worthy final episode that will not only entertain you, it will move you and will leave you satisfied with no question unanswered. Your only option its to watch this masterpiece, it will complete you.
