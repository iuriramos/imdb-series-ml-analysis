I have NEVER been a fan for the type of TV series where you HAVE to watch every episode to understand what exactly is going on. I also personally don't like being obligated to watch every episode in chronological order especially when each episode is 45 minutes long or more. Thats quite a bit of time I have to commit to the series. 

This has been the first series that I have watch all the way through. Binged watched actually. So far, other than sitcoms, Breaking Bad is the only drama series that I have watched every episode, which totals out to be 1 day 22 hours and 30 minutes of non-stop viewing. 

It was worth it!
