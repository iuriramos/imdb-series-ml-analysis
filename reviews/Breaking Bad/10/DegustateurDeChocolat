If I could I would have given 11 out of 10 since this TV series is so well made that few others series could have been as much entertaining as this one. As a matter of fact Breaking Bad has everything: irony, especially in the first two series the relationship and the situations between Jessie and Walter are amusing, besides some particular characters as Hank and Saul Goodman; the plot is very well developed and compelling since the beginning and in the 4th and 5th series there's a continuous climax and the story line takes an unexpected turn; the characters are psychologically studied in depth through their change from the 1st to the last season; the actors are all great, but Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul deserve a special mention.
