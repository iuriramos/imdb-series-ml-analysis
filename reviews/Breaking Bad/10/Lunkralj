Dear team of Breaking Bad, if you read this, tell everybody that I am sorry that I rated only with 10 , but IMDb vote drop-down menu has only ten stars.There should be added few more for this serial.Plot is full of turnovers, acting is magnificent, and I just cant wait next season. 

To be clear, I am not trying to pretend that I am movie expert, or critic, and this is my first review ever, but I simply felt that I must share my emotions with whole world.From acting to music, everything is so perfect, that I couldn't understand, why, why this team didn't get Nobel prize for movie chemistry. Not, TV, I am talking about movie chemistry. This is pure art for me. I can not write on English what I feel on Serbian, but those words are common: respect, continue, love. P.S. Now, I have one more wish in my life, to meet acting team from B.B. to pay them personal respect.
