I saw this on the wall at the video store so many times. I even picked it up a few times, but always moved on to something else. I finally one day brought the first season home for my wife and I to watch. We were hooked! This is our favorite show now. The word needs to get out about this show because it is the best show on TV right now and no one has heard of it. If you haven't watched this show, do yourself a favor. There are some slow moments in the first season, but it all pays off. It seems like such a strange premise, man cooking meth with some flunkie kid he use to teach in high school, but somehow they pull it off. The complexity of the story is compelling and the acting is spectacular. Its starting to seem like there are better shows on the cable channels than network TV now. This show is up there with Rescue Me for any you FX fans out there.
