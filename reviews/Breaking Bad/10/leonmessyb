NEVER written a review before this but this show was worth the exception. 

I put off watching this show for SO long as I didn't want to get caught in the hype. So many people were talking about it and after watching it, I see perfectly why. The wittiness, subtle comedic value, the attention to detail, the character build up, the story development, the cinematography, the camera angles. I could go on and on. The writers did a flawless job. Absolutely love this show and 10 put of 10 is entirely deserved!!!
