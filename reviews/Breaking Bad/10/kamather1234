You're literally on the edge of your seat throughout the ENTIRE 5 seasons. I watched the whole series in just 3 weeks because it was so addictive. The whole thing is very interesting. Have you ever heard of a story like this before assuming you've read what it is about. A normal boring middle-aged high school teacher who breaks bad into crazy chemical genius? It gets harder and harder to sympathize with Walt as the series continues but you just can't help but like Walt?!?!? I think it's the thrill of watching it and thinking what if I could do it because we relate with the character in so many ways yet we would never do it. JESSE PINKMAN, thank the lord Vince didn't kill him off because just watch and see Aaron Paul's phenomenal acting. 

Overall, wow. just wow. The entire series is just a piece of television greatness and I'm sure it will be up in the likes of the twilight zone in many years to come.

It will be the best TV show you have ever watched.
