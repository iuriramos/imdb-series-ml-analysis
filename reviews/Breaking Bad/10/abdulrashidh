To be honest this show has a very boring and dragging on first season. But you must watch this as it is very important to the show. As soon as season 2 starts THIS SHOW IS AS ADDICTING AS IT CAN GET. A mix of drama , action and some suspense. This show is very intriguing and can get you confused at times with some of Walters Bold decisions , that You begin to understand later on in the show. Walter is a very unpredictable character as well as the show is. I highly recommend you watch this , well worth the watch. GREAT SHOW. If you are wondering "why I decided to continue watching after season 1 ? " I decided to keep watching because I was told by a friend that it evades its slow paced first season and becomes a lot more interesting and intense.
