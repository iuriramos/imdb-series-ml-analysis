My Friend recommended me this TV series, So i decided to watch it. The starting two seasons is just okey.But the real thrill began in the 3rd season .And I finally was eager to watch the next episode after finishing one.

This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines.

now Em fan of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul (yoo!!)..i love this TV Show!
