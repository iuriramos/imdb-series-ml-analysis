Greetings from Lithuania.

What can i say about this show that hasn't been said before. Not much, but here it is. If you haven't seen it yet, do your self a favor and watch, because it's a magnificent series from start to finish. Probably the best accomplished show ever. Not overlong, 5 seasons, in a terrific shape start till end. Everything in this show clicks on highest cylinders, and i mean everything. Acting, writing, directing are brilliant, and what a cinematography - thanks to it you won't feel you are watching a TV show, it's a world itself. Unforgettable characters, villains, deaths, twists (not overwritten!) - it hardly gets better than this. Yes, it has one (just one) weak episode (Fly), of course not by the guilt of creators but just producers and yet they managed to create something out of nothing. 

Overall, if you like watching / don't like watching TV shows in general, "Breaking Bad" is an almost universal entrainment which you will never forget.
