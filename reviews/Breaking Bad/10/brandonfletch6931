Breaking Bad is without a doubt the greatest show to ever be created. The performances by all actors are amazing, but especially by Cranston and Paul. At the start of the show Cranston is great as the chemistry genius who not only is diagnosed with cancer but has a teenage son and a wife to take care of. This leaves Walt to resort to cooking the worlds greatest crystal meth. This show from the start shows Walter white's transformation from this chemistry teacher, to the most powerful drug dealer in New Mexico, if not more. Paul goes through a transformation of his own through this troubled slacker in his twenties, to a broken man at the end of the show. The writing of the show is amazing, and the creator, Vince Gilligan has made a masterpiece through the basic story line, to the completely detailed moments throughout the show. To keep this short, whether it be the amazing writing or acting, this show has made an impact on many, and will never be forgotten.

Rating: 9.9/10
