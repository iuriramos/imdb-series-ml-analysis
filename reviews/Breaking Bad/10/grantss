Brilliant - one of the greatest drama series of all time.

Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a chemistry teach, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. By chance he runs into a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul), who is now a crystal meth dealer. This gives him an idea on how to pay for his medical bills and provide for his family upon his death...

Fantastic series. Starts innocently enough and builds tension and momentum with every episode. So many dangers and hurdles in his path - from small time hoodlums to drug lords, his wife, plus Walter's own brother is a DEA agent!

Also has some great comedic moments (largely provided by Jesse Pinkman) but these become fewer and further between the more into the series you get, as it becomes darker the more you go along.

Great ending, one of the most iconic and poetic in TV history.

Great work from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. Good support from Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Jonathan Banks and Bob Odenkirk.
