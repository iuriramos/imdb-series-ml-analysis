When I watch this show I can't even believe what I am looking at. When it comes too Walt killing two drug dealers and poisoning a kid to save his own skin you still want to root for him. In the beginning he is just a simple guy then gets lung cancer and he is suddenly awake and turns into one of the most bad ass TV characters ever! Breaking bad I wish you were still on TV the most missed TV series. You know this show is was so good that the people of New Mexico have a funeral for Walter White and everyone in the city attends to it. The finale was so explosive I was at the edge of my seat the whole way through, the best TV show finale I have ever seen.
