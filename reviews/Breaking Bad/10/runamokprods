What can be said about this spectacular saga that hasn't been said before? One of the very few series that competes with the best films in history for cinematic storytelling. Like a great novel slowly unfolding, it's funny, heartbreaking, incredibly tense, deeply disturbing. 

A nebbishy high-school science teacher finds he has lung cancer, so becomes a meth dealer to make money for his family before his death. Often visually stunning, with a breathtaking performance by Brian Cranston in the lead, and great work from all the supporting roles, this portrait of a man's decent into hell couldn't be much better, and it just grows darker and more disturbing each year. 

In a way, thematically it recalls "The Godfather I and II" in how that epic charts Michael's journey from innocence to darkness, along with the moral murkiness of the American drive for money and success - how we lose ourselves, so that succeeding and having ever more becomes an end in itself for which we will pay any price, rather than a route to happiness, trapping us in a game we can never win.

Kudos too, to creator Vince Gilligan to have the courage to end the show at just the right time rather than string it out past where the story would bear. It may take a few episodes to get into, but you owe it to yourself to try. This is powerful, important and utterly enthralling stuff.
