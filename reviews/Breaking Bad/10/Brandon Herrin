Hands-down the best acting I have ever seen in a TV drama series. Each actor and actress plays their role terrifically and really achieves exactly what the creators wanted each on of them to achieve. That is to make the viewers fall in love with the cast. The show also does an extremely stellar job in grabbing the viewers, pulling them in, and never, I say never letting them go! Closely, but better in my opinion, resembles The Walking Dead. I honestly cannot think of an episode that didn't end making me immediately want to jump into the next episode. In my opinion, that is exactly what a TV drama is supposed to do. Breaking Bad is dramatic, suspenseful perfection. 10/10!
