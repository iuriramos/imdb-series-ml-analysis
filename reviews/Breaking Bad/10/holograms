I know my review will get lost in the shuffle of the hundreds that have already been posted, but I had to wade in and give my two thumbs up for this epic show. It's fabulously written, directed, produced, and acted. The character development is simply stunning, seizing you by the heart and pulling you right in, leaving you wanting to binge watch episode after episode. The tense action, real-life drama of family, and quirky humor all mesh together so well that you will feel that you know the characters as true as the real world. The show truly is the best one ever made.

Therefore, if you are one of the few who haven't seen Breaking Bad, let me just say that every other show that you choose to watch besides this one (i.e. you keep putting it off) is a lesser show by every measure, for the production quality, acting, and plots are second to none. I highly suggest with no reservation that if you have not seen this, then shame on you. Go seek immediate redemption by starting Breaking Bad now! You will not be disappointed.
