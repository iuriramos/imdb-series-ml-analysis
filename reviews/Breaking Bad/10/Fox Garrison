This is a great show. First of all the look of the show is just absolutely outstanding. It has this greenish-yellow tint to it that makes the desert scenes all the more gritty and hot. You can really feel the heat from those scenes. The acting is without question movie-quality. In fact, the whole show has this movie feel that can only be described as a mini-movie for TV (not a TV movie though). I love the fact the show perpetuates drama in the most ordinary circumstances. Only The Sopranos came close to the balance that Breaking Bad has with its story lines. Altogether, Breaking Bad is the next greatest thing to Meth!
