Definitely my all time favorite TV-series. It's all you want composed in to one show, it's tragic, extremely full of suspense, has a great plot and is full of dark humor. The characters are spot on, everyone really suits their character and I feel like the show in general is just really raw. If a character feels like crap they look like crap, so there's no excessive make-up and expensive houses, it's just realistic and that makes it so much better as it's easier for the viewer to relate even if the story isn't something anyone relates to at all unless you're Walter White. It's just these small things that you see yourself or someone you know in, because most of what's in this show is things that could happen in real life, which you don't see very often in TV-series.

I've probably recommended Breaking Bad to everyone I know, and I will continue to do so. Everyone who hasn't watched it has missed something exceptionally great. It kind of ruins your hope of ever finding one of those flawless shows that you just can't stop watching, because nothing is as good as Breaking Bad. You need it in your life. 

Watch it, you will not regret it.
