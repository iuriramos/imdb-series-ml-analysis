I can say this with utmost faith that there will never be another show like Breaking Bad. It is an incredible piece of art work that shows complex human relationships, how far a man's love for his family take him? How does an under-achiever handle his brilliance? Money, greed , power, addiction and crystal meth !! Breaking bad has it all!!!

And it gives us one of the greatest and complex characters of all time ( same at the level of the Joker of the Dark knight) . Heisenberg.

Yeah, remember this name, because once you start watching breaking bad, you will not forget it!

Bryan Cranston as Walter white is brilliant, Aaron Paul as Jesse Pink Man is stunning as well as hilarious.

So , those who have still not watched this greatest series of all time. Please do yourself a favor. And remember " Its all in the Chemistry"!!
