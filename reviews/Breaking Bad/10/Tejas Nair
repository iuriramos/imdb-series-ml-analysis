I am not into Television series. This was my first attempt and boy, did it blow my mind!

Every single factor about Breaking Bad is so fine and original and startling, I was addicted to it and still am. I could, if time permits, watch all episodes again and again. That is why the 100%, because this show can even make the most boring person find a reason to get smart.

With so much swag, the characters are well-written. Bryan Cranston is simply outstanding. Supporting cast is brilliant and the airs they carry with the portrayals is so charming, it is very hard to believe it is fiction. Aaron Paul's facial expressions, Dean Norris' funny physique and his laugh snorts, Anna Gunn's OMG emotions & her beauty are all simply amazing. RJ Mitte is fantastic.

Now, for the story, it is gold and this one shines, too. Every episode reveals something new about the chemistry involved in cooking crystal-drug, Walter White's familial problems and all that comes along. The little to grave dangerous adventures the two main characters set on towards the end of Season 1 is mind-boggling. And with the high- level of crime involved... I mean all sorts of crimes... the boldness overflows threshold and that is what works here!

The music, the cinematography, the direction & the cast performance together puts up to the startling birth & departure of a very good TV series. "Better Call Saul" will be good, eh?

BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended! And if you are planning to start a new series to watch, make it Breaking Bad! This is some serious entertainment stuff!
