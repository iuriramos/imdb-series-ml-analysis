Visiting IMDb forever now, but for the first time felt need to register and write something. So proud to brag around how I watched pilot episode on it's premier night, not having a clue what is it about beforehand, got hooked up on it and watched almost every episode on it's premier night including the last one. Comparison to any other contemporary TV series ( of any genre) seems simply unfair, that how much better BB is. 'Sopranos' comes close to it, except it was just new approach to old good mafia stories. BB was (uh, 'was'!) original piece on so many levels, surprising in it's story line, characters build up, shooting, cinematography and you name the rest. And you can tell it was a labor of great love, from it's creator, writers, actors and others. The best judge of all, time, will give it it's stamp one day, but for now it stands tall, head and shoulders above anything I have seen in last10-15 years. It wasn't perfect all the way, but never stumbled either,amazing for 62 episodes long show. No idea when or who is going to make something this impactful, but I am not getting my hopes high
