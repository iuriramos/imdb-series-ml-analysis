Television just does not get any better than this. Start with episode one and do not turn your head away for even a moment. Having probably heard everything that has already been said about "Breaking Bad", all I can say is it will blow your mind. The writing is to perfection, the actors and casting are right on and the suspense leaves you biting your fingernails and waiting around for the next episode in a state of shock. This storyline runs to perfection like a finely tuned engine or musical instrument and not a beat is missed. It seems selfish for the creators to be so selfish and end the series this year! Hey guys, how about, "Breaking Bad, The Movie" as a real final finale! Bring Heisenberg to the big screen!
