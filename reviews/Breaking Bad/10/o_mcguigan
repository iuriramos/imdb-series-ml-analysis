I must admit, I was weary about watching this at first but others I trust told me I need to watch it. Since the first episode I am hooked. Having lost my father to Cancer I find it hard to watch this but the emotional roller coaster has been one hell of a ride. This story is raw, gritty and compelling. Acting is expertly done and Bryan Cranston is my true hero. He brought his extensive career and it really shows. I can pick no fault with any aspect of it so I wont even try criticize. If you are reading this because you want to know if its worth watching then stop right here and just watch it. If you are reading this for any other reason then know that I love this title and everything about it.
