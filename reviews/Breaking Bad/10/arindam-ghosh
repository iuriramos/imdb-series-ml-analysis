This is an outstanding piece of work.The direction, the screen play , actors everything is just amazing.Every episode was just great and not a single wrong chord was stuck.To be glued to it is an under statement from my part.

The climax , the way characters have been sketched was just mind blowing.I was sad that it ended but every good thing comes to an end and that was the best part of the show that it was not stretched.It was such a great end to the show.

In today's world there are so many form of entertainment and you have so many choices.Why do i watch a TV show and what makes me write a review for that show? Because I have never seen something like this. May be I have seen less !
