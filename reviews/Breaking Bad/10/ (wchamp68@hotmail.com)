I have been a fan of this show since it started. For many years I thought that "Homicide: Life on the Street" was the best and grittiest crime drama I'd ever seen - until "Breaking Bad" appeared. The acting and writing has been terrific from season one right up to now. Bryan Cranston just stuns me, because I still remember him as the moronic father in "Malcolm in the Middle." However, the entire cast is great. Walter White's transformation over the years is one of the best character developments I've ever seen in more than fifty years of watching TV. The intensity of the show is such that I wind up watching it on demand because my wife can't deal with the ruthlessness of the principal characters, and the basic theme. It is well worth the day's wait to catch it the next day. I will be sorry to see one of television's all-time great shows, of any format, wind up after this season.
