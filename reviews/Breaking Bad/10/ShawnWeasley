This show is the worst. Boring, stagnant cinematography. Horribly predictable, mundane writing. Worst casting ever assembled. Unbelievably irrelevant, soulless soundtrack. By-the-book editing. Boring subject matter. 

I feel as though at times, RL STINE was capable of producing more suspenseful material. This series is the television equivalent of some of the early works of Chad Kroeger, and his friends at Nickelback. 

But none of that's true. 

You've never been told a tighter story, and you'll never see a better show. Watch it. Watch it again. I don't care what season you got to, finish it. And sorry if you genuinely enjoy the likes of Nickelback. I'm really, very sorry for you.

10/10.
