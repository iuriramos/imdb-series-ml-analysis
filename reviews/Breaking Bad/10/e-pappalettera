The sudden change of a common man. Walter White, placid high school teacher, was taken ill with an incurable disease. Turns out not to have anything to lose by becoming a drug dealer to ensure a bright future for his family.

Breaking Bad is without a doubt the most realistic, vivid, perfectly executed, psychedelic, brilliant, Mind Blowing, Stunning Comedy-Drama Series ever!!! It beats even Twin Peaks and I am a huge D.Lynch fan imagine that! Bryan Cranston is a hell of an actor, he deserves to be crowned in the Hollywood firmament and Vince Gilligan is a visionary genius. Masterpiece.
