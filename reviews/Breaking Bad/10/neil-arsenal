If I like a show I'll watch 2 or 3 episodes on the spin. With this I somehow have gone through 3 full series in three days! I had work the next morning and my wife had to call me to bed at 2.00am. I didn't realise how long I had been watching it.

The acting is brilliant, the way the show 'teases' you with images you just know are going to make sense sometime is brilliant.

The humour is very dark in the early seasons and it is a thriller first and foremost, but you will laugh out loud on occasion.

As a Brit I have to say some of the US series are very overrated but this one isn't.

The best thing about BB is that it's completely unpredictable. As soon as you try and second guess it, it takes you somewhere else. To an even better place. Something only brilliant writing can do.

The finale of Season 4 almost made me cry. Not because it was particularly sad in any way...but because it was so brilliant. I think I was a bit sad as I knew I would probably never see something so good again.

The good news is Season 5 (the final season) is outstanding too (at the 7th episode point).

Get yourself the complete set and sit down and prepare to curse eating, bowel movements and sleeping as they stop you on your BB marathon.

If I could have my memory erased I would remove BB from my mind so I could start again.

I am so jealous of you if you are about to start watching Season 1 for the first time.
