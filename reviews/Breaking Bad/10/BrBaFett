I watched the whole series, and I still watch it; can't stop no matter how hard I try to stop thinking about it. But easily its hands-down the best show I've ever seen. But I more than recommend it, you have to watch this show before you die. Its so good, that you can't spoil it--you have to see it to believe it. The acting is so good, that its super believable--everyone puts 100% love and effort into making each second of it. But its not just the acting and effort. It is even artistic in every way, and haven't seen as much art in any movie or TV show in my life, since the art in this is beautiful and unbelievable; touched up with the perfect songs for each scene.
