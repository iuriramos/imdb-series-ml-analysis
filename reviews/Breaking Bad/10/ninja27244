Amazing.... It has a different plot after the end of the second season. But without spoiling it, this show begins with the tale of a man's needs making him desperate. It later focuses on ambition and a mans desire to rule and leave behind a statue for all to glorify. The paradox is, no matter how much the writers seemingly antagonize the main characters, the audience always cheers for the owners of drug cartels and murderers. Season two is conclusive and a cliff hanger at the same time. There are few television series like this. I have not enjoyed a show enough to tune in on since Seinfeld and Friends. You will love this so long you don't give up during the first few episodes before an actual plot develops.
