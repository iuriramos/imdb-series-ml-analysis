Seldom, if ever, does a simple television show reach and exploit the dramatic heights and potential of its medium. 

It does this using two of the most unlikely and unassuming individuals in the business to carry across to the viewers their journey; to trust in them the goal of making that journey worth following. 

Breaking Bad does that. The writing is simple and powerful; written in both detailed and broad strokes. Nothing is said without deep meaning behind it. The most simple and innocuous interactions have symbolic meaning. You won't be cheated.

It seems it would be nearly impossible for any age or gender to watch this show without feeling its theme in their bones; pertinent to them. 

Life, death, ultimate meaning ... right, wrong. Love, lies, manipulation .. and power. 

The cinematography is worth watching the series alone for. It's crystal clear, stunning Western portraits ... extended shots, absolute beauty to match absolute corruption.

Nothing means anything without characters who are memorable. We care deeply about these characters: Particularly the two leads, Walter and Jessie. I don't think anybody would/could have imagined the evolution Walter's character was capable of, let alone that of Jessie's. It's not a show that's been dragged out for money, it's not a show that was cut short. It's just right.

Seldom do you see this level of beauty through this medium. It transcends its medium. Would it be too much to ask for a movie ... to follow the series? If not, I will not complain. I'll be re-watching the show for years to come.

Masterpiece.
