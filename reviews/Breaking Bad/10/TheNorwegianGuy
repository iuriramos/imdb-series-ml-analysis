I expect a lot from a TV-show to give it a 10/10-rating. However, this is one of those few TV-gems that deserves it. I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone, so I'll try to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible. 

A few years ago, a friend of mine told me about this show. This was just after the second season had aired. I didn't really know what to expect when I started watching the pilot, but after 10 minutes I was already hooked! Every episode of Breaking Bad leaves you hungry for more. The suspense(?) continues throughout the series, and even though there are "slower" episodes here and there, you won't get bored. 

One of the aspects I like most about Breaking Bad, is Walters struggle to keep living his double-life. When he walks out the door, he's a meth- cook, but at house he is a dad and husband. Bryan Cranston is amazing as Walter White, but also Aaron Paul(Jessie) and most of the other actors are incredible in their roles.

Breaking Bad is without doubt my favorite TV-show. In my opinion, TV can't be better than this. Check it out. You won't be disappointed :)
