A true phenomenon. Just finished watching this masterpiece. I think it deserves every accolade going including an Oscar. Hard to describe how one feels after the last and final episode finished. The writing, the acting, the directing, the skill, the list goes on.. how on earth can anyone top this I don't know!!!! LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!!!!

The baddies were really bad. The actors top class each and everyone of them even the Baby acted on cue! The series took you on a roller coaster journey. Just as you thought you had it figured out it smacked you with something else. 

Where do we go from here? I would have liked to have known what happens to the characters afterwards. Just a few loose ends.
