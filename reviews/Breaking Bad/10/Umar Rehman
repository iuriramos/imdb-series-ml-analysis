I hadn't heard of this TV show until pretty recently and have already finished it. It was an absolutely amazing show and its such a shame it ended, in fact I think it is the best TV show ever to have been made (and I consider myself a pretty harsh critic).

This show has is amazingly entertaining through the combination of a breath taking story with a sense of authenticity in all the little details to the major plot line, so all in all you will be simply astounded with the execution of such a eccentric chain of events that transpires through the entire show.

In one sentence Breaking Bad is why the television was invented, you simply cannot watch one episode without having that addictive sensation that forces you to sit for hours watching every episode in every season.
