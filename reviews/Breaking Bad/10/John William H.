Breaking Bad is one of the best, most memorable and quirkiest shows to air in this day and age. Bryan Cranston plays Walter White, a stressed-out and tetchy school teacher and father of a cerebral-palsy-diagnosed son, who's struggling to keep his family's life secure. On top of that, his wife Skyler White is expecting a baby. His life gets all the more chaotic when he discovers that he has lung cancer, and he won't take sh!t from anyone anymore. Walter teams up with a former pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman, to cook crystal meth and secure his family's future. Walter breaks bad, and he never goes back.

Breaking Bad is the most amazing kind of television show being made; overarching stories and character subtexts that are IMPORTANT in the grand scheme of the series, characters and all. Breaking Bad is hilarious, shocking, and lovingly original take on drug-culture and the thugs living in and around it. The characters are amazing; not just Walter, but Hank Schrader and Saul Goodman are standout characters in themselves, one being a morally-complicated police officer and the other a sleazy but street-smart lawyer. And let's not even get started with Mike Ehrmantraut: the 'clean-up' man of the show who's got his eye on you... and 'Gus'.

Vince Gilligan has cooked the perfect substance: a show so pure and full of powerful beats that many television shows envy it for its genius arcs and subtle character motivations slowly paying off over the course of the show. I'd personally want to shake hands with him and thank him for giving the world such an entertaining and smart show littered with great characters.

Breaking Bad has broken so many barriers in the world of television that all the major networks hoping to emulate the success of this crystal meth gem; and they owe it to Vince Gilligan's black-comedy crime-drama magnum opus.

Watch this show. For television lovers you owe yourself this series, if you haven't seen it already!
