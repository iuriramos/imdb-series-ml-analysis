For at least a year I had people coming up to me and trying to talk about Breaking Bad. I said yeah yeah, sounds great but it's not a pay channel - therefore there's no nudity, gore and F bombs. Not for me. Boy, was I wrong. 

This show is so good you don't mind the slight censorship. There's enough swearing, chicks and blood to satisfy you. We all know that Bryan Cranston knocked his role out of the park, but he's not the only one. I loved his brother in law and Aaron Paul was really, really good. Jonathan Banks was super as well. 

This is the only show where I can say that I got a big kick out of every single episode. It's like the writers know what you want to see and they bring it every time. Not too much, not too little, just the perfect pacing for a story. I was sorry to see it end.
