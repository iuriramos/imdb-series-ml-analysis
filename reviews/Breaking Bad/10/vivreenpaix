It was one of those Netflix nights when my friend suggested a show called Breaking Bad. Reading the description, I did not know what my eyes were about to witness. I was thinking to myself, "A show about a chemistry teacher who finds out he has cancer... and becomes a drug dealer?" We watched the first episode and I thought it was great, but it was awhile before I got back to it... but once I took the time to show that first episode to my boyfriend, we proceeded to watch the next episode. 

It was at the end of that second episode when we looked at each other wide-eyed. I was about to utilize the majority of my time watching this show, unable to deny watching the next episode... then the next... then the next... 

This show defines pure genius. Not only is every actor on this show PERFECTION at playing their characters, but the story will blow your mind with each and every tear jerking, heart pounding episode. You will never see what's coming. And you'll definitely never know who's going to break bad next - or be the victim. 

No, this show isn't just about a chemistry teacher who finds out he has cancer who becomes a meth dealing legend. It's three episodes away from being the end - and I feel that we'll all find our own meaning for this work of art. You'll cry. You'll laugh. You'll feel the pain of all the characters at once - and in the end, you'll probably be rooting for someone you thought you'd never root for. 

So if you're having one of those Netflix nights, don't scroll past Breaking Bad. I can assure you'll be hooked after the end of the first episode, if not sooner. If I could rate this more than 10, I would because it's worthy of more than you can imagine.
