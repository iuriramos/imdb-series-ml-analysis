Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show or movie I have watched to date, and this is coming from a guy who 1) has yet to hook into any other TV show, and 2) has watched a lot of great movies.

The storyline, the directing, the script, the characters, the acting performances and the cinematography are just stunning.

The only blip is probably the second half of Season 5, which I think was too sped up compared to the first 4.5 seasons. That aside, it is still a masterpiece.

Thank you to everyone behind Breaking Bad for making me realise the possibilities of TV shows. It was a privilege to have watched Breaking Bad.
