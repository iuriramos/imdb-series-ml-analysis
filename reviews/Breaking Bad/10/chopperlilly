Cannot believe there are people on this review board giving BB 9 or 8 stars!! There is nothing in all my 36 years on earth that has ever compared to this show. It will go down in history as the best thing to ever hit the small or big screen. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are two of the greatest actors on TV. Every actor on this show is top quality. Every character is relevant to the story and each character develops as the show continues. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, the writers/producers throw in just a touch of comedy to break up the intensity, in the form of Saul Goodman. Pure brilliance. There is absolutely nothing that can be added or taken away to improve this show, as perfection cannot be improved on. After a few great TV series in the nineties, I had almost lost interest in TV dramas (and comedies) since then, then BB came along - this show is completely on another level, it's the Holy Grail of TV. My only criticism is that's all down hill from here - nothing will better or even equal this in our lifetime, nothing.
