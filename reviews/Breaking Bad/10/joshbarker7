Breaking Bad is by far one of the best TV shows I have ever seen or ever will see. Just reading the plot is enough to get you intrigued;an underachieving Chemistry genius turned high school teacher learns about his cancer diagnosis and so becomes a CRYSTAL METH COOK!? I had just had to watch this, and the pilot episode did not disappoint.

Although the pilot episode is a fantastic introduction to the show, the First Season consisting of 7 episodes is rather quite slow going at first but this is not necessarily a bad thing, as it gives a little insight into every character which is completely necessary when you take into account that the main character - Walter White (played superbly by Bryan Cranston) has a brother-in-law whom is a DEA Agent and quite frankly - his worst enemy. 

The seasons proceeding the first one get better and better and at the end of every season you will just not think it is logically possible for this show to get any better! But it does, and by the time you start Season 5 it becomes almost part of your life this show as the character development is better than I have seen in any other show! The once quiet high school teacher Walt has become something more than just a Crystal Meth cooker, with him following in the boots of his drug dealing alter ego - "Heisenberg". You can just never know what to expect with this show.

The acting is also very good and I couldn't believe it when I read on IMDb that Aaron Paul (who plays Jesse - Walt's partner in crime) was lined up to be killed off after the first season. The show would just not be the same without him. 

If you haven't seen this show already, I suggest you do. And quick.

All Hail The King!
