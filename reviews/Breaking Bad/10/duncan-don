Thank you, thank you, thank you to the makers of Breaking Bad for giving us an ending that was completely satisfying (screw you Sopranos, Dexter, Seinfeld etc.).

Thank you for not staying to long. You never made crap just because you could make money by staying on the air for longer.

Thank you for starting out as a extremely good show and only get better as it went along.

This show was like reading great literature. The story was great, but so much was going on on different levels.

May be the greatest work of art ever on TV.
