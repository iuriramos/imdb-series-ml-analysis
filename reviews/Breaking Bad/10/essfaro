I got to say this is the best series i've ever seen.... I gotta like much the roles of Walter and Jesse and etc... This for me is true actors... This can be way more addictive then a random movie.... If i would classify it from 0-10 ? i give a 10 ! I think this has to be really hard making a series like this and not touching a dime...... Looks like i already think like you guys...... It's a very creative story and i can't wait to see the next episode...... Keep up the good work boys and girls, you all will be a good reference for me...... it's very recommendable.... XD.... heads up i'm no pot head as simple as that, but i gotta love the dedication..... :)
