The greatest! That is the word to describe this TV series. I can't imagine, now, the filmography without this golden movie. 5 season, 5 stars, 5 time the best! I really want Gilligan to continue the story. Great thanks to the producer! "Keep calm And Watch Breaking Bad" Yooooooooo !!! Please give me some alternative of TV series, at least as good as Breaking Bad. I try The Wire but is not so deeply attractive. Recently i saw Dexter. Great! Very good, very psyho! Oh! I almost forgot! Please include Jesse Ã®n Better call Saul. He is the salt from the food! I hope you will think about it and give us a good chance to saw again that funny guy.
