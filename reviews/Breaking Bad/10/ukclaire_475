I write this review with a heavy heart! Why? Breaking Bad comes to an end in two days! So what has Breaking Bad got to offer you? Five seasons of complete and utter brilliance that's what! Pre Breaking Bad I enjoyed American TV series such as Dexter, The Walking Dead, Supernatural, American Horror Story and True Blood. Breaking Bad to me (I thought) would not satisfy my love for crime/horror/blood and guts! How wrong was I?? Don't get my wrong I still love all the aforementioned TV shows but Breaking Bad is on a completely different level! The character development is fantastic: you literally go from loving Walt to hating his guts!! Then without warning you go back to the original feelings of warmth towards him (see penultimate episode of season 5) Enter the world of Breaking Bad knowing that once you've stepped in: you'll never EVER want to leave! All the characters are fantastic, from Walt, Jesse, Mike, Saul, Syler, Hank, Marie, Walt Junior, Gus I could go on and on and on!! They are all so bloody brilliant!! What a clever show! Your heart will race, you'll scream at the TV, you'll cover your eyes, your mouth will hang open in awe - there is no other show like Breaking Bad and I am so sad we have to say goodbye! I am on my THIRD viewing of the seasons now and I still love it as much as I did the first time!! Cranston and Paul thank you for your brilliance and continue with the good work. Two words WATCH IT!!!
