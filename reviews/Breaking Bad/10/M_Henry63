I love breaking bad, its a very great show showing us how life can transform a good person and turn him into a villain. When Walter had just entered the meth business all he wanted was to get enough money to take care of his family after he dies, but as the show goes on we see him transform into a greedy person who wants more money and power and will stop at nothing until he gets what he wants. At certain points when every one wants to get out of the criminal life and go back to living normally for example when Jesse and Mike decided to leave, Walter tries to convince Jesse to keep on working with him even after he has made enough money to support his family. All this just shows us how greedy Walter is for power. According to me i think he has gone too far and it is too late to go back to having a normal life with his family and i probably think the show might not in his favor
