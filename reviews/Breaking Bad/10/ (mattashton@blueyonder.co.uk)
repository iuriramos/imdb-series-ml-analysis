The sign of a good actor is the ability to be completely believable in the part they are playing.

Brian Cranston played the manic Hal in 'Malcolm in the Middle' a role that was likable but not outstanding by any means.

'Breaking Bad' is a revelation, it's like watching a butterfly emerge from a chrysalis, Brian Cranston is just brilliant as Walter White, he plays an over qualified chemistry teacher who discovers that he has cancer. This discovery completely changes his perspective on life, the realisation that his mediocre life could soon be over and he has little to show for it triggers a change in life that simply leads from one amazing drama to another.

Crystal meth is not something that should be taken on lightly in any drama, happily this is not the case here, and the program tackles these issues admirably. It shows the ups and downs of dealing, the unsavoury characters who Walter meats along his journey. What makes this show different is that it doesn't glamorise drugs; it does show what a human being is capable of put into various circumstances.

'Breaking Bad' is a very dark comedy; some of the light relief is give by Cranston and more especially from his co-star Aaron Paul who plays the small time drug dealer who Walter taught at school. Their relationship starts out as one of mutual benefit and over the first season blossoms to one of two people who know each other's secrets and then kinship.

This program as I said is a dark comedy, but don't let that fool you in any way, it is also very hard hitting, there are scenes of extreme violence which are not for those of a squeamish disposition. Then there are the complications of family life and all the realities of a cancer sufferer.

This program is unique in a world of knock off's and remakes; this is definitely NOT chewing gum for the brain and requires the viewer to pay attention.

Having watched the first season I was spellbound and couldn't wait to watch each episode to see where this drama would take us, I am happy to report having watched the first three episodes of the second season that this is no flash in the pan, the second season is starting out as good as the first season and long may it continue.
