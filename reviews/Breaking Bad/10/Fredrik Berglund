I finished watching breaking bad a few days ago and i can't stop thinking about how great it was. One of the many things i liked about this show was the character development, i really got into the main ones. Other factors making the show the best: The acting, the length of it, right amount of surprises and the final scene. There couldn't be a better ending in my opinion. 

This site won't allow me to submit this review unless it contains at least 10 rows... wait a minute, i just realized that i've fulfilled that demand now... Wait another minute, it said 10 rows of text! Okey i recommend this TV show to everyone from the age of 12-99. There!
