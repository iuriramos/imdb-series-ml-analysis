The writing is nearly flawless, and the acting is very good. Simply the best show on TV right now. Period. For years, I have declared my favourite show ever to be The Sopranos, and it still could be.... but this one has to be very close. Most shows seem to take you down paths that never seem to go anywhere, and you are always left with questions unanswered. When all is done, this one may also have questions, but so far, the writing has been complete. My only complaints are that we had to wait so long to see the final season, and that the writers are stopping at only 6 seasons - probably could have gone for at least 1 more...
