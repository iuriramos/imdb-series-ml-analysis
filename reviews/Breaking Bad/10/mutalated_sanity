I'll tell you now, if you start with episode one, you won't be able to stop, it will just sink your whole day away. Absolutely amazing show, great acting and superb story. Prepare for a fantastic ride! I started watching the show when season 5 began. And within the start of season 5 episode one, I was caught up and watching episode five on TV. I was hooked from start to finish. The acting all the way through the show was great. Right up to the very end of the show I guarantee you will be craving more and more and never want it to end, but sadly, every show has to end at some point and instead of drawing it out and possibly making the story become boring and dull they finished it with an absolute perfect finale. Thank you so much Breaking Bad for giving me some great memories due to watching your show.
