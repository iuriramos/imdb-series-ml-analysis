It's the best! I really liked it from the beginning but the end is amazing. Everyone should watch BB and i also thing many things in BB is how it could work with things like this so I would say it's realistic as well. I would say without spoiling anything that I change my minds about how I would end in every season. But I think one of the reasons I like it so much is how it ends. It has a good ending part. If a take Prison Break for an example I didn't like the end of it because it's not how it should end but BB isn't how it should end as well but it's still a really good end because it has to end sometimes or it just going to be a bad end anyway.
