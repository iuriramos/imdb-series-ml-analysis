I won't get into the debate about "best" show ever, b/c there's no such thing, but it's certainly my FAVORITE show ever, and everything in it is perfect for my sensibilities. Cranston as Walt is manic and focused at the same time. Jesse Pinkman's a reasonable yet amoral character, drifting through life complaining about the things he himself is the cause of. Directing is top notch consistently while you can still spot the stylistic differences of various people behind the camera, and the variety of villains is each given their own aesthetic. The most under- appreciated part of that aesthetic IMO is the color choice, harsh reds and yellows and a hideous New Mexico bleak background.

Simply put I love everything about this show, enough that I even made this art for it with my favorite quotes.
