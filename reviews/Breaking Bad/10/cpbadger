No matter what kind of shows your into, I would highly recommend this show. All of my friends finished watching this years ago and said I should watch it. I never really have time for shows but oh boy, I won't regret taking the time to watch this masterpiece. It really is one of the most brilliant, well thought out scripts in the history of television. Every character/actor does a great job as well. I totally disagree with the people saying it started out slow (some of my friends also said the same) I thought it started with a bang right away and you just knew there were gonna be twists and turns throughout the show. another thing I like was almost every character that I didn't really like at first, came around for me. For example Jesse, mike, and Saul. Skyler was prob my least favorite but she was still great at her role. However my favorite thing about the show is that 1) every episode, every season gets better. And 2) Walt just continued to blow me away (especially in the final season) by how smart he was and how he always seemed to have an answer or a plan for everything. It was like he knew it was gonna happen (of course it's a show but his character was portrayed as a very knowledgeable man). All in all, this show will go down in the books, at least for me it will. It truly had everything, even gave me a few laughs here and there. Also teaches a lesson to some extent. Tell your friends to tell there friends that they need to watch this show!
