Here's how to enjoy this to the maximum extent; 1,Sign up for Netflix one month free. 2.Visit the local hospital and steal a supply of liquid food with an intravenous drip 3. Get a trained professional to hook you up in the basement 4. unplug the phone 5.Start from the very first episode and don't leave until you're up to 2012 ('cos that's as far as it goes on Netflix) 6. Have your wife check in on you from time to time over the next three days to change the drip and give you a sponge bath. 7.prepare yourself to be a changed person when you re-enter society.

Quite simply one of the best series I have ever seen; acting superb on all fronts , plot and scripting brilliant, suspense tingling, scenery haunting. Can this really be the same guy we saw as a dentist on Seinfeld so many years ago? It's amazing how the absence of any sort of commercial break makes a show so much more enjoyable. You know maybe I can use Netflix to watch the Kardashians and Total Divas or even Jersey Shore.. I my have misjudged them just because of the intrusive advertisements... and then I woke up!
