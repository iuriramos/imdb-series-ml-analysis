Breaking Bad isn't just a show, it's a catharsis. When I first saw Br. Ba. I was like little children at Christmas morning; I can't wait for the next event. First season was a slowly but impressive beginning, and every season was a little bit more a little bit more insane. But what makes this series awesome? The actors. Bryan Cranston's forming is inimitable. I think Walter White's character development is the greatest transfiguration on the TV screen we have ever seen. The reason why I'm saying this, is the scene from the end when Walter tells Skyler that he maked methamphetamine because he liked it, is the most shocking scene and it changes the meaning of the series. We all believed Walter did everything for save his family and keep them safe, but in the end we got a beat on our chest which makes the whole show more fantastic. Obviously this is just one example, but maybe the biggest revolution. Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is also a great choice I think all of us hated on him until the end of the show. He was a moron in my opinion, but he could beat the sickness (drug-addiction) and found people who are important for him. Jesse made choices which are questionable and non-sense that's one of the reasons why I didn't like him. And we've got awesome supporting actors like Gus Fink (Giancarlo Esposito), Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) and many more who make the show even better. Actually I'm trying to write down every single points which describe the hugeness of Breaking Bad but it's impossible. If you have not watched, I recommend it for everyone It'll blow your mind I promise.
