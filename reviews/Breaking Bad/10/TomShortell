Before starting this show I went in with the impression that a lot of the people I know did. It didn't look very good personally and it just looked boring through the trailer of season 1. After a few episodes in to the series boy was I sure wrong. I was already recommending it to others.

There will never be a show that generally made me shake and pause to breathe. The plot twist are actually incredible and its such a short storyline to expand 'Science teacher gets stage 3 cancer and starts to cook meth to provide money for his family when he goes' sounds pretty stupid but once you get into the relationships between the characters and the overall development of Walter White it really is breathtaking. The amount of ditches he needs to fill just to keep his secret safe from his family and more importantly his brother in law who is a DEA.

Bryan Cranston is absolutely inspiring in this TV show and what a way to create a name for yourself by going from Malcolm in the Middle to Breaking Bad. You would truly not think that this is the same person and its one of them acting points where it was truly perfect. 

Aaron Paul plays Walter White's sidekick kinda in the meth business and his performance is also great as he applies the comedic side to everything which every show needs this in some ways. 

A show like this certainly needs the praise that all the reviewers give it and its one of the very few titles that I have given 10 because its outstanding. To anyone who has never watched it you most certainly need to get your head into gear and prepare for a ride.
