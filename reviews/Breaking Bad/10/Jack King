I have just finished watching Season 4 in what I can only describe as the best TV show I've ever watched. I believe Season 5 begins in a few weeks time and my excitement for that is through the roof! If it manages to continue with the same, mind-blowingly powerful standards in Seasons 1,2,3,4 and 5 then I don't see what's stopping Breaking Bad from becoming one of THE BEST television programmes EVER. I like everything about BB; the characters are masterfully sculpted and you can sympathise and empathise with the majority, the plot and story line of each episode is the finest I have ever witnessed and the way that the programme starts and finishes fills you with intrigue and anticipation for the forthcoming episode or next episode since most end on a cliff- hanger and begin with a weird pink bear which builds up your interest and is most puzzling until you find out about it later on. Overall, I feel words can not describe Breaking Bad's brilliance fully. NO SHOW COMPARES TO THIS.
