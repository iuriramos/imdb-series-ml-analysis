This is my 1st review & I'll keep it short. I don't remember ever watching a series as good as this & the fact that the quality was kept up throughout the whole run was (to me), amazing. I love/d this show & doubt it will be bettered. I'm looking forward to the "Better call Saul" spin-off but i don't expect it to compare. It was a rare show, in the fact that the producers stopped when they did & didn't try to take it past it's best in an attempt to make more cash. The Spin-off looks as though it may be trying to do just that though, only time will tell. Finally, on the off-chance that there is anyone out there that needs any more of a hint that this show wouldn't be a waste of their time &/or cash (re; DVD). I would recommend this to anyone except for young kids, due to the drug theme throughout.
