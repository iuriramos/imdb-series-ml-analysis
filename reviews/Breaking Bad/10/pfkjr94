This show makes you feel something that most shows or even movies for that matter. Vince Gilligan is genius to this great show. Everyone is rooting for the bad guy because he take so much crap for so long and finally he has something that matters to him. The happiest time in his life was last couple of years of his life when he cooking that blue crystal. He able to get all the revenge back from people that screwed him over in his past. The love for family and what your willing to go through to protect them. He to lie cheat and steal from people you love to protect them from the truth. Then having your son tell you he hates you for what you did. I challenge anyone to make a better show then this.Cannot wait for 2014 BETTER CALL SAUL.
