...and for good reason! I am now done with the first season on DVD. If I had to describe this series in a single sentence, It would be: Abbott and Costello spend a "Weekend at Bernie's" in "Fargo". Without Walter's lung cancer and the gruesome crime aspects of the show, it would be totally worth watching as a situation comedy. Let's recap the main family characters: Walter could not be anymore square as the high school chem teacher until he learns of the cancer. Wife Skylar is a continually bewildered bystander...and pregnant. Teenage son Walt Jr. is handicapped (CP?) but for the most part he gets it. Sis-in-law Marie is a kleptomaniac married to Hank, who is some kinda DEA cop. So the prideful Walter must figure out how to pay for his cancer treatment. He is exposed to the idea of big bucks in cooking crystal meth through Hank's drug busts, and hooks up with Jesse, a loser, stoner, small time meth dealer and coincidentally a (bad) former student of Walter. And of course the brilliant chemist Walter is capable of cooking up the best crystal meth to ever hit the streets of Albuquerque, NM, so his talent becomes quickly recognized and valued in the "biz". From there, murder, mayhem and drug deals gone bad ensue and the series takes on the personality of the Coen Brothers' "Fargo". OK, now strap on your seat belt because every minute will either have you aghast in disbelief or rolling on the floor laughing your ass off.
