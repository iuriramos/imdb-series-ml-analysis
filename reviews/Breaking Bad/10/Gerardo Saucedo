This is my first review.

I have been waiting for something as big as Breaking Bad was to write it. This show is the best I have seen (and I will see). The way Vince Gilligan plays with us, making us create theories about how next episode will be shows that it really get yo hooked. Almost every episode leaves you wanting more. I love how this series use psychology and chemistry in a very amusing way, making you sometimes feel awkward or bad for the characters, that, by the way, are perfect disenvolved.

Today this series ended with Felina, the most accurate ending I have seen, It leaves you satisfied in a way you won't believe.

So, I just have one thing to say after all 62 episodes: WATCH THIS SH*T.

Bucket list essential 10/10
