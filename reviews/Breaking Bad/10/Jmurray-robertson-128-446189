Breaking Bad is My favourite show. its writing, acting and storyline is sound. This programme has little faults and is Bryan Cranston's best work. For those of you who have not watched breaking bad, I highly recommend it. If you have watched the show however you will agree with me by saying that its a masterpiece. Breaking Bad's uses of clever real life comedy, and great action scenes are brilliant. Breaking bad is about a overqualified chemistry teacher, Walter White, who at the age of 50 gets lung cancer. To provide for his family after he dies. He decides to start cooking pure crystal Meth with his ex chemistry student, Jessie Pinkman, who used cook Meth. This story line builds up as the two men go through a lot together, it then ends very sadly, but powerfully. I highly recommend this show.
