'Breaking Bad' is very easy to like: the plot is ridiculously intriguing, the writing is top notch, the characters are extremely good and the performances of the leading cast is excellent across the board. Each season ends in spectacular fashion, leaving you wanting to jump into the next season immediately.

Having watched the series 5 times, I can safely say that this is my personal favorite TV show of all time. It (along with 'The Wire' and 'Sopranos') has revolutionized the TV-format forever - show-makers now have got something to look at and realize what could potentially be achieved with a TV show.

If you haven't watched it already - I highly recommend that you do, as soon as possible! Otherwise you are denying yourself the chance of witnessing pure greatness!
