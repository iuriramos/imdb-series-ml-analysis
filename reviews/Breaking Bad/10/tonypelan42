This is the best show that's ever been on TV and I have only just started series 5, the casting is perfect, the characters unforgettable and the story completely unpredictable, I cant recommend Breaking Bad enough and the people I have told about it have all loved it! The character progression is just fantastic as you see it unfold, I just don't know what will fill its place when I finish season 5. Walter White is the man, Jesse amazing, Gus is terrifying, Mike also, Hank is great as the DEA man and the numerous bad guys that we come across just make this show the most watchable, nerve wracking, tense and basically fantastic watch of all time. Watch it!
