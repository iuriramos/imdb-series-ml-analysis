breaking bad was the best series, i mean i have never seen something like that how one man could change his mind just for let his family comfortable in a economic way. he always was closer to be trapped but the lucky was by he side.

In general terms, the history was very understandable, i believe everything, the actors and the actresses acting very well. when i refer to the places and the crew they are very organized.

at last, i like everything about braking bad so i invited you to enjoy this series i swear it wont let you disappointed.
