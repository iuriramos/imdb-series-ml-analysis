Easily one of the best written shows in television history to date. I was engrossed in it from the start, through every single episode and it never lapsed in the drama or cheated its characters or the story. Stunning and gritty and wholly excellent. The devil is in the details, nothing wasted, everything meaningful down to the camera angles and foreshadowing.

This show was so tight from music to the costumes... and the acting, OH THE ACTING!!! I wasn't sure they could bring it to the end without dropping the ball, but they did it, keeping everyone guessing and never disappointing. I can't find fault with it. Incredibly epic series; the writers are to be congratulated and celebrated for this masterpiece.

Just watch the first episode, and if you like it at all, settle in for the ride and hang on. That is all. They've set the bar for drama unbelievably high with this one. Amazing.
