Some of the idiots who are rating Breaking Bad poorly and knocking it for stereotyping and poorly developed characters are just that..idiots. It is TV!!!! Of course most of it would probably NOT happen as it does on the show but when you are condensing LIFE into a 1 hour segment for television, it often WILL seem stereotypical! Yes, the lead character and his partner escape death too many times to believe and yes, some of the BAD guys seem to far-fetched(the 2 Mexican Hit-man) to believe but the show WORKS on so many levels if you approach it with a open mind and are WILLING to suspend some truths. I love the show and think that other than a couple of "writer's liberties" the show is dead on and very very entertaining! If you need absolute truth(all you who knock the show) go read some Dali lama books!!
