Breaking Bad documents the transition of a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher into a ruthless and powerful drug kingpin. The show itself includes enough suspense/mystery to keep you wondering, without going overboard (e.g. unlike pretty much anything by JJ Abrams). The characters are well-written and the actors all portray them masterfully. The story itself is intricate enough to make you think, without being too cerebral/confusing.

Over all, it's dark, funny, sad, and compelling...sometimes all at the same time. If you enjoy something a bit grittier, that actually has some substance to it, then you'll enjoy Breaking Bad.
