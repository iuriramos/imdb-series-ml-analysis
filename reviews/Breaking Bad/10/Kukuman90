This is my first review, however I thought I had to mention what a great show this really is! The first season is great, the second, in my opinion, is probably even better, and the third season is a little slower but some of the episodes are especially well written and acted. The way the characters develop throughout the show is nothing short of a masterpiece. The acting is top drawer. I never really rated Bryan Cranston before I saw him in this show. However I obviously overlooked what an amazing actor he really is. Aaron Paul as well plays the role brilliantly and provides a stunningly powerful performance, especially in season 2. To anyone reading this who is hoping to stumble across a GREAT show and hasn't decided whether they should give this show a go, all I have to say is please do, you will not regret it. Unfortunately this show has been slow to come onto UK TV, but this is probably THE best American TV show I have watched. Its better than any film because the characters are truly given time needed to develop.
