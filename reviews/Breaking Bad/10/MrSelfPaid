I had to write a review, I simply had to do it. I never understood what all the fuss was about when people said the show was one of the best ever until I watched it a few weeks ago. I watched the whole five seasons in just a few days and words cant express the way the show made me feel about how shows should be made. I could just imagine the love viewers must have over the years for the characters. You just can't forget the characters unlike other mediocre shows.

The acing is top notch, the directing is pretty flawless, the writing is genius, the editing is so tight that if you skip five seconds you might miss a major twist. 

To see Walter White grow from an ordinary teacher to a criminal drug lord is worth every bit of your precious time. The themes of Family, Loyalty, Greed are explored and displayed on screen with such precise accuracy. 

If I have to recommend a show to a person on his or her deathbed, this is it. In the words of Jesse Pinkman: What you waiting for... Bitch.
