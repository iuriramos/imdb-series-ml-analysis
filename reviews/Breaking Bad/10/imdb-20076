Seasons 1 and 2 have recently been shown on UK digital TV on the "Five USA" channel. They've packed the whole lot into about ten weeks, and I have been gripped since the first seconds.

I've never seen anything like this, and I've never seen any series cram so much "story" into each episode. The characters, for the most part, are completely believable - you've met them all yourselves. Their actions are completely consistent with their characters. If you can accept Walter's initial decision to build up a cash nest-egg for the family he is expecting to leave destitute, then everything that happens seems to follow inevitably. There's no way back, you're at the bottom of a hole you've dug for yourself, and all the alternatives to "keep digging" will have even more horrendous consequences.

I didn't think I'd see anything better than "The Wire", but if this one can maintain it's standard through season 3 and onwards, it may well run it close. "Breaking Bad" is up there with "The Sopranos" and "Dexter" as outstanding entertainment. This is very black humour, interlaced with the tragedy of both strong and ineffective personalities being forced to take actions they know are wrong and really don't want to do. Every decision, however logical it may seem, leads to a situation where yet another unpalatable decision has to be made.

It's a bit like real life.
