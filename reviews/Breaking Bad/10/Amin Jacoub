In the middle of fourth season I have a need to say something about Breaking Bad. I always had my favorite TV shows and I have them today, like it is Dexter or Game of Thrones, but Breaking Bad goes on the top of everything I watched and that I am watching. I must give great regards to all of the crew of the show, as any aspect here is first class. It is rare feeling for one TV show to be that good.

It is hard to be objective here, but what everyone agrees is that acting, cinematography and music is on higher standards of regular TV work. During first season I found its plot not just original but so involving and with other seasons it just become an addiction for more.

This fourth season is magnificent in its way and when I search for awards and opinions there is nothing but thrills.

And I agree. Even villains here are not just likable, and officials (DEA) are perceived as opposite to that.

The crystal met is a very bad drug, and we all know that, but here we don't think about it that way, actually the Art of the creators of the show made lead us to feel positive for our heroes. I don't know much about drugs, I only know how met is bad, but here you have feeling that met they produce might not be so harmful? Never mind it is only show.

I think that there are many moral issues here, and how they vague family life with criminal activity is masterfully. The whole positive thinking about it (Mr. White character) is that he did that because of caring of his family, as he is not negative person. And character Jesse is simply adorable, even in the criminal context, yet rightful and with high moral in itself.

I am happy that there will be one season more. This show simply deserves to be put in the film library as a rare masterfully achievement for TV with cult status like it is memorable Sopranos, Star Trek NG, Mission Impossible, Seinfeld, Twilight Zone and Tales from the Crypt to mention some of the best ever.
