Breaking Bad is indeed an excellent show from start to finish with its dark story line, intense violence, and heart-stopping moments that will surely leave you on the edge of your seat. God, I'm going to miss this show. The characters that evolve with viewings, the dilemmas that the characters must go through, and the emotionally devastating moments that have you on the verge of tears. But, of course, all bad things must come to an end. Over the days of streaming on Netflix, I journeyed from episode to episode with my eyes glued to the screen and I can definitely say that Breaking Bad is the best television show I have ever had the pleasure to see.
