The third season has came to end, and all I can say, this is the best I saw so far! The only show I watched beside Breaking Bad and had such a crushing storyline was Lost - but they messed it up ... Anyway, I can hardly wait the 4th season to start, till now it has wonderful characteristics with magnificent acting, great storyline, outstanding photography and a good direction. Recommended to everybody, who'd like to watch an exciting, animated show, with lifelike and rough-and-ready situations and turns.

The only reason I give a 9 out of 10, because this is not yet completed, not yet a finished story, but as the time passes, it gets closer and closer to it...

Outstanding show.

9/10.
