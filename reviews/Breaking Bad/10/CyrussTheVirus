Breaking Bad is quite possibly the most complete and gripping show I have ever seen in my life.

I had the opportunity to watch every episode on NetFlix and was completely blown away. The plot of the show centres around Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who discovers he has cancer and the cost of the treatment, which may not necessarily work would leave his family in huge debt.

He teams up with an old student of his, Jesse Pinkman and begins to cook and deal Meth. The story moves on from there, with plenty of mishaps and adventures which I wont go into in much detail.

The way the story changes the main characters over the 5 seasons is extraordinary. Walt changes from a kind hearted, bumbling high school teacher to a cold, calculating, sinister individual. The change is remarkable and credit has to be given to the writers for the storyline.

All in all, an excellent show which justifies all the positive reviews it has received. 

Usually once I finished watching a show from start to finish I find there to be very little reason to watch it again, however I will be making a rare exception for Breaking Bad!
