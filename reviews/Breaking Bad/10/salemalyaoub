The Characters are spot on, story, actors, directing, writing, everything about this show is phenomenally perfect. It's absolutely unpredictable. you simply don't know and won't know what happens next until it actually happens thats how intense and mind-blowing this show is. Before i started watching this show i never really knew Bryan Cranston, i mean i've seen him couple of times here and there but nothing like this. Honestly calling him a Great actor is somewhat of an understatement, the guy is simply Exceptional.

From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. if you haven't watched "BREAKING BAD" I suggest you start, because not even "Game of Thrones" (which i value and Rank as 2nd in my all time favourite list) is no where near Breaking Bad.

Kudos to Mr Gilligan and everyone involved in creating this masterpiece!!
