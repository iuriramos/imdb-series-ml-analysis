I wasn't sure it was ever gonna happen (and especially not so quickly)but i think i've found a show that challenges Dexter.

Breaking Bad is pure and simply engrossing television, that actually improves as the story evolves and the seasons pile up.What really does it for me is the emotions which this show evokes in me. One minute i'm rooting for someone, the next minute i want them dead!! It feels like a sporting event at times. Never have i had this sustained response to a show.I do actually prefer watching the aforementioned Dexter, but for uniqueness this is just pure head and shoulders..Maybe tonight is the night? Maybe it would be easier if we just, cook..
