The only TV series 'Breaking Bad' can be compared with, in my opinion, is The Sopranos.

I know they have completely different story lines, but still, they're both great Dramas. Even though Breaking Bad has more action and some thrill, they are in many ways alike.

I'm not here to compare them but to talk about what makes Breaking Bad such a excellent show. To begin with, it is produced by AMC, a channel which never disappoints in the matter of quality of TV series they air. The actors and performances are very good and intense (and that's at least a plus two in a TV drama), the writing is very solid and coherent, and the direction of each episode is masterfully done.

Bryan Cranston was one of my favorite comedy TV actors of all time since Malcolm in the Middle (FOX), and it's very nice to see how he evolved in a very positive way to drama television.

These are the seasons I give it a reasonable 10/10. And I'm sure you would give it too, if you just give this excellent show a chance to prove it's worth it.
