The Sorpranos broke ground for many of these "follow on" series. The Sorpranos were East Coast gangsters Breaking Bad, Western gangsters but still both stories were captivating in there own way. I've seen every episode of both of these series and I vote Breaking Bad a winner by a nose. Perhaps its because Breaking Bad had little nudity, sex and graphic swearing. HBO did Sopranos and A&E did Breaking Bad which is likely the reason in the differences in sex, etc. HBO has also done the Game of Thrones and its very similar in sex, etc. etc. to Sopranos but still GOT is an excellent series and well worth watching. I'm only halfway through the second season of GOT but have liked it so much I've done a review of it and gave it a 9. To sum up this review Breaking Bad is a very well written, directed. acted and shot series.
