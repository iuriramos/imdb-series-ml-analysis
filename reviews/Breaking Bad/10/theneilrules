After watching the eighth episode of Season 5, I can say for certain that Breaking Bad is the best show on television till now. Being in India, you hardly get to watch these sort of TV shows amidst our traditional flagrant family dramas with absolutely nothing to offer. This is by far the most realistic show I've ever witnessed. Bryan Cranston is amazing in the character of Walter White. He continues to impress with his acting, his shady parley and his performance in the black comedy scenes.

This is the story of Mr. White, an inventive chemistry professor who endures cancer and eventually teams up with Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to launch the purest Crystal Meth in the market. His journey transforms him from a modest human being into a menacing individual who will stop at nothing to provide a better life for his family and keeping his disguise intact with his in-laws and the rest of the world as a modest and humble being who is fighting cancer. Although he succeeds with almost everyone, his wife eventually finds out and his family gets secluded from him. But he stops at nothing to fulfill his dream of building an empire of his own which leads him to accomplish even more perilous deeds. The important message that this show conveys that no matter how hard you try to suppress a rogue endeavor, the truth will ultimately reveal itself in the long run.

This is an amazing achievement in TV history. All other actors including Anna Gunn, Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito and Jonathan Banks gives stand out performances. This is not a show for everybody though. It is mature and perfected for grown-ups but it is not to be missed under any circumstances. All I can say to the producers of this show is - Thank you & Keep 'em coming.

A must see. 10/10.
