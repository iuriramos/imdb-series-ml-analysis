IMDb is a excellent page but the problem is that a lot of people who like the other highest TV dislike pretty much the series, how is possible that Breaking Bad have under 8/10 episodes?...

Fly is maybe The worst episode but this series really have a bad episode, i'm not saying that 7 is bad number for the series but how is possible that One Minute have 8,8? really....well? 9,9 is the minimum...

IMDb users have at lest watch the series, if this page keep going on like this, for me is not what i'm looking for. it's a reall shame because is a page who has everything for a good review.
