The best TV show I have seen. I'm one of the people that didn't even know about it until it had nearly ended, and I managed to watch all 5 seasons in just over a month. I had to wait a while for the last few episodes, as they hadn't been broadcast, and the wait was unbearable.

What at first seems like an odd plot, and certainly not one you could stretch over 5 seasons, instantly becomes an utterly fantastic TV show. It is brilliantly acted, particularly by the two main actors, Cranston and Paul. The story lines are so engrossing you won't be able to stop watching - your nights will just be a blur of constant episodes.

It's also one of those brilliant shows that doesn't fluctuate or get worse with the introduction of new seasons. In my opinion, the last season was the best, and the fourth the second. Fantastic characters, fantastic villains, fantastic plots. So many moments are almost too tense to watch.

I would recommend this show to anybody, I've told several of my friends to watch it and not a single one has not said they loved it.

All in all, absolutely brilliant.
