The Best TV-Series there is and the best there ever Will be. Heisenberg 4ever. Too bad you can not assign note 100, and therefore assign the maximum possible, namely, note 10. Thank entire personnel that kept me breathless throughout the period of the five seasons. Maybe it should not continue with the other 5 seasons. Or who knows? Kudos too, to creator Vince Gilligan to have the courage to end the show at just the right time rather than string it out past where the story would bear. It may take a few episodes to get into, but you owe it to yourself to try. This is powerful, important and utterly enthralling stuff. But believe in one thing: this series can make us chase dreams that we would have not invested or may just be time well spent but it makes us realize that it is not necessary to be born in a slum to be a criminal. And do not say that it is something that is born with us: We can all Break Bad .
