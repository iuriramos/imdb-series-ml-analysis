Every time I think about Breaking Bad or watch any of the last 3 episodes I feel like my hypothetical wife of ten years was R***d and K****d in front of me. im exaggerating a tad so plz don't be hateful. but my point is I get emotional and cry about every time. i had a 6 year relationship with this show. i watched the Pilot episode the day it aired and the never missed one episode NO JOKE! no show in the past or present is like they never existed so to speak. i mean they don't compare and i cant see how any shows in the future could trump the power this one had to captivate an audience. i hate to speak ill of this show but what im about to say is more of a pro than a con but the only episode that i disliked mostly was the fly episode where walt and jessi done nothing but try to catch that stupid fly. it was sort of a funny episode and a secret was almost revealed but that was it. so out of the 60+ episodes only one was kind of boring. 10/10 still. love it will always love it and plan to watch the entire series annually i done every season leading up to the next just before the new season would begin I'd watch the ones before to catch up. i done this for 5 years so needless to say i know this show very well.
