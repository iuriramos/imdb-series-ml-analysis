what makes this show popular and loved throughout is its simplicity and the absolute premise that it sets in the very first pilot itself,i.e a dying man wants to make his family financially secure even after he is dead. The character of Walter White cannot be hated,for he is sad,introvert,bully to his brother-in-law,under-employed for his qualifications and has been an under achiever all his life. This gets the viewers feel his emotions and urgency of his cause. After this premise has been set in the pilot,thus starts the joy ride of Walter White's struggle from a chemistry teacher to the most prolific Crystal meth cook and drug agent/smuggler till the end. Its the character development of Walter White over due course that accounts for the name of the show,which means over time he gets socially good-bad-worse,i.e. he can go leaps and bounds without any restrictions and hesitations to do that suits him the best. The makers have done a good job with not complicating the plot with lots of FBI agents,cars,chases,surveillance strategies,fancy dialogue and good looking tanned actors with accomplished body. Hence this made the show unique in the popular DRUGS-MAFIA genre and all the actors were brilliant for their respective characters.Also the pace of the show is just perfect for the characters in depth analysis and dilemma portrayal,which accordingly justifies the good and evil of every character in the show.
