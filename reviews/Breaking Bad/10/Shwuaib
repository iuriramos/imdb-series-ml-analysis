Breaking Bad is a perfect example that there is no need for special effects, zombies or blowing up buildings in order for a TV series to be excellent. The storyline and the combination of a variety of characters gives the series such balance and flow. The show gets better by season and eventually you are onto season 5 which is one of the most brilliant productions of all time.

The ending scene is sensational as we see how drug production really did destroy Walter White and create a new man in Heisenberg. Breaking bad truly does capture you emotionally which is something which keeps giving you the desire to watch the next episode. Overall, an incredible series.
