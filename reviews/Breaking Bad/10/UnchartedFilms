I don't even want to write a review. Breaking Bad IS the best show to ever grace TV screens, and unless Vince Gilligan outdoes himself in the future with an even better show (however hard to fathom) this IS and WILL BE the best show you'll ever see. I would now like to see Gilligan get into the movies and pull another trick out of his hat. This is the golden age of TV and Breaking Bad is its flagship, thanks to cast, cinematographers, directors, and most of all Vince Gilligan, the show's creator, and his co-writers. I hope these talents spill into cinema, grab it by the horns and give it a good shake up, because it needs people with attributes, BADLY!
