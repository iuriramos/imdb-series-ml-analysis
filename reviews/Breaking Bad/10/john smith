Breaking bad has every single thing you could want on a show. It has a great plot, unbelievable acting, a ton of action, and some of the biggest bad-asses in TV history. It all starts with the great plot. It is a cool plot where it is so fun to find out whats going to happen next. Probably one of the most addicting shows ever. You can never get bored of breaking bad. You are going to never want to leave the TV. They take an innocent protagonist and turn him into the antagonist but at the same time you love him. It is cool to learn how awesome science can be. The acting is out of this world. I never in a million years thought the goofy Bryan Cranston could take on a serious role and play it better than i could imagine. I had only seen him on Malcolm in the Middle so when I saw him in the description I thought the show would be bad but i could have never been more wrong. Cranston acts out of this world. Aaron Paul shocked me so much. He did an even better job than Cranston. He puts so much emotion into the show. He plays his part perfectly, I could not imagine anyone else playing Jesse Pinkman. The action is out of this world. There are constantly explosions, gun shots, deaths, and much more throughout the show. It really adds great suspense to the show. I think Walter "heisenberg" White (Bryan Cranston) has taken on the role of the biggest bad-ass on TV. He has so many bad ass scenes. Ranging from cool lines to big explosions. Heisenberg has the intelligence of Michael Schofield (Wentworth Miller, Prison Break), he has the craziness of Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland, 24), and the pure awesomeness of Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson, Taken). If you have not seen this show than this is the show you have to watch right now. It is the best show on Television.
