The outline is clear. Most people will know what it is about even those who haven't seen the show. The teacher who decides to take a step into darkness. And the consequences, he and others have to suffer because of that. Bryan Cranston is superb in his portrayal of Walter White the chemistry teacher, who after being diagnosed with cancer, decides to take matters in his own hands.

Having met an old pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman played by Aaron Paul, both undergo a journey, that has its up and downs. But while Walter White has his family (and all the relationships feel realistic), there is a special bond that is hard to explain, between Mr. White and Pinkman. Trying to depict every little great aspect of the show would take too long. The show itself though does take its time, building up tension and when it gets released, it is heavy! Be it because of the action involved or the emotional impact.

The first season may seem to have a very slow pace, but even so it has more than its fair share of great moments (I'll only mention the bathtub, which had me almost crying because of laughter). Season 2 picks up and there is almost no stopping after that. There are McGuffins here and there (like the eye of a teddy bear to name but one) and they all enhance the feeling that this show is real. Feels real that is. The show is obviously for mature audiences, because of its content. Which is the violence and the behavior of characters, not any nudity!
