Breaking Bad represents an absolute example of putting the best ingredients (actors, directing, script, ...) in the filming recipe, which is really what makes the difference, i.e. you cannot say which part of the series is the strongest one. Another innovative characteristic of the show is the fact that it lacks irrelevant scenes put there just to fill the episode (e.g. see Vince Masuka role in Dexter, especially season 8). Thus, the script and the plot is very solid focusing around the characters created with an amazing and extraordinary way. Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is the most evolving character in TV history, starting from the "good" side and gradually going to the "bad" one, which justifies absolutely the show's title. The last season of Breaking Bad reaches the highest peak as far as acting is concerned with powerful dialogs and could easily represent an original Greek drama. Thanks everyone in Breaking Bad for the best moment in TV history which I definitely recommend.
