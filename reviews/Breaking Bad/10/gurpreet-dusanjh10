BREAKING BAD is best serial in the television history. This show is beyond comparison. Many people's and critics compare this show with Game of Thrones but Breaking Bad is far much better. I watched Game of Thrones and yeah it's good. But not good as Breaking Bad because Breaking Bad is perfect show.

I can give this show 100 stars out of 10. Story is brilliant and well told. It's perfectly balanced. If I talk about performances then I can say every actor plays their characters beautifully. Bryan Cranston as Walter White is great. What an acting by Bryan. Aaron Paul as Jessie and Anna Gunn as Skyler is Great. Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte and Dean Norris are great supporting actors. Bod Odenkirk as Saul is a great comical character.

This show is best. For me BREAKING BAD is the best serial ever made in TV shows history.. Must Watch Show. Thanks to VINCE GILLIGAN...
