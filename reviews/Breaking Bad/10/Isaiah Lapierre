This show is perfection in every sense of the word. I went on a Netflix splurge of this show (which I believed maximized the enjoyment and addiction. Everything about this series is unbelievably good, and the hype is deserved. Like when older people rave about The Sopranos and its greatness, I am glad to have been apart of a group that enjoyed and will rave about the rise and fall of a high school chemistry teacher. The acting, writing and direction all complement a fantastic drama. It deserves more emmys if possible. Don't wait around watch this show if you are not hooked then you wont get to enjoy probably the best thing to grace television for a long time. Many have or will glop onto other great shows Homeland, Game of Thrones, Dexter, Mad Men, etc, but they all pale in comparison to this incredible success. 

Breaking Bad knew what was and never wasted time telling an unforgettable story. Really don't wait to watch this show. Like at the end of Troy when Odysseys says I lived in the time of Achilles, I lived in the time of Walter White. I am speechless...
