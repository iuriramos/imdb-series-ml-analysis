Those behind the genius crime series Breaking Bad does everything so well that I simply envy them for being a part of it, every one of them. This production simply stinks of the pleasure of doing good drama, in everything from creating, screen writing, directing, acting and everything else in a drama production. What fun they must have had! And if one can call this humor, has it ever been more black? I don't think I have seen any thing better made for television. Breaking Bad would have been a hit in cinemas. I saw Lars Von Triers five hour with one break movie The Kingdom, and it didn't seem long at all. Watching one whole season of Breaking Bad as a full day cinema session would have been nothing less than just brilliant.
