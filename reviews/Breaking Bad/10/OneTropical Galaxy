I highly recommend that you watch this show. A fantastic drama series with touches of comedy. Bryan Cranston plays Chemistry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he "never smoked." His finances are in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems. Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his brother-in-law Hank played by Dean Norris, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer. This is really Bryan Cranston at his best & has rightly deserved all awards given to him for this character. All in all - Great cast, Great acting & Story lines are captivating. A MASTERPIECE!
