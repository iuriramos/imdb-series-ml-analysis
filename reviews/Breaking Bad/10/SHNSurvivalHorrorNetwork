This Show ...... i heard about it circa 2 Months ago and everyone told me i should watch this. Well I'm so Happy that i did :D Breaking bad Is by far the best TV-Series in storytelling,Drama lets say everything. The 1st Season was a bit boring, but starting the 2nd Season it got every episode i watched better. The Story is about a family man and chemistry teacher called Walter White. One Day he finds out that he has i think Lung cancer, and that he will die and he needs a treatment. The big Problem is that Mr. White doesn't have the Money to pay for it. So he asks his former Student Jesse if he would cock meth with him. His Objective is to make money to care for his family and pay for his lung cancer treatment. As the Seasons go on Walter gets more ruthless and to a giant criminal mastermind ( he always has a plan). He goes on to build a big Drug Empire. In Season 5 we see this whole Empire breakdown as Walts brother in-law, a DEA agent called Hank finds out that he is the man who he has been searching for so long. I really fell in Love with this show and it's very hard to let it go. The good thing is i never had to wait 1 week or more to know how the Story continues. So people go and watch this series it's a piece of TV show history that will never die. you will not regret this
