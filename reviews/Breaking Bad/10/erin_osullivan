This is by far an outstanding television show. Amidst a lot of other terrible TV this show stands out. The crux of this show is Walter White is a bored family man and incredibly smart science teacher who gets diagnosed with lung cancer. To pay for his treatment and to leave enough money for his family if he dies he teams up with an ex-student to start making meth. And so begins a web of lies to Walt's family and friends.

This show plays on so many emotions of the viewer. We know that what Walt is doing is wrong yet we sympathise with him because he loves his family and would do basically anything for them.

Bryan Cranston is outstanding as Walt. The thing that I love about this show is that when one episode finishes you just HAVE to watch the next one, and they have little links at the beginning of each episode that all make sense at the end of the season. There are so many little twists thrown in, I absolutely fell head over heels for this show. The characters all have their flaws but given all the circumstances it makes you question what you would do if you were put in that situation. Amazing.
