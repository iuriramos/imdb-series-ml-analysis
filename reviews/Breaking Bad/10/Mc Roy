This show = Meth. Its not just a TV show, its an experience. Period. Thats it guys, I have no more to say, I just want to express my feeling about the show because I love it so much that I have to say it out loud. OK I run out of words. All the things I write started from here is just pure rubbish that you and I don't really care as it is meaningless. You can choose to read or not I don't really care because the objective is to achieve 10 lines of text, a guideline is a statement by which to determine a course of action which means that I have to follow it so that I do not break the rules, I hope the admin don't ban me because I lack of the trait of imaginative and English is not my primary language. Wow I already reached 10 lines, thank you. I still want to say that I love Breaking Bad. KThxBye
