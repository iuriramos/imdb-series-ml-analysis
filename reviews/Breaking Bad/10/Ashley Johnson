I started watching the series on Netflix the day before the premiere of the final season aired on AMC. It had been on my "laundry list" of shows to watch since about the middle of it's second season but I had never gotten around to watching it because I was just prepared that it wouldn't completely blow me away. So instead I watched Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock, It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, The Office and many, many other TV shows. 

To my disappointment, I should have tuned in when the very first episode was aired. 

Breaking Bad has taken the entire genre of TV dramas and TV shows in general to a new height of not only shock value but excellent writing and casting. Nearly each episode you're sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. Instead of one upping the previous episode by it's dramatic scenes or crazy ways of the illegal drug production, sale and so on, the writers make the absolute unexpected happen. It may seem like a lot of people say things such as, "It's so crazy, you won't even see it coming." in instances that it may be unexpected, but that is where Breaking Bad changed everything. It is impossible to tell what will happen next because that's just how well it is written and thought of. Down to each and every last detail is pressed out and made sure to be perfect before filming for the episode I'm sure even begun. 

Don't pass up Heisenberg.
