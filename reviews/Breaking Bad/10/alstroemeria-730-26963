I have to share with you that this series is one of the most refreshingly unique and innovative ideas I have ever seen expressed in a TV drama. Walt, who is a chemistry teacher has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He has to make sure he provides for his family including his pregnant wife Skyler and his son who has a disability. He decides to start making crystal meth with his accomplice, a former student called Jesse. The comedy is so dark, with each episode as Walt and Jess venture further and further into the scary world of illegal drugs the audience is left thinking, 'oh please don't do that - please don't do that!' and then they do. The series is not for the squeamish however, I agree with many others, it's just about the best thing that's been on TV, I am a huge fan and have just purchased series 2.
