Breaking Bad can tear you apart with a gunshot, and also with a phone call. It can air an episode full of one jaw-dropping action scene after another... and then it can turn around and make you gasp through the sheer quietness of a remote cabin. This series has been a character study in one individual, famously going from Mr. Chips to Scarface, but having seen Walt at both those extremes. You Have to see this series before you die. if you wonder humph what after Breaking Bad well i suggest Oz,The Wire,Got,and Suits. but non of those series can get a "Heisenberg" level I apology my bad speech but hey i dnt give a sht Have A1 day.
