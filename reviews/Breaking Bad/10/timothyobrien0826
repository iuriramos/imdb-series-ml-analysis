I would like to start off by saying, I never review a single thing. This show was so worthy of it I cannot believe it's over. Lucky it wasn't strung on though. From watching other AMC originals I knew this was going to be great from the start. At first the story is slow but once it takes off it takes off. Bryan makes a phenomenal actor when it comes to this show but I personally loved watching Jesse, played by Aaron Paul, a former student of Walters and junkie who hooks you without knowing it. The twists and turns in this show is what makes it absolutely astounding. This is a MUST watch that should be on everyone's bucket list.

The plot is amazing; a man not being able to pay his bills, later on finding out he has lung cancer and decides the reasonable thing to do is stock pile for his family after he is gone. For the plot alone I give it 5 star rating but during the plot Walter changes his way of doing things and becomes, a monster so to speak, which bumps it up to a 7 star review. The action and the quick on the feet decision making, tied in with great music, back stories, well played cast members, and every little detail being stitched together at least by the very end is what won my 10 star review and what won them all the awards. 

If you want a show that will make you fiend for more, this IS the show. Grab you a chair and enjoy. I promise you though once it's over it's over. I myself don't want to believe it is but...Yeah
