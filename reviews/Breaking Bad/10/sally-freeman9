We watched the entire 5 seasons over about 2 months.

I enjoyed it immensely. 

Some parts are hard to watch - it's not for everyone, but it's funny, sad, disturbing, believable and really original.

The acting is incredible and Bryan Cranston thoroughly deserves every award he has won for Breaking Bad.

I've never watched a series where I've changed my feelings so much against main characters before, the character development is brilliant.

I don't think they'll ever make a series as good as this! I strongly recommend you give it a go!
