I really do not know what to talk about this series , I can only say that without a doubt is the best drama ever made in world television history , first place in the TOP 10 of IMDb, actors handpicked to bring an excellent job in which each actor fits perfectly into its proper character. Writers , producers , actors , directors , finally , the whole cast this great series is of congratulations, six years of work they earned several Emmys including best actors and best series dramatic . accompany Breaking Bad from the second episode of the third season and I have never been disappointed with this series. No doubt she deserves all notes 9.0 upwards you received , this was the only series that really thrilled me , thrill me , cheer , get angry by characters . Whether you are in doubt whether to attend or not , I do not know to say , is a series brilliant certainly but to us who look forward year by year , it was more exciting to stay in that anguish of "Well , now only next year ." Guess I'm rolling , but this is it.10/10 is my note .

As said AMC : " Thanks for making bad so good"
