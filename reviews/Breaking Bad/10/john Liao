I like the main character Mr White a lot. This TV shows show how a good heart man gradually change himself to a bad guy. Sometimes, you have to do some bad things because you don't have a choice. A funny is that they really did a website which is used to gather the donation for Mr White. But actually, I think Mr White is a big bad guy who let so many people die and finally, he got his bad outcome. Besides, Gustavo Fring who sell the fired chicken. He is the real hero. He revenge after he got power. He defeat the enemy by his own! Comparing to Gustavo, Mr White is just a vile character. And his wife is really bad wife who makes me angry for many times. In summary, this is a really good TV shows, it is worthwhile to watch it. You can talk to people when you have meals with them.
