A story about a chemistry teacher who learns that he has lung cancer and to support his family starts preparing the drug meth from which he hopes to earn enough money.

Breaking Bad has everything going for it whether its the direction or the acting or writing.This is one of the few shows which provides such a detailed character arc of all the leads. What this show does well is blend dark humor with suspense with (occasional)action with detailed character sketches.This show is all about the details, its amazing how well the script is thought out(many scenes resort to metaphors).The moral dilemmas which each character faces in many situations throughout the 4 seasons are quite intense.Many complain that this show is slow but its this slow pace which helps to build the tension.If we didn't care about the characters then why would we care about what happens next in their life and in order for us to care about the characters we need to understand them and their mindset and that is only possible if the show has a slow pace in which each actor has time to showcase their character. In season 1 walter white is this reserved chemistry teacher who loves his family and seems like a person who wont even hurt a fly but as the seasons progress he truly breaks bad and his evil side is let loose. The marvelous thing about the show is that the supporting cast is brilliant, they are not just random people who are penned down on the script just to accompany walter white in his story but they are well thought out characters who affect the whole story.

The acting in this show is the best you will ever see. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are currently my 2 most favorite people in this world.They live the characters and give their characters life.Their are many tense moments in this show where the characters are in a difficult situations and they have to get out of them and these situations are really thrilling ,but what i find more thrilling is when the character has 2 choices to make and in most cases one choice is good and one choice is evil and the way the whole scenario and the moral dilemma is showcased really makes you just want to stand up and clap.

I truly recommend this show cause this show will absorb you into its METH world. This show might just be the best show you haven't seen!!!!!
