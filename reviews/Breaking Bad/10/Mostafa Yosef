This is my first review about any thing and i couldn't be more grateful that it's about breaking bad . it's without a doubt the best thing that ever happened on TV . the leading actor Bryan Cranston is in my own opinion one of the best actors in Hollywood right now .this guy will make you experience a roller coaster of emotions through the whole show .the entire cast is just amazing and each of the characters are perfectly developed and written .the thing about TV shows that i don't like is that sometimes they sort of lose track at the end it's like their curve is going up and down through the seasons well i can assure you that you will not see this on breaking bad ,this show will just keep rising and rising till the last second of it .breaking bad is a must see phenomena . from the first season it's an addiction and you can't stop watching it . don't hesitate for a second to start it right now .
