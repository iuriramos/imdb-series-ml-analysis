I have no words for this show. It is without question the best show on earth. People think the walking dead is better but trust me its not. This show is rated the highest show on IMDb. The acting is awesome. And they never stop running out of ideas. In every episode there is a twist. I especially liked the pilot episode and every one of the season finales. If you don't watch breaking bad you do not have a life and you should start because it will become your favorite show. GUARANTEED. My favorite person in breaking bad is Jesse pinkman. He always makes me laugh with his personality and twists. My favorite episode was when they killed hank and Skyler holds a knife on Walter. Then Walter junior attacks his dad to save his mom. That was the biggest twist in the show. I loved that episode but I was very sad because hank died. You have to start watching this NOW
