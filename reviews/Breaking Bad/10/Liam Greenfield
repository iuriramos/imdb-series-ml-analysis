I will always love film but every once in a while a TV show will come along and blow any one time 2 hour experience out of the water. I had it with The Sopranos, then The Wire, and now with Breaking Bad. This is TV with quality as high as some of the best films made. The format allows time to really develop characters and get you involved with the complicated plot threads. No show would be any good without quality acting (this is a major issue I had with programmes like Lost), and the acting here is excellent. The casting director for this series deserves awards. All the emotions that the actors portray within their roles are completely believable, and engrossing. The writing is concise and intelligent; not afraid to be slow with its pace but always driving forwards, whilst still providing moments of exhilaration. The direction is smooth, concentrating on excellent cinematography to really get the look of a good quality film - and consistent throughout. What makes this series stand out most for me is that each season is different. It is not about recreating what has already been seen previous but concentrates more on changing situations and character relationships quite dramatically - and this is how it improves, with the fourth season being amongst the best Television seasons I have ever witnessed. I long for more series of this calibre. BREAKING BAD 10/10.
