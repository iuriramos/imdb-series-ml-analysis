A TV Series, Breaking Bad won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series, the Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series, and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. 

I was getting interested in the show when many sources and critics telling me that it was one of the greatest series of all time. So I started to watch Breaking Bad. The show started slightly slow, but I was certainly hooked by all the characters. All the actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting their own characteristic into every nuance. By season 3, I was addicted to the storyline and cannot stop watching it.

Breaking Bad is about a high school chemistry teacher, Walter White who suddenly finds he is dying for cancer. To leave anything to his family, he teams up with a former student Jesse Pinkman to make and sell methamphetamine. They're so good at it that they become major criminals. 

Breaking Bad has brilliant acting, story and direction. It has intrigue, danger and moments of comedy. Every objects, characters and events during 5 seasons are all connected. The intelligence and clue are on dialogue and plot lines. Therefore, you cannot miss a single scene. You can become Sherlock Holmes by watching this series. I really enjoy guessing what Walter and other character's next step will be.

I also love its outstanding camera picture and music editing. It creates a lot of unforgettable moments by using complex angle to shoot. Besides, it displays a lot of symbolic items and colors to show the roles' mentation. Breaking Bad develops its own black humor style. It always uses relaxing music to mix with violent scenes. You will be just astonished by the contradiction of setting.

In my opinion, Breaking Bad is the best television show ever. It has a fantastic ending. It is an unmissable and superb crime drama.
