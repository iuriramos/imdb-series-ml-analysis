The last season had just a teeny bit of drag for me, but I got over it. The new season starts next week and I cannot wait! It is the best show on TV for so many reasons. The writing is pure genius and the acting is perfection right down to the smallest roles. Anyone who has not watched this series from the very first episode cannot understand the hoopla. I've tried to explain it to friends and family, but no one understands until they watch that first season and get hooked. Breaking Bad is, like its own reason for existence, a drug. Oh, tried to post and I didn't write the minimum of ten. So...Way down upon the Swanee River, far, far away...now I have. LOL!
