This show is amazing. Honestly, anyone who is willing to invest this much time into a TV show should invest it in this show. It won't always be nice to the viewer, it won't let you breathe somehow, it will keep you waiting, it will break your heart and it will make viewers reflect on our long history of watching movies passively and criticize our neutrality. Breaking Bad is accessible to the average viewer but rewards the active watcher. The story is a Greek tragedy dressed with a modern coating, creating and slowly dehumanizing the "protagonist" Walter White into someone the viewer usually despises. This show is all about change and brings the audience for the ride where we visually and emotionally witness the change of Heisenberg. The cinematography is breathtaking and personal, the performances are jaw dropping and sincere and the story is a down to earth modern tragedy. Just watch it, do yourself a favor.
