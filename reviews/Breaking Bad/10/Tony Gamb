I have seen all the episodes to this series except the finale which is coming out next week and i can't wait to see what will finally happen. How will this all end? This show is pure genius and the writing is magnificent i think it is safe to say that Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show of all time PERIOD. I have seen legendary shows like The Wire and The Sopranos but none can be compared to Breaking Bad, the acting is top notch. So for the people that have not seen the show and for the future generation that are going to go to IMDb to read the reviews before seeing it i have only one thing to say: Do you want a Epic series this is it. Pure quality from season 1-5.
