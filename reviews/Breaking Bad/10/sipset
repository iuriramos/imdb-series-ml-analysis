I have been hooked on this show ever since my friend recommended it to me. I can watch any episode and not be disappointed.

I have never been connected to a show in the way I have with Breaking Bad. I truly am upset that it is all over. I'm also so glad that Vince Gilligan cleared up all loose ends in the final episode instead of leaving us hanging.

I can't complain about any of the actors/actress' they were phenomenal. Gustavo Frings character is so bad ass yet so gentle and well spoken.

I will probably be back millions of times editing this review just to spew on how amazing this show truly is.
