Breaking Bad is not only one of my personal favorites, but also regarded as one of the greatest TV show of all time by many critics and reviews.

After numerous nominations, in 2014 the show won the well deserved Golden Globe Award for Best Dramatic Series and for Best Dramatic Actor. Beside this, Breaking Bad won 16 Primetime Emmy Awards in total. Not to mention, that the show is rated 9,5/10 on IMDb, based on almost 900000 votes.

The protagonist of this five season drama is Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), an overqualified chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with cancer. He probably has about a month left, so he decides to make money for his family in his last days. He comes across his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), and together they start a new business. They start cooking the best speed in town to sell it to the cartel.

The show is simply great. The cinematography, the screenplay, the soundtrack and the directing are amazing and revolutionary, but the most memorable is undoubtedly the acting. Not only the leading actors and actresses, but also the supporting and minor characters have made unforgettable performances. But of course, Bryan Cranston stands on the top, with his brilliant portrayal of 'the cook'. He makes his character arc perfectly, performs his way from a weak chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug lord, from Walter White to Heisenberg. He easily is the best anti-hero ever to be written or performed. Not a wonder, that Cranston won the Golden Globe for this role, although Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn would've deserved it as well.

Beside these, Breaking Bad became iconic thanks to its memorable lines (Say my name!, I'm the one who knocks!, I'm the danger) and to the dramatic episodes such as Felina, Granite State, Face-Off and Ozymandias.

Watching this show is obligatory. One of the few unique masterpieces of its generation.

My Rating: 10/10
