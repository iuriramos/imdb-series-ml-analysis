There are no superlatives left in the English language that have not been showered on this series, it has won almost every award it possibly can and deservedly so.

Bored of the usual drab I started watching Breaking Bad almost from the beginning after reading a favourable review of the pilot. A few episodes later I was telling people this was the best drama I have ever seen. Don't you mean of late I kept getting asked. Erm no, THE BEST EVER!! Ah come on, ER, Sopranos, The Wire etc etc.

2 Years later everybody was on the same page.

With the series drawing to a close I watched the whole series again from the beginning. The astonishing thing is that not only is it as good as I remembered but each and every episode is a classic. Believe me, you cannot sit down and say this is the stand-out episode of the show. At least a dozen of them would get onto any list of the best episode ever.

If you have never watched it, you're an idiot and put it on your bucket list. If you have, watch it again, second time around it's even better because you know what this innocent, mild-mannered teacher is about to become a few seasons down the line!!!
