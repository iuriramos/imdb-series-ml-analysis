I'm not lying. This is the greatest show ever created by man. It ended perfectly and did not drag on. The acting is amazing and the characters they play are even better. If you haven't seen this show, just stop. Go to Netflix, your DVR, etc. and just watch it. It will take about a month if you watch about two episodes a night, but it's worth it. Everything about it is just so... awesome. I know you are probably thinking, "Oh everybody has told me about this show, how good can it really be?" It's not going to change your life or anything, so just have no expectations and come in only reading the plot summary. Make sure you watch it, without the feeling that you are being forced to. Do it on your own time without anybody in your ear who has already seen it. It's made to entertain you.
