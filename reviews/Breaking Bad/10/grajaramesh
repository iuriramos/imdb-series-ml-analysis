If there is one show which has absolutely no flaws throughout the series, it has to be Breaking Bad. The show just kept on improving from earlier seasons. 2nd was better than 1st, 3rd than 2nd, 4th than 3rd and 5th was the ultimatum. Nevertheless, all the seasons were just mind blowing. I loved the transformation of Walter White in to Heisenberg. The same guy who thought $737,000 was what enough to support his family after he is gone, even millions couldn't cater his thirst. The scene in which he says "Just, say my Name" in S5 just gave me goose bumps even for a second viewing. Each and every character in the series was there for a reason and each of them had their presence felt. That's what is magnificent about the series. Casting is brilliant and acting is top notch. I don't think there is any other actor who could portray Walter White as Bryan Cranston did. Hands down!! 

I strongly recommend it.
