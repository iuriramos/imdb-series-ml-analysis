I must start by saying that Breaking Bad is the best show on TV i ever watched.

I heard about this since it started it's 2nd season, everywhere wonderful review, really good critics, and high IMDb rating, but i just let it slip since i didn't think this is that good.

But a few weeks back when i heard that Breaking Bad ended it was every where and that is when i decided to give it a go, so i bought it and it blew (especially after i watched the first season).

Today i completed watching it and I'm really happy that i did and sad that it drew me inside and like every time you watch something you think what next, what now after this.

Now, i think AMC is the network for mind blowing shows Madmen, Low Winter Sun, The Walking Dead... and the greatest of all Breaking Bad.

This show has everything packed in, everything you look for in a good show, Very good cast (characters), writing, directing, story, layer upon layer carefully placed, nicely developed... just great.

Keep up the good work and bring us the good shows AMC.
