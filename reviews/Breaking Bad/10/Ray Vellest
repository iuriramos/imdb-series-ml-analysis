As Breaking Bad reaches it's conclusion, it leaves behind a vacuum which will be near impossible to be filled, and while this surely sound extremely cheesy, it's the absolute truth. Breaking Bad was the first and the only TV Show ever to capture my attention to the fullest, the only show to ever land me at the edge of my seat in every episode, the only show that made me actually question, what the heck is coming next? Breaking Bad was an island of originality in the midst of a sea of clich√©s and terribly written series. For what is worth, what this TV show did, was never done before, to show the human nature as it really is, a constant struggle in between right and wrong, there are hundreds of Walter White out there, in the real world, people that when pushed to their limits are going to push the boundaries a little bit further, and then again, to source their needs, and many will change in the process, just as like Walter showed us. The ultimate legacy of Breaking Bad is to have thrown in our faces the dark side of human existence.
