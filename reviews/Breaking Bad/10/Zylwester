This show is the greatest show I have ever seen. I'm not much of a TV- series fan but this one's mind-blowing. The plot is great. You'll never know what happens next. Acting is superb. There's isn't even one person in this series with poor acting. 

The thrill is always nearby. I couldn't stop watching this TV-series. It was the most addictive thing I've ever seen on television.

Recommend this to EVERYONE!!!

This pitch-black comedy drama series is fantastic. The relations between the different characters are stunning. The creators of Breaking Bad have done a extraordinary job creating something that reaches all the way to the audience.
