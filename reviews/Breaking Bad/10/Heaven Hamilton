I loved all 62 episodes of the show. The script is so well written. The actor bring such amazing emotion to the critical scenes. I love watching walter transform. Breaking bad is brilliant. Favorite episode: SEASON 5, episode 14. The episode shows just how far we have came since season one. How hank has to suffer because of walt. How walt looses everything ! His family. His money. He screws Jesse over. The episode is emotional and thrilling. I am so thankful for Vince Gilligan. Breaking bad is my #1 show. The best show you will ever watch. Slow burning genius! Only other show to have strong plot and impact is my second favorite show Prison Break. The thing we I found most relevant to breaking bad was character development. EVERY character development. It was great. Walt is the Anti -Hero that we love, we root him on, and yet he makes us regret it by showing his bad side. BRYAN Cranston. My new favorite actor. The whole cast is just great.I am excited for better call saul. Sad breaking bad is over. Thrilled in knowing it television history!
