Without a doubt, Breaking Bad is the best show ever created. Right from the pilot episode, this show had me engaged from start to finish. Every episode had meaning, emotion and humor, and there was not one episode that I felt was bad.

What makes breaking bad is the characters and the originality of the plot. The acting is magnificent. Even from the most minor character you can think of. The plot is outstanding and without the style, color and writing from the brilliant mind Vince Gilligan, the plot would not have worked. Vince was made to make this movie as the entire cast and crew were. The style of the show is so unique. Almost like a Tarantino film. The characters and writing are definitely something like a Tarantino film.

Season 1 starts off nice and easy with some slow paced moments, setting up the characters and plots in a smooth and timely manner. Season 2 kicks off straight away with suspense and curiosity. Season 3 is more family and drama based but is used so that the audience can connect to the characters even more and can feel for them. Season 4 is amazing. Every episode had its 'HOLY SH*T' moments. And lastly, season 5 is a masterpiece. The ending was extremely satisfying and left an imprint in your mind for days, weeks and months. 

For the people missing out on Breaking Bad. You are missing out on a revolutionary show. From start to finish, this show will get you thinking, will make you sad, laugh and leave you to think that you were in an experience like no other. The Walking Dead is nothing compared to this masterpiece.
