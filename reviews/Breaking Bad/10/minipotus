Among the series I've watched so far, some faded away after a couple of seasons, became diluted and mainstream. But I say this one is unique in terms of story development. I feel it gets more and more exciting season after season. The dialog was short to the point that the story wants to convey without deliberation and with some everyday familiar context. Abundant use of specific techniques ranging from zooming scenes on small little things to fast forward scenes, also kind of serve as a theme of Breaking Bad. The best part of it is excellent character depiction. Every actor and actress was really good at the respective role and not just them, the screenplay writers make the scenes longer. I normally agree with filmmakers when they don't want to show excessive seconds every scene as it could derail the story. The downside is the audience is unrealistically crammed what the makers want to show with just dialogs. But in Breaking Bad, the scene may not cut after a character finished conversation and slammed the door but followed him a bit longer when he expressed his state of mind. So all in all, I recommend Breaking Bad 10/10.
