Breaking Bad - Walter White's decent from kind, committed and professional teacher of Chemistry to single-minded sociopath.

An absolutely excellent and peerless series that has captivated me from the very start of season 1.

The scripts are well-paced and even if you think that it could all move along a little more quickly you later understand the need to set context. This is not "bubblegum" television and needs investment by the viewer to get the very most out of the plot, and the characters excellent dialogue.

Recommended to all. Television at it's very, very best.
