"Nothing stops this train!".. you realize early on how accurate those words are, and the intensity only ramps-up as the episodes go by... unavoidably and ultimately heading towards a very dark place (and you start to make an educated guess how it is all going to end). It's a highly acclaimed, award winning show... with production values that are very high, and acting across the board that is outstanding. Bryan Cranston and Anna Gunn are pure gold.. his transformation to an uncontrollable monster, and her attempts at having to deal with all goes with it, is unquestionably remarkable work. There's really only a couple main characters in the entire show that are at all likable, the rest are drug-dealing criminals and low-life's, or damaged personalities. It was most disappointing to see the alluring Krysten Ritter.. bit.ly/15r7d1Z .. depart after so few episodes.. most fans would have truly liked to see her continue for another season or two. It was a loss for the show, having such a dynamic female character excised so quickly. Once she left, the only reason to stick with the series is to see how all plays out between Skyler and Walt. What is most at issue is the writing. The story just has numerous obvious and unbelievable elements that cannot be overlooked, although it appears most viewers are unabashedly willing to do so. It's not enough of a reason not to watch (although the recurring violence could really be a deal breaker for many). A solid 5-stars, not to say, it could have been better with just some minor script alterations.
