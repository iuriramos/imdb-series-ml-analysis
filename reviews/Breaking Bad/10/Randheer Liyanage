Well this is my first review on IMDb and I thought of doing this for the first time,purely because of how classy the show was throughout.The show had twists and turns,so that till the very last episode you have no idea about the outcome of the story.Walter White stars as a pitiful cancer patient and turns out to be perhaps,the worst criminal on TV(someone everyone would want to see the back of).Every episode offers something more exciting than the previous.Breaking Bad should be what defines TV in the 21st century without a doubt.Brilliantly written,equally very well acted and hats off for that man Vince Gilligan for exploring one of the most disgusting business in a way that anyone of all ages could enjoy
