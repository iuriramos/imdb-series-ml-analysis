Absolutely amazing show. If you're one of the seven people that haven't yet seen this show, let's make that number go down to six. People frequently talk about the decline of television, "Back in my day, we had good shows I Love Lucy, now there's only Jersey Shore and American Idol." This show cancels out any garbage "reality" shows that are on TV right now. Many consider this show to be another anti-hero show, and I'd have to disagree. Without spoiling anything, the main character of this show, Walter White, has very little redeemable qualities by the end of the final season. While this is listed as Drama, this show is not some boring cop procedural, it can be viewed as a (very) Dark Comedy if you want it to be. Only Game of Thrones has achieved as much adoration since Breaking Bad, and I love GoT, but this is just better.
