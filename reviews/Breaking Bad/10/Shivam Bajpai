After watching the series Finale...Its time to post a review about this AWESOME SERIES....Breaking Bad is the best Drama series I have seen till date....The way they ended Season 4, we thought that should be it...but after watching the Series Finale...IT WAS ICING ON THE CAKE.... Its not about Walter or Jessie as a main characters. But each and everyone has given their best shot.Saul, Hank, Gus, Tuco...everyone has delivered their best career performance. At the end, credit goes to Vince who casted the perfect lineup, no wonder 50% of the main cast was in comic stream before this,,,especially Walter and Saul...but Vince pulled it out of em. For me he is the Christopher Nolan of small screen.WE WILL MISS YOU BREAKING BAD ....BADLLLYYYY!!!
