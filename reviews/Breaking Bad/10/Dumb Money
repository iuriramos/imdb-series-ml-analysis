I registered with IMDb just so I could write this review. I am almost finished with Season 5, and I think this may well be the best TV drama of all time. I got onto the bandwagon late, and already knew how it ended when I started watching the show, but that was basically all I knew. I cannot express in words how amazing this show is. There are so many amazingly interesting characters/performances, but I have to say that Esposito as Gus Fring is unbelievably great as a villain, and Bryan Cranston is sublimely flawed and interesting as White. The relationship between White and Pinkman makes the show, and the decision not to kill off Pinkman in the first season is THE thing that turned this show into a phenomenon. Whoever made that decision, I assume Gilligan, turned an interesting and great TV show into an all-time great TV show. "I am the one who knocks" and "I won" are two of the greatest TV-drama lines of all time. 

Minor Quibbles: So far, Idon't think season 5 is as good as the others. I don't really buy that Beneke would just not say anything after what happens with Skyler's guys. 

I know how it ends, I don't think season 5 is quite at the level of the others (so far) and I still cannot wait to finish the series.
