Ever Since the end of Lost I have been in a grim mood searching for a Show that meets my eye, just recently I started watching Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is a work of art, and is easily one of my two favorite dramas. The first season is absolutely mind blowing. Most shows start to drag on and run out of ideas, and start to really crap the bed. Breaking Bad seems to just get stronger through each season, the whole entire show runs on the literary technique of dramatic irony. Meaning the viewer knows something that the characters don't. I find the plot unbelievably creative and realistic. I am extremely excited for the fifth season coming out next summer, season four ended with a bang. Now Vince Gilligan has his hands full with a destined amazing last season.
