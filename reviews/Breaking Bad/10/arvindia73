I'm pretty excited to write the 600th review for Breaking Bad. This show had kept me awake at nights as I wanted to watch just one more episode. It truly is the best of TV shows I have watched.

In terms of acting, Bryan Cranston has beaten everyone in playing the good and the bad. It has been this change in the major characters that leaves you with a weird feeling in the end. You don't even know whether to feel bad, pity on W.W. and Jesse or plain sadness about all that happened. It is this feeling that makes this show one of the greatest. 

I do agree that Season# 3 was a blunder and it kept sort of dragging things up for no reasons, but Season#4 and 5 makes up for anything and everything.

The only verdict that this show can have : The best show ever !!
