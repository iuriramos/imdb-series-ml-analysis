I've watched thousands of movies and TV shows and have to admit, some of them were really great. However; I've never written a review for any of them, watched without sleeping for days, listened the soundtrack, classified a TV show as a movie, watched youtube videos of it's characters and yeah, never written RIP for Walter White!!!! Breaking Bad is a punch in your face. You'll question whats good and bad in life and it will affect your reasoning. Breaking Bad will touch you one way or another, and you'll never forget. 

I no longer enjoy watching a TV show or a so called great movie. Nothing thrills me anymore. Nothing keeps me idle for whats next. Nothing does touch actually. After watching top 100 movies, the top TV shows and many other crap, I can undoubtedly say that it's the greatest production of all times.
