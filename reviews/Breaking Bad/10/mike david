What do you get when you have a chemistry teacher in a mid life crisis, dying of cancer, and washing cars as a second job to make ends meet for his middle class family? One of the greatest television dramas of all time with crazy plot twists, brilliant performances, and unforgettable characters and cinematography.

There is so much to like about the masterpiece that is Breaking Bad. Take your pick: the acting, the writing, the story lines, the plot, the suspense the cliff hangers, the action scenes, the camera work, the characters, the character arcs, the realism, the satirical style, any season, the end, the casting, the dark humor and humor relief, the scenery, the contrast between background and foreground to establish artistic effect (the sun shiny clear blue skies of the NM desert behind the gruesome organized crime and violence of the underworld), the mixing of favorite genres (crime caper, dark comedy, western, noir, horror, suspense, action, drama, thriller, Shakespearean tragedy, dystopia, psychological character study..), the lines/quotes...the list goes on.

What's amazing about Breaking Bad is it begins so humble and quiet, and as it continues to let its' story unfold, it explodes. It gets better and better each season until the end in the final season, we don't know if we're watching a television show or an Academy Award winning motion picture. The show dares to go where no one would have thought it would go- into a transcendent realm of classic cinema- and it pulls it off beautifully.
