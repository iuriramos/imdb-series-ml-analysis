Where do i start with Breaking Bad?! It's flawless, top notch acting? It's amazing cinematography? It's highly original plot? Breaking Bad is still the only TV show to leave me wanting more after every episode and in my opinion, ranks up there with the greatest TV shows ever made.

(This review will not go into detail about the plot) Let's start with the acting. Bryan Cranston is simply amazing in Breaking Bad. I didn't think much of him at first, seeing him in Malcom In The Middle growing up. Cranston fully understands the character of Walter White as i have seen from many interviews with him about Breaking Bad. He steps into Walt's shoes and no one could portray this character better than him. His gradual descent into _____ (won't spoil anything) is something i have never seen before in film as well as TV (He also won 3 Emmy's for the role). The rest of the cast in Breaking Bad is amazing as well (Anna Gunn, Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandht, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Giancarlo Esposito, Steven Michael Quezada and Jonathan Banks)

Breaking Bad has to be one of the most suspenseful shows ever made. Each season gets more and more tense, building up more and more suspense leading explosive cliff-hangers and scenes leaving you on the edge of your seat (especially in seasons 3 and 4). Films classed as 'Suspense-Thrillers' have nothing on Breaking Bad which is classed as a drama.

I recommend Breaking Bad to everyone interested in an original, suspenseful and superbly made drama show. 10/10 :)
