Well, What can I say about this amazing TV series? It is just the best series I have ever seen. I miss Walter White and Jesse Pinkman...

The first season is really good, because Walter is worried about his life and what he is going to do after the news about the cancer.

The second and third seasons they keep very good, but I think that the fact of Walter want to forget the idea to cook meth and turn back all the time is a little tiring...

The fourth season is probably the most moment awaited of all the series. Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring made a great performance and he really looks like a two-faces man. And you never know what he is going to do. The last episode of fourth season is one of the best, but the fans knew that this amazing series couldn't finish like that.

And then, the amazing, unbelievable, incredible and wonderful fifth season came! I don't have enough words to describe this season. Since the first episode and then after each episode it was getting more tense and I had to watch almost the entire season in one or two days.

Hank was a very nice character and all the audience liked him. The same for Mike and Saul... Great job guys!

The last episode is crazy man... First, I would like to say that the soundtrack chosen was amazing. Baby Blue for who want to check it out.

I think the last scene of that series was perfect and I wouldn't do nothing different. The upshot for Walter and Jesse was worthy.

I watched the documentary about the last season and there was a really good environment. When each character made the last scene, they won a picture with autograph by all the team. Sometimes it was very emotional and Bryan Cranston is the funny guy I ever have seen.

Congratulations and thank you for this series. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul is the best TV series pair.
