Breaking Bad would have to be by far the best television series I have ever watched.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching every single episode of the series. My recommendation to anyone reading this who is thinking of watching the show would be to stop reading right now and go watch it. From the first minute of the first episode I was hooked and never looked back at all.

Also, some people would complain about the ending but after re-watching the whole series a second time the ending made perfect sense and was very fitting.

Thank you for reading my review so that I can complete the IMDb profile checklist
