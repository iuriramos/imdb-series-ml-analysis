This show is the most BadAss TV show i ever watched. Awesome script, killer dialogs, best acting...this show has everything it takes to make the best show ever. When i first started watching it, i thought its too slow or seemed like it lacked the spark. The reason was i could not connect to its story but when i did its all i could think and talk about. All the time i used to watch which even made my friend and family addicted to it. And you wont stop saying "Yeah B***H". So believe me its worth the time. Bryan Cranston and AARon Paul made justice to their characters, superb acting...also the other actors did a great job in playing their character. There was never a time where i felt that these characters wouldn't exist in real life. Even though Skyler made me furious sometimes.
