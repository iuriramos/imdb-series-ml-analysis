This show is easily the best show I have ever watched. The story is excellent and is executed to near perfection. From a plot standpoint, it does a brilliant job of having an intriguing overarching plot through all the seasons, while having several mini-plots that get resolved as time goes on each season. It's very easy for a show like this to lose grip with reality, but it does a very good job of not falling off the unrealistic cliff. The characters are played exactly as the story would want them to be. Each character develops throughout the show with some of them creating internal conflict within yourself as to whether they're someone to root for or against. It has enough action to keep you on the edge throughout the show. I also appreciate that the network and writers didn't see its success and try to drag the show on and on. Without providing spoilers, I was very happy with the ending, which can't be said for many shows.
