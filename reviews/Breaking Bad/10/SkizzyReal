Not only is this the greatest thing ever to be on TV screens, its a total game changer. Nobody else will get away with anything substandard anymore, after people have gotten a taste of the good stuff anything less will not satisfy them anymore, just like drug addicts. This show is 99% quality just like Heisenberg's meth. It is impossible to stay emotionally unattached after watching this show, and that's what makes this the greatest show of all time, how will Walt handle everything? The characters are very real and relatable and the acting is brilliant throughout. Breaking Bad is not as popular as the most popular TV shows, because it is just too good and too intelligent, it is ahead of its time but it has brought us to the future of quality TV, everything from this point on will be compared to the greatest TV show that has existed so far.
