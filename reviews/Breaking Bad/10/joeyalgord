This is still easily the best show I have ever seen. Better call Saul was good, but not the same.

Breaking Bad blows Game of Thrones out of the water. It finished perfectly. The entire series is great. Plenty of rewatch value.

The cinematography is great.

Directing is great. Show is very suspenseful. Cliffhangers are relevant and deserving. 

Show has a unique feel to it. Quite spacey.

Take it as it is and you will enjoy.

A masterpiece.

10/10
