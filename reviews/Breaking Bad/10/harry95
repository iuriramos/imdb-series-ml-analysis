Breaking bad managed to give me a rare, greedy feeling of wanting to watch more and more, but not wanting it to end. Never before have I felt so attached to every character; while at the same time being in total awe of the symbolism, depth, and balance between light comical moments and very dark scenes which have been seamlessly woven into the script. 

Looking back on the journey through the lives of the characters in Albuquerque, I cant help but feel a real sense of nostalgia. 

Well done to everyone who was involved in the creation of this series. To me this is the greatest television show ever created. This series crosses the boundary between television and fine art.
