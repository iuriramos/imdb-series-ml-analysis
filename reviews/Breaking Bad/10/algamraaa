I think Breaking Bad is one of the best shows in the recent years that reflected the ever lasting conflict between good and evil. Highly presented to the audience; screenplay, story facts, acting crew and directing. All aspects of this work have always proved being on top of everything else that's being played as these episodes keep you excited with curiosity every time one of them is on! Simply amazing...! In relation with violence as a factor that keeps growing bigger in each episode, where comes the smartness of this work, you find yourself supportive to such acts as a point of sympathy with the characters, where - at the end - are pure criminal acts! This work puts you in real conflict with yourself, sometimes, as you keep trying to understand the necessity to survive by practicing all morally wrong things you've ever known in your life!
