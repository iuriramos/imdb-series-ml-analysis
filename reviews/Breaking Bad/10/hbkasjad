When I started watching this show I had never thought such a concept would attract me that much but as I watched I thought to myself how could I have missed such a show. It is the best in comparison to any show I've watched. Be it Game Of Thrones or The Wire, this is better. The direction of Vince Gilligan is extraordinary. I love the way he has characterized the people in this show. 

Bryan Cranston is a clean winner. However his character may be, he is the best that there is. There is absolutely no comparison in terms of greatness with such a character or actor in the cast. Aaron Paul has done an amazing job as well. He has played the role Jesse as it should have been. You name any character and he/she has done a great job. Giancarlo Esposito is one of the best and baddest villain created. Everyone must definitely watch this show. Every season gets better.
