The specialty of this show is, the consistency. Through out the series(except for 'Fly';was bit of boring)in every episode the suspense, intelligence in every second of the script was displayed.

I would say almost every character did a fabulous job. Walter White, Jr. White, Hank, Jesse, Todd's crew, Skyler, Mile, Gus were exceptional.

I think the show scores highly, with the perfect end of the show. Some people say the show has a tragic end, but some people say it doesn't. Isn't that awesome. A show has a fabulous end and different dimensions to the end.
