If you are a bit like me you might think that a TV series on drugs can't be very interesting. However I've been proved wrong. This show is the most intense, profound and brilliant show I have ever seen.

Describing this show is not easy though. What makes it this special? To me it is the psychological depth of the characters, the progression of life stories and the small and large scale snowball effects in response to choices being made.

I'm not a professional in filming techniques, but even I can see that Breaking Bad is also unique in camera work. Unusual angles are used to shoot a different than usual series and little imperfections are cherished instead of polished away. This series shows wrinkles, body hair and moles. Just as it shows people making little normal daily mistakes, that don't add to the story but make it look so much more natural. 

To conclude I'd say if this TV series was a book it would be literature, so it is definitely a must watch!
