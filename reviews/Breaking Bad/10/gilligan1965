The thing, the 'only' thing, I didn't like about AMC's TV series was that you had to watch them in succession; and, at the time "The Sopranos" and "Breaking Bad" came out, I didn't have On Demand, so, I missed a few episodes.

Anyhow, after watching various episodes of both shows, I knew that they were great, so...I bought the DVD series when they were available and watched them in order.

This is an impeccable show with great characters and crew, and, some, not so great as with any show (villains and pain-in-the-butt characters); but, overall, I dare anyone to top this show.

Can anyone believe that the creator/writer/director of this show wrote the script for the movie "Hancock;" and, later, "Better Call Saul!?!?" Vince Gilligan is very much like Quentin Tarantino - a 'do-it-all-yourself' kinda guy.

Did anyone ever notice that the actor of Walter White was in "Saving Private Ryan" and "Malcolm in the Middle" (very versatile actor); the actor of Mike Ehrmantraut was in "Beverly Hills Cop;" the actor of Hank Schrader was in "The Negotiator;" and, the actor of Gustavo 'Gus' Fring was in "Trading Places?" I love figuring out 'who is who' in movies and TV shows, and, this is a 'who's who' of great actors!

This is an incredible TV series...and, if you like directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, Clint Eastwood, Oliver Stone, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and, Guy Ritchie...and, the minds of Alfred Hitchcock, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and, Rod Serling - you'll certainly like this TV series...guaranteed! :)

This series could'a and should'a went on much, much longer!
