It doesn't happen very often that I'm not sad when a TV show ends: I'm not sad just because Breaking Bad could not have been done better. There are 5 season, and each one is good. They succeeded in keeping an high level for the whole TV show duration. It is never expect, never trivial. There are no good or evil men, no black or white, but everything is gray, every character is perfectly built. Bryan Cranston...what could I say? I think him to be one of the most talented actors in the world. You don't know if to love or to hate him. The most part of today TV shows are full of nudity, violence etc., but Breaking Bad had a great success also without these elements: there should be a reason, don't you think? If you want to find out what it is, just watch it, you will not regret this! Enjoy it!
