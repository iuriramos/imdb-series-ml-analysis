Breaking Bad will never fail to surprise you. You will see some of the finest acting seen in a show by Bryan Cranston. You will also see the rise of Hollywood actor Aaron Paul. Breaking Bad breaks boundaries, the change of Walter White into one 'Heisenberg' is truly phenomenal. Every cast member is not only good but amazing. I cannot mention some villains to Walt and Jesse as it will ruin the experience, every villain makes you hate them but will possibly make you root for their purpose because Vince Gilligan presents why each villain does what they do. Season one and two may seem slow but all will come together as season three, four and five will make the show tense, gripping, shocking and yet so enjoyable. So if you don't find the start to be of your taste continue to watch and the wait will be worth it! This show is simply the best.

All Hail The King,Walter White.
