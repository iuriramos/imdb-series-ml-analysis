I live in Australia and was not aware that this show existed, it is not shown on commercial TV here, I was given Season 1 on DVD for Christmas, I have now just finished Season 4... this Drama has everything a viewer could want, but it has been crafted like no other drama series I've ever seen. I know it has comparison's to Weeds, Dexter and Sopranos, but comparing BB to these shows, just doesn't do Breaking Bad true justice. The best word I can come up with is "breathtaking", and for so many reasons, the writing, the character development, the performances, even the production values... Vince Gilligan must be Shakespeare's and The Coen brothers love child, there can be no other explanation, the combination of pathos and inventive story telling is remarkable. Every character good or bad has true hidden depth, a true to life mixture of every emotion it's possible to convey, what is so unnerving is that we see through to the true humanity of every meth head, dealer, prostitute or street urchin, even the hungry 7 year old in the crack house in season two was 'perfect'... Cranston is remarkable because he stands head and shoulders above the rest, his ability to convey to us as his audience every emotion he is feeling, while keeping everyone - family - friend or foe, completely in the dark about his true intentions, is just flawless. 10 out of 10 is not a high enough score for this true American classic. I believe season 5 will be the last? If so I applaud Gilligan for having the integrity to not let this show descend into commercialized dribble - knowing just when to finish a perfect portrait is the signature of a great artist.
