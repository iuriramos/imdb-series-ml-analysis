Let me start this review by saying that in my opinion Breaking Bad is the best TV show ever made.

Breaking Bad is about Walter White, a Chemistry Teacher who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. To provide for his family's future he uses his knowledge to cook and sell crystal meth with his ex-student Jesse Pinkman. 

The story moves to such unexpected places as Walt and Jesse are dragged deeper and deeper into the criminal underworld. I would recommend that you don't read too much about Breaking Bad as you may come across huge spoilers, this may ruin parts of the story as the show is so unpredictable.

Breaking Bad starts off very well and improves with every season. Breaking Bad can be fairly slow sometimes, but there is also a good amount of action in each season to make up for it. Breaking Bad never really feels slow, in the later seasons it uses time wisely to build suspense and tension which makes the action have so much more impact. The show is thrilling and extremely addictive.

Each actor is absolutely superb and Bryan Cranston gives the performance of a lifetime as we watch the slow evolution of Walter White from an underachieving Chemistry Teacher to a Bad-Ass Criminal Mastermind. Aaron Paul gives Jesse depth and after a while he becomes the most likable and sympathetic character on the show. The entire cast is stellar and they really suck you into the story.

The direction and cinematography are stunning which give Breaking Bad a visual style that is unmatched by any other show. The music by Dave Porter is also excellent and really adds to the suspense.

Vince Gilligan and his writing team have created a masterpiece which improves as it goes on and ends with the best series finale I have ever seen. I cannot recommend this show highly enough. In my opinion it is not only the greatest show ever made, but it is also the best show that will ever be made.
