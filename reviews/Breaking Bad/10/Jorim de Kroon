This review doesn't contain any spoilers, because I wouldn't forgive myself if I ruined this show for anyone! 

First of all I want to thank the cast, crew and Vince Gilligan for the best 47 hours of television of my whole life. I am flabbergasted about the fact that it really pulled me in from the beginning to the end and it will never let me go entirely. The characters are so well played and the script is so ingenious. I have no words for how great this show is. This was a perfect ending for a perfect show. This show really is about transformation, misery and happiness. It really, really got me, I am just too full of it now, but I felt like writing a review. So if you haven't watched this show and your looking for something good: this is more than a recommendation! For everyone who has watched breaking bad, I wish you all the best of luck on getting your life on track now that this show is over. Frankly, it will be very hard for me.

Thank you breaking bad!
