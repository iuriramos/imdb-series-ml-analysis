The entire series becomes addictive after watching a couple of episodes of first season. It reaches its peak in the last two seasons.

The journey of Walter white is like a roller coaster ride and the intelligence of the character mesmerizes you.

I had a marathon course while watching it and by the time i finished I felt the same way it feels like finishing a good book. 

The best part is you are introduced to interesting characters all way and most of them make an impact as much as the lead characters. 

The creators have made a good story and the scenes and direction of each episode is flawless.. I happened to watch the story making time-lapse video of an episode of breaking bad and truly appreciate the effort put into it. 

I can undoubtedly say that this is the best TV show I ever watched and a highly addictive one. This is simply not a series to be missed.
