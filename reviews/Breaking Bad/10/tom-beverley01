Firstly, I have never rated anything 10 stars before. But Breaking Bad has defiantly changed my life. It's one of those shows where, if you start trying to review it properly, you'll go on for ages just telling the story. So I'll try my best to keep this as short and sweet as possible.

BB just ticks all the boxes. Drama, Suspense, Action, Comedy, Romance. You name it, this show has it. Creator Vince Gilligan has brought TV dramas up to a whole new level. The depth of complexity and amazing knowledge that comes from this man is unbelievable. And the acting; it's just out of this world. Both Cranston and Paul are in a league of their own. I have never seen such an amazing good -> bad portrayal as what 3 time Emmy winner Bryan Cranston has shown here. And the emotional depth of three time Emmy winner Aaron Paul, just shows that there is hope for American TV. 

So, why should you watch Breaking Bad? All you need to know is: 151 Emmy nominations, 50 wins. 3 consecutive wins for Cranston and award for best original drama series in 2013.
