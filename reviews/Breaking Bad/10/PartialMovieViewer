I have just started watching reruns of this program and so far like it. After reading some comments I figured maybe I should hold off before giving this program 10 thumbs up. And then I figured, 'what the heck?' I usually write about a show the first time I see it anyway, and I will doll out accolades now. For later shows  my opinion may change  but for now  I really enjoyed the pilot and the early programs I have seen. The writing and acting all seems exceptional. The guys was a winner and is now a loser, spiraling further downward. And I bet there are a lot more out there now-a-days with such a poor economy. Well let them eat cake  right? Anyways, the terminal cancer this guy has; seems to give him the right to cause pain and misery and death to others he disagrees with or just plain doesn't like. Since this is fiction, I can look beyond that. Come-on, this is a dark comedy at its best. From week-to-week (or episode-to-episode) the stories keep me coming back for more. Weird or not-weird, that is what I want in a show. When I finally catch up to everyone else  I hope there is nothing there that will turn me off  but if there is  I will duly edit these comments.

UPDATE: I have made it most of the way through the first season and it is beginning to become draggy. Thank you whoever invented the fast-forward switch
