It is fascinating to read all these reviews of Breaking Bad from people who wondered if it would manage to maintain the same level of quality throughout the 2nd and 3rd season.

Having talked with many other Breaking Bad fanatics about the subject, I have yet to find a "binge watcher" who saw the last episode of Season 3 (Full Measure) and did not immediately purchase and watch Season 4, Episode 1 (Box Cutter) no matter how much money they had, and no matter what time they had to be at work the next day.

The ending of the show (after five seasons) is absolutely perfect (with background music by Badfinger "Baby Blue).

The best episode of the show in my opinion is Season 3, Episode 7 (One Minute).

I don't think I have ever seen anything that hit me so hard, with the hard, jerking camera pan into the distance and the insistent car alarm during the ultra violent climax. Absolutely brilliant!

Not to detract from "Full Measure" which undoubtedly caused many people to have a very bad day at work the next day.

BTW, Jonathan Banks (Mike), given his brilliant acting in this series, is perhaps the most underrated actor in either TV or film at the moment.

And that is a real Philadelphia accent. I was born there!
