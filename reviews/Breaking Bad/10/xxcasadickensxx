I feel i have to write this review, to many times in life writers, directors, actors and the little old camera man don't get the prise they deserve. Breaking Bad for me scores a 10 in every department. All there hard work came together in latest feast of drama, intrigue and action. A true master piece of television which will surly heat up the debate, has the modern day TV series overtaken the Movie as the most entertaining media. With the likes of Broadwalk Empire and Game of thrones, does the Movies still offer us the public quality entertainment or mismatch of special effects and poor story lines.......
