i am a high school student who was taking honors chemistry when someone told me about this show on netflix. the first weekend i sat down to watch an episode i ended up watching the entire first season. this show is something completely different. the plot is so elaborate and well thought out, it feels like an endless movie more than a TV show. the way vince gilligan was able to create a show that contained every time of emotion you can feel is truly amazing. i became a huge fan of this show and after watching the first episode i was hooked until the end. brian cranston does am amazing job as walter white and is able to depict this moral transformation that white goes through in a way i have never seen before on a television screen. this show has set the bar for future televion. honestly no other show is even close. breaking bad is without a doubt a 10, and even though amc's other show "the walking dead" is great, its a 6 compared to gilligans masterpiece. I've never seen a show so perfectly executed. i made an IMDb account just so i could review the best thing television has ever seen.
