This show is simply flawless!!! They have picked brilliant actors who were really amazing!!! None of them were famous but they gave a magnificent performance, better than many Hollywood actors!! Especially Aaron Paul, he came from nowhere but amazed everybody!! His astonishing performance made us laugh,and even cry!! I think he is a very talented actor who deserves a 3rd Emmy, better than all the other nominees! As a conclusion, This show really deserves a 10.0 evaluation!!

P.S: Thanks for Vince Gilligan for creating this wonderful show!! It is the most brilliant show I have ever seen in my entire life! I hope {Better Call Saul} be just as wonderful as this show is!!
