I watched all of Breaking Bad twice. Why? Because this show is so addicting, it never gets old. It's a drama, but it isn't afraid to add on some comedy on there. Like when Walter smokes Jesse's weed, that was just hilarious! And the 'meme' of how Walt Jr. loves breakfast, hilarious.

But, one of my main reasons I love this show so much, is how Jesse and Walter's relationship grew, and had it's ups and downs. Walter grew into caring about him.Protecting Jesse, when he didn't need to. He could've easily ditched him when Jesse was in trouble but he never left, he was like family, you never leave family. Even when in the fifth season, when Jesse tried to torch his house, Walter didn't want him dead. Like he said, 'He isn't just some Rabid Dog.' He truly believed that Jesse could come to his senses. 

Another thing, is the tracks they picked was catchy, and made a lot of scenes, so bad ass! (ex. stay out of my territory scene) It was spot on, and the POV's was amazing.

Another thing I absolutely loved about this show. The ending. At the ending, it tied up (well, most of them) loose ends, and it had some moments of revenge, like how Walt killed Jack in mid-sentence like how he did with Hank. Perfect ending, for a perfect show.
