It has been almost a year since I finished watching Breaking Bad for the first time.There are few incidents in everyone's life which make us thankful to be alive. Watching Breaking Bad was one such incident for me. Be it the absolutely marvellous Bryan Cranston as Walter White, the chemistry between Mr. White and Jesse Pinkman or the impeccable direction in almost every episode, everything was picture perfect. I am sure episodes like Ozymandias, Felina, Dead Freight and Face-off are some of the greatest hours on Television.

Breaking Bad is without a doubt the best thing I have watched on television till date. The quality of Vince Gilligan's creation is as great as the Walter White's crystal meth, completely exhilarating.
