First of all I am not a fan of TV series , specially if it is like 5 seasons or more. But from the very fist episode of Breaking Bad I knew there is something different in here. The story and dialogue will grip you from the first episode till the end...The Idea is very new , you will be confused with the Walter's personality through the episode.. you don't know whether to agree or disagree with him. the dialogue is brilliant as when you listen you will agree with the ideas in it but it will leave you uncertain about the main concept. I give Walter, Jesse, Hank 10/10, Skyler and Marie 6/10. their performance is not convincing or they set up them like that, I don't know but at least Skyler is better than Marie. The season 5 is best of the best , each move, each word should be studied well.
