I have watched Breaking bad fully through I think 3 times now and I love it to bits! Breaking bad has very talented actors and actresses and the famous cool camera shots, that I love. Watching every character on the show develop from the beginning is amazing, also the music used in it is perfect, I listen to those songs from it all the time. I even watched Malcolm in the middle because I was so desperate to see Bryan Cranston after the finale... I watched every singe interview with Bryan Cranston, Jonathan Banks, Aaron Paul and also many other actors and actresses from the show.. I did every Breaking bad quiz I found... MAN! I even "studied" the different meanings behind colors and hidden symbols from the show. I was literally obsessed with Breaking bad... It is simply the best TV show to ever appear on our TV screens ever! PS. I probably sound crazy but I promise Im not, Im just a huge fan of Breaking bad. Have a nice day!
