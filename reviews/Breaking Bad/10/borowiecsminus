Vince Gilligan's masterpiece of a show titled "Breaking Bad" is the greatest collection of television episodes ever assembled into one show. The directing, primarily done by either Vince Gilligan or George Mastras, is some of the greatest in television. Particularly, the episode "Ozymandias," directed by Rian Johnson, is both the greatest episode in the series, and quite possibly of television in general. It was written by Moira-Walley Beckett, who took home the Emmy for it. The acting throughout the show, particularly from Bryan Cranston, is without a doubt the greatest in television history. The writing is realistic yet suspenseful and dramatic, something hard to pull off in television. The level of thought the producers put into the show at every step of the way is simply magnificent beyond comprehension. The best show to ever hit the small screen in every way conceivable. 

All hail our God Vince Gilligan. -Timothy Walter
