I usually do not watch TV, and I happened to catch the first episode of Breaking Bad while flipping channels. After watching the first episode I was completely hooked. For me, there are only a few TV shows which can do that. I was lucky to catch the first episode from the beginning. For the ones who missed, the first season DVD is out now. Go buy it.

Breaking Bad is a dark psychological drama (although actually it doesn't really fit into any genre easily..) with some great moments of equally dark humour. Right now, I think it is different from anything else on TV. The story line is certainly nothing that has ever been done before. It is all original.

The cast are all exceptional and the casting is spot on. Bryan Cranston is absolutely brilliant portraying average middle class dad, Walt. He plays it so numb, then breaks bad with such force. Excellent performance from an excellent actor. Similarly, as Walt's former student Jesse, Aaron Paul shows what a great actor he is. This also goes for Dean Norris who I last saw him in Starship Troopers, long time ago. He does an outstanding job as Hank.

Overall it is definitely great television... and is incredibly addicting.
