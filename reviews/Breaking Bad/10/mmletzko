I just watched this recently - not sure how I missed it when it was originally broadcast.

This series will put you on an emotional roller coaster of epic proportions. You'll change your mind over and over again with how you feel about certain characters, but in a good way. By the time it's over you will feel completely satisfied with everything.

The acting was phenomenal, as was the story. Bravo to all those who were involved in making this series.

You will NOT be disappointed.

Looking forward to what happens in the spin off of "Better Call Saul"!
