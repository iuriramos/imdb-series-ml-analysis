actors are fantastic in this thrilling melting pot of intrigue and mystery. cranston knows what's up in this modern classic as he faces moral dilemmas and insurmountable odds. from episode to episode the action ratchets up and up fill your mind with questions and incredulous tangents. i couldn't peel my eyes from the screen, i was worried that i might hurt my eyes. all joking aside, to be alive during the premiere airing of this monumental show is a gift. every Sunday is Christmas as far as i'm concerned. but what's great about this show is in the watching of it and not the reading of this review. thought-provoking and mind-blowing. i haven't been this excited about a television program since stargate. must-see extravaganza!
