Breaking Bad is so far one of my top ten, top five even, favorite shows ever. The story is so deep, but in the end of all of it you realize: this is what some people are really doing right now with their life. Whether we realize it or not, as entertaining and fascinating Breaking Bad can be, we live in a world that truly contains the struggles, addictions, and lifestyles shown on such an amazing show.

Breaking Bad should forever be considered a grand and original show, with such a moving, powerful, and exciting storyline. This show isn't just about meth, death, and sex (trust me I've heard enough people who haven't watched the show say so). For anybody browsing IMDb right now here in Breaking Bad reviews, I hope anybody reading mine right now knows how much they need, NEED, to begin this series. Now go log on to your Netflix, you're gonna binge watch this for sure.
