JUST an amazing piece of work. From the beginning, Walt remains methodical in his attempt and success to rise in the "Empire" business. Jesse Pinkman, (Aaron Paul) delivers a great break out performance as a troubled man who gets blackmailed into working with his old High School Chemistry teacher, Walter White. He gets dragged deeper into a dark world of, drugs, cartel, guns, Crazy 8, Uncle Tio and more. I freaking love this show. From the chicken brothers, Los Pollos Hermanos, to Todd, a creepy boy next door looking kid with evil intentions and family. Glad to call many of the cast my friends.The Salamanca twins, Daniel and Luis Moncada pull off a superb performance. Breath taking. This show has you sitting on edge every episode.
