By Far the Best Show on TV Ever! The show captures you from the very first scene of the very first episode. Week after week I sat on the edge of my seat as Breaking Bad would unfold in HD and the beauty of New Mexico combined with the masterful writing and cinematography left me breathless. I laughed, I cried, I got mad, I got sad, I was stunned but through it all I totally enjoyed every episode. The show is so solid in every aspect it's a treat to watch and enjoy. From the Pilot of Breaking Bad in 2008 Season 1 to "Felina" the sixteenth episode of the fifth season of Breaking Bad and the sixty-second episode of the series altogether. It is the final episode of the series. It's been a bittersweet ride. I love this show and now that it's over I'm burning my TV.
