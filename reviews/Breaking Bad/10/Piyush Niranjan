The writing never falters throughout the course of the five seasons.the show goes on we realize that there's a lot more to his character than just a clever chemist trying to leave a legacy. First you will like this guy Walter White, then you will pity him, then you start feeling good for him when he starts becoming a bad-ass, then you will despise him for he goes too far too brutal in his actions.It's a fantastic concept and watching a character develop and change. AS WALTER SAID-CHEMISTRY IS A STUDY OF MATTER....AND WHAT HE PREFER TO SEE IT AS A CHANGE...THIS WHOLE LINE EXPLAINS EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF HIS LIFE.... AND I FLATTER WHAT VINCE SHOWS US THE REALITY NOT A FANTASY WORLD....

Its not just a TV show Breaking Bad is an experience.
