This show starts off slow-fast and then starts to get crazy never in my life seen a show take of like this! this show deserves every award for everything it dishes out, you just don't know how crazy it can go until the unexpected happens. If some how? they killed off the head actors at the end of the show for a reason so they can keep doing what they are doing but made it in a 2hr movie and started it off with faking there deaths? and some how did it! would be a #1 movie to go see, I've seen this show yrs ago but never started watching it because just didn't have the time and thought it was just another show that wont last long but! i was wrong in every way and cant wait until i start watching season 4 tomorrow, please don't let the first season disappoint you and think its a nothing show because its far from that, this show has to fit into your personality in some way. GOOD LUCK
