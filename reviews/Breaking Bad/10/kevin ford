I initially passed on Breaking Bad thinking it was the typical Hollywood glorification of bad behavior & drug dealing. I truly was prejudice because of the title name(Breaking Bad) and the current garbage that was on TV. Well anyway, the final episode and conclusion made the rounds on cable news discussions and I was curious how it ended. I knew the basic plot, a chemistry teacher is diagnosed with terminal cancer and decides to break bad with a former student to sell drugs in order to leave his family with some money. By chance I watched the final episode and I was immediately impressed with the quality and cinematography, as well as the overall texture of the show. I then watched the final season on a cable TV binge and was hooked. I then watched the show from beginning to end several times since.

Breaking Bad is the best show ever. The show stays with you. For the next 10 years people will be discussing what made it so good. So much has already been said about the show but I will like to add my 2 cents. What made the show so enjoyable for me was the analysis of the characters and what made them do what they did. As a viewer, I felt a responsibility to analyze the characters in a way I've never did before. I was challenged to see deeper into these TV show characters like I have never previously did while watching a TV show. The characters are complex and aren't for the stupid. This show is truly unprecedented in my opinion. I would only compare Breaking Bad to The Beatles music catalog, that is it's consistent quality that constantly changes and provides great entertainment for the viewer. Truly Breaking Bad is a masterpiece for the ages.
