Pure ten! The quality of the series just goes on and that the plot is progressing which is really rare. The second half of the 4th season and complete the fifth top peaks, no bad episodes, tense, almost every episode superb finishes. The entire fifth complete the best season ever! There dare I say it! Acting excellent, the script also. Come on, so I will not tell anything new. Oh details! Oh, how I was pleased to follow, some small detail may not go after him, but I just go and when you notice something and completed it and it turns out you're right. : yay: I greatly appreciate what they decided to do (only) season 5, but frickin good, than prostitute through the 10 or so season just for the money and viewer ship. The first season was the worst when compared to others. Warmly recommended. Malcolms father can really act
