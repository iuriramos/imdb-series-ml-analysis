What a magnificent series. Powerless anti-hero fighting against society and his terminal disease. Professing that everything he does is for his family but secretly,selfishly wants and requires all the hurt and suffering he inflicts on himself and others. Through the series we have seen terrible changes but still, outside of this tragedy, the world continues. Are we satisfied that the evil characters have been destroyed, do we want the anti-hero to continue in his endeavours? No and yes (in that order).I desperately wanted the Salamander brothers to continue their colourful death spree. I begged the Gods to spare Gus, Mike was the coolest bad guy ever - he should have survived.But in the BB universe the meth labs will continue, some other Walt will emerge from the ether, Jesse will mentor Brock, Skylar has Jnr and Holly. We have witnessed an Epic tale and are ultimately satisfied.
