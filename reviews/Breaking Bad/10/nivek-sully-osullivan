Vince Gilligan has created the best written, best acted, and most beautiful visually T.V. show on the planet. Walter White, has an unbelievably remarkable story arc executed perfectly. This is the same for each and every character on the show. The quality of the cinematography is spectacular and has not been matched by a show to date. A perfect example is the scene after the bomb has gone off in the nursing home. Gus walks out of the hospital room and adjusts his tie out of habit, then the camera changes perfectly exhibiting the true skill of everyone on the show. There is no show better than Breaking Bad and I doubt a show will reach the quality for a long time.
