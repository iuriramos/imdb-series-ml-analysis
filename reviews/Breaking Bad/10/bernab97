Breaking Bad, the first season is MIND BLOWING, and as you go you think it can't get any better but you are wrong. As you go on to the next seasons you start to see this character transformation in Walter White and how he gets sucked in into the world of crystal me-th. You start to see how much he cares about his business and the longer you go the darker the seasons get. Breaking bad is a MASTERFUL work of art that is brilliantly written and has a great story. This is definitely one of the best televisions drama shows that has been created and you can never go wrong with breaking bad if you want to watch a good show. Breaking bad is simply great and will blow your mind in several occasions. I truly recommend Breaking Bad for every one,and to quote Walter White "I am not afraid of danger, because I AM danger"
