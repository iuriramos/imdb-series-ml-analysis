Ever since Tony Montana i was not thrilled until i saw the performance of Bryan Cranston as Walter White. The series begins with a chemistry teacher who is detected with terminal cancer. On his 50th birthday, Walter, along with his family which includes DEA agent, watches a local news report about a methamphetamine drug bust and is impressed by the amount of money recovered from the dealers. Walter considers secretly cooking meth as a way to ensure his family has money and security after he dies. He accompanies Hank as a ride-along during a DEA drug bust against a local dealer named "Cap'n Cook". During the bust, Walt sees a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), fleeing from the scene, and realizes that Jesse is the dealer Hank is investigating. Using the school's records, Walt tracks down Jesse and blackmails him into letting him enter the drug trade.[16] The two form a partnership in which Walt will manufacture meth and Jesse will sell it, producing the product in an RV that Jesse purchases with Walt's life savings.

Very recommended series. The actors performance is great.
