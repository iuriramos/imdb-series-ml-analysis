A classic of our time, one of, if not THE greatest show put on television. I can't speak for it being better to other shows like "The Sopranos" or "Sons of Anarchy", but there's a reason it's #3 on the Top 250 TV shows. A modern day Shakespearian tragedy with drama, suspense, and action to spare. There's not enough I can say about how great this show is. Out of 62 episodes I gave 25 of them 10 stars, and only 1 episode below 6 stars. I've already made a "Top 20 Best Episodes" list, so I'll cover the only episode of the series I wouldn't watch again here. 

The only episode that I wouldn't consider watching again is "Cancer Man". The reason being is that next to nothing happens. Walt tells the rest of his family that he has cancer, sure, but there wasn't enough in the episode to keep me engaged for 45 minutes. You could literally skip this episode and just say he told his family off camera, that little happens. Jesse's part of the story is also pointless. Sure we see his parents in other episodes, but they never mention him staying with them in this episode ever again. I know the first season was cut short due to a writer's strike, and I'm sure that had an effect on this episode's quality, but I still don't see it as that important.

Other than that one episode though, the rest of the series is near flawless. If you have not seen this, you owe it to yourself to see it. Avoid the spoilers, avoid the fan theories, and just watch this blind like I did, without any opinion going in, you won't regret it.

Long live Heisenberg.
