I love this series and it is true to it is title. It is about a good man that breaking bad by just trying to be helping his family. It does make you see that breaking bad is one step at a time thing and sometimes it may start with good intentions.

I must say that I have been watching the recorded version of the show for the most part and that I had to fast-forward over some gruesome parts in order to enable myself to follow it after avoiding for a long time.

The acting is superb. The plots are highly inventive. The dialog is well written.

I don't think that it could have been done any better this.

What I find that is hard to believe, is that I am watching it. Only this year after watching this series I have been able to watch gruesome crime shows which I have avoided most of my life.

Now I am catching up on TV crime shows and having watched a few, this is the best one of the lot and highly unique.
