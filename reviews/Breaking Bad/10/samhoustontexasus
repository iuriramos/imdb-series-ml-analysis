This is not a serial. It is actually a 45+ hours long movie!!!! Well, I haven't exactly counted the hours and minutes, but 62 episodes, each approx. 45 minutes, so give or take...

Very intriguing and unique plot, superb direction, perfect castings and superior performance of all casts. But the three actors are by far the most outstanding of all. They are 1) Arron Paul playing Jessie Pinkman, 2) Dean Morris playing DEA Agent Hank Schrader and 3) Bob Odenkirk as Lawyer Saul Goodman. When these actors are on the screen, you couldn't take your eyes off them. If Breaking Bad was actually a movie, these three would be De facto owners of Oscar nominations. They are razor sharp in their respective characters. Bob Odenkirk has striking resemblance of Adam Sandler and he is superbly funny.

Every episode keeps full grip on you. Barring a few short fillers, all episodes are non-stop intense and grasp your full attention.

This is the "Shawshank Redemption" of TV serials! Every one must watch.
