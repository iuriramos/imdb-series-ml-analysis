I've watched this series twice now, and the acting and writing are so good, that I can defy you to watch this and not love it!!!!

The season ending episode, is so good, that even after having watched it maybe 10 times now, I still pick up little things that I did not catch the first times around.

The last few minutes are RIVETING... to say the least, and the very last scene in the met lab, when they started the music from Badfinger, was so spot on, that even the words to the song, described Walt to a T!!!

It is a long series ( 62 episodes ), but personally I wish it would have never ended, it is that good!
