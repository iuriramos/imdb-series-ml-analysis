When I started watching the show I was excited to see Hal from Malcolm in the Middle (Bryan Cranston), as Malcolm is still my favorite comedy series. It never bores me to re-watch and that is something that makes a show amazing for me. On the other hand, I simply cannot re-watch again Breaking Bad, I can with a friend, but not alone. It's not that it's anything close to bad of whatever, it just has that strange effect of awesomeness that I cannot even begin to explain. IF I could wish to forget something, I would wish to forget Breaking Bad so that I can watch it all over again. In the beginning I did not understand whether it was a drama, comedy, thriller and by the end I still cannot determine. There are moments of everything, but in general it is just plain genius. I'm not gonna repeat the synopsis, but let me just say that once you start watching it and I'm not saying watching only 1st and 2nd episode, but give it several more you'll understand how unique is this show from every other you've seen. I guess one way to describe it is that it is now far from really and what really can happen. There also other just fantastic shows but not a lot can have everything perfect, the ending being the toughest part probably. Breaking Bad nails it brilliantly here as well. It was sad to know that this amazing show is ending, but it is sadder to see a great show just being ruined by prolonging it unnecessarily. The end of this one though, completes the whole package in an astonishing way.

One last word for the casting - Bryan, Aaron, Anna, Dean, Bob all play phenomenal job, it was like they were born for these roles and none else. If you've seen Malcolm in the Middle, you have a great treat to see the difference in Bryan's roles and how he plays them.
