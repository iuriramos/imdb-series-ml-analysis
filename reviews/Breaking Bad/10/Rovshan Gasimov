Heisenberg! Yes, exactly! This Heisenberg will never be forgotten! I cannot really imagine better TV Show than this. Originality of this show is excellent. 

I cannot say that first two seasons are really great, but after 2nd season it is great! Last 10 episodes i watched in one day... I just loved it. After finishing i watched some movies in a few days and i really was thinking about Breaking Bad and not even paying attention to that movies. 

I strongly recommend this show to everyone. Every single detail are shown clearly. Everything is linked to each other. Very clever show and the story is great. Cinematography is excellent. This show is unbelievable! 

Heisenberg "Broke" it "Bad"!
