Do yourself a favor and watch arguably one of the best, highest rated, most award nominated/award winning shows ever. I probably don't need to tell you about the plot, because most people know what it is, but in case you don't know, Walter White, a high school Chemistry teacher, and Jessie, his old high school student, meet up and work together with Walters knowledge of Chemistry, and Jessies' street knowledge, they build a meth empire. Each season has its own story arch, revolving around a different character or idea, and each season is more intense than the last. This show also has some of the best acting I've ever seen. And all of it is on Netflix. You know what to do.
