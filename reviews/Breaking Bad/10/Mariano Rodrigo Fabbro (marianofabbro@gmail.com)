It's simple. I've never been so hooked up with a series in a my life. Since I watched the first episode in season 1, I couldn't stop watching it. Vince Gilligan did a fantastic work here. The written is a piece of art. The opening theme is sticky. The characters, the script, the actors, the locations, the shots... it's ALL WELL DONE! Every minute, every second is enjoyable. Want to know my truth? today I finished watching all seasons, and I can't imagine my life going on without more seasons of Breaking Bad. I'm sad, because I will miss Mr. White and Mr. Pinkman.

This is the best series in history.
