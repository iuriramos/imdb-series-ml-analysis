Breaking Bad is as ominous and poignant as it is amusing and flippant, the escapades of the Chemistry Genius High school teacher gone rogue with an ex student is as comical as it is meaningful, but what really provides is how striking this series is as an enigmatically exceptional production that ceases to amaze on both levels of scope and scale.

From the beginning to the end Breaking Bad exceeds to captivate and involve the audience cognitively and materialistically, each episode holds equal to importance and intrigue; the choreography illustrates masterful simplicity in coherence with the plot. Throughout the series the audience is played emotionally. Empathy and apathy play fundamental roles in the portrayal of characters that never once become a tedious appendage to the bigger picture, even less significant roles are imposed as impacting and spur charisma and diversity into a story line that at first glance seems rudimentary.

Walter White, the main role in Breaking Bad is acted and directed in exemplary fashion, his pitiful situation reflects a superlative in character development and provides an ample perspective to the resultant outlet of his intentions. The family of Walter, while being implied as implicitly innocent actually come into interaction with the dark side of Walter White often, this continuity and differentiation between clandestine and regular give not only Walter White two sides of a coin but also his lifestyle and the subsequently subversively progressive nature of the plot.

Breaking Bad holds true to the realism and philosophy of ethical and morale situations, while also making these situations entertaining in a perversely farcical manner. It's this often uncannily insinuative implication of life's misdemeanours that makes Breaking Bad such an unimpeachable, refreshing and original achievement.
