I just finished the series so now I'm waiting for season 4, but let me tell you Bryan Cranston is one hell of an actor, from playing an over-stressed and over-worked comedic father in Malcolm in the Middle, to a serious dramatic bad a** father and a Methamphetamine cooker. Not only is he phenomenal, but Aaron Paul definitely deserves an Emmy for season 3, I'll poop my pants if he doesn't win.

The main plot of the show is Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is a High School Chemistry teacher that is diagnosed with cancer. He and his family are already middle class and paying for Chemo-therapy is expensive, so he hooks up with a former student (Aaron Paul) and starts to cook Methamphetamine, and he can do it perfectly since he respects the chemistry. And from there it just gets better and better.

One thing I love about this show is not only the incredible acting and writing, but the character development. I don't think I've seen a show that focused this much on the dynamics of characters, which more shows should do. You'll see Bryan Cranston go from an average father and teacher to a stone cold bad a** in the blink of an eye. Also Aaron Paul in season 3 blew my mind, he is emotional, intense, and comedic all at once. This show deserves a perfect 10.
