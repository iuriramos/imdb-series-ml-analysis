I started watching the show with my wife, we almost finished season 1 in couple of days. I can't wait to go get the rest of all the other seasons. Bryan Cranston's (the main character) acting is Oscar material. I wonder why I haven't known about his previous works! I guess I am going to research him and get some of his old stuff. Aaron Paul (Jesse) was the perfect pick for this role, my wife and I fell in love with his character more and more after each episode. RJ Mitte (Walter Jr.) in my opinion is a super star. The kind of kid that you'd love to adopt. He's full full of love and compassion to his family. I do watch a lot of TV!!! And frankly this is the only one that I have enjoyed as much as the Sopranos! Buy it or rent it, I highly recommend it.
