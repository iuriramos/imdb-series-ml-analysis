The character development of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman is just amazing the love and hate relationship between the two could be a show in of its self (altgough I cant see spinoffs being good for the Breaking Bad series). The high school chemistry teacher going on a DEA ride along meets his ex student who is making Meth and decides to join in on the operation. The two acquire an RV to cook with Walts chemistry supplies. Walt is in it for famliy because of his lung cancer Jesse is well Jesse. Walt and Jesse shares some famously amusing quotes that if you don't know you need to! One complaint about the show is there are only 5 seasons that I have enjoyed a lot but tgen again its better to go out with a bang then sputring downward spiral of viewership like some hit shows such as the Office over stayed there time. All the characters come in to the show and make it worth watching and never disapoints. Better Call Saul is a spin off and is coming November im a little scared sure a reunion would be nice but Saul for a whole new TV show I don't know.
