This is the best show i ever saw! It is the most intense thing i have ever seen. I am always excited for the next episode. I am involved in the show in entirely. It is also completely original. Brian Cranston does a great job as Walter White and couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part. The same goes for Aaron Paul ( as Jesse Pinkman). All of the Acting choices are perfect. The writing is just phenomenal! As I said, it is very intense, and it will leave you white-knuckled the entire series. I was very disappointing when the series ended because it has come such a long way since the first episode. I've had an awesome journey , and I am very thankful for Vince Gilligan for being so creative.
