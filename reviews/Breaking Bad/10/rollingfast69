I started watching BB marathon three weeks ago. Just finished it today. They couldn't have picked a better cast for this show. Brian Craston puts on a performance of a lifetime. And I couldn't picture anyone else playing the part. Every episode will leave you begging to watch the next one. The sad thing is its over and I'm still wishing there was another season. This is the first review i've ever felt compelled to write. The best thing is the series finale will leave nothing to the imagination. 

For the foreseeable future my TV watching will be forever ruined due to the fact that I will compare every show I watch to BB.

RIP Breaking Bad.... and Hiesenberg 

Good Luck to all the cast Thank You Gilligan for creating my mind the 

"BEST SHOW EVER"

PS. Even Anthony Hopkins thinks it's the best acting he's EVER seen. And it only took him 2 weeks to watch 5 seasons....
