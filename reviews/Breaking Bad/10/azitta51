At the end of season 4 my heart was pounding. Watching Breaking Bad is probably the most physically animated I have ever been whilst watching a TV series (hands over my eyes, laughing, gasping and actually talking at the TV). I have watched many excellent TV programmes, but engaged with this one unlike any other.

With characters that felt so real I thought about them long after credits. It is perfectly paced, beautifully shot, scripted and totally unpredictable.

Breaking Bad is not something I would recommend to everyone, but then this is not a show for the masses. The events unfold with unease, shock and excitement, with intricate and fascinating characters, including dead-behind-the-eyes Gus, and hilarious sham lawyer Saul.

If you are interested in morality, the ambiguity of relationships, have a dark sense of humour, and love a detailed TV series such as The Sopranos and The Wire, I don't need to tell you anymore: Go and watch it. Right now.
