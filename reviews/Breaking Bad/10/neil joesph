I don't know what to say about this show.... there are not enough words in the English language to describe the amazing-ness of this television series! I didn't ever watch this show when it was on the air...because I didn't wanna buy into all the hype..... i was stuck on my usual shows like "Entourage"..."boardwalk empire"..."homeland"...etc.. and not taking anything away from those shows...i LOVE those series also....but something about Breaking Bad is just... different. This show hits a nerve.... it is entertainment from minute 1 to 60....the writers of the show are nothing short of genius! I'm currently not even finished season 4 yet..but I have been watching them all back to back since season 1....and it is literally the only thing i want to watch. Addiction to the show is an understatement. I'm telling you right now...if you have gone this long without seeing this show... do yourself a favor and buy season 1.... make sure u watch AT LEAST 3 episodes in a row.. (that's the usual number that I find it takes to get into a new show)...and I guarantee you...YOUR HOOKED! Like the meth in the show....the show is the addiction!

WATCCHHH ITTT!!!!
