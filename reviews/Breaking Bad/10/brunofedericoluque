Yeah for me The X-Files is the best show I've seen in my life but Breaking Bad is also awesome (yeah two different genres i know but in their genre this two are the best) As Walter White's drug lord status evolves this show does it too from zero to high hero (!!!) The guy evolves from cooking on a RV to his own lab i mean awesome!!!! No words just awesome and Pinkman is also awesome no wonder why this is in the Guinnes Book of Records as THE BEST SHOW IN TV IN HISTORY...

Honestly watch this show this worths a watch seriously Breaking Bad is the best of the best...

Watch it!!!!
