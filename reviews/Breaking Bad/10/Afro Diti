It is the best TV show ever. EVERYONE is going to find it awesome. You watch it and your mind goes crazy.

If you watch 4 seasons, you are still not very sure about some things.. whats the real relationship between the two main characters? Do they like each other, or not?Do they care, or is it all about the money?? They play with your mind all the time. And the last season clears everything you have been wondering.

As about the main character, Heisenberg, the words are not enough. During the seasons you see his character changing and you can actually see his face changing.. What an amazing actor!

Every and each one of the characters is amazing. And thats the main reason why the show is so great.. You love love love them all! Even the ones you hate..
