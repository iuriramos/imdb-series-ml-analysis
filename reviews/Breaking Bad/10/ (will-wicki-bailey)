Breaking Bad is the only piece of watchable media to truly change my opinion on how to critique film and television. it is not only the best written, edited, and directed show, but takes those components to a level of excellence which I thought impossible by the television industry. The acting lead Bryan Cranston is not only worthy of any Emmy or Golden Globe, But of Oscar winning standard. The shows brilliance is also made visually, with beautiful cinematography, colour palette and camera angles. But where Breaking Bad really excels is its characters. How they react, change and deal with problems. this is done in a way only dreamed, let alone performed by any other show-runner and TV writer.

But when i try to recommend Breaking Bad to someone in a way that it is a critical masterpiece, people become hesitant. That is where Breaking Bad is special, it works for both a critics and viewers.

How the almost Comedic sounding "the story of Walter White a high school Chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin" turned into this; i do not know. all i know is that this seemingly innocent 5 season crime drama, has raised the bar for television and has changed the game on every level...
