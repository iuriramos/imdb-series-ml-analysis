Breaking Bad is by far the best show ever created, The writing is just brilliant, the acting just fantastic with such a huge sense of realism. The show would not be at all the same with out it's amazing writer Vince Gilligan, and it's extremely talented actors/actresses especially Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, and Dean Norris. You just get sucked into the show and can't stop watching, the show just he's more and more action packed every single episode building up to the shocking final season.

Everything about the show is perfect, it's sad to see the show is over and to know there will never be anything else on television up to the extremely high standards of Breaking Bad.
