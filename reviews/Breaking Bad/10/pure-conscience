This show is a gem. Pure and simple. Sure, if you look hard enough into anything you will find imperfections, and there will always be those with descending opinions (if, often, only for the sake of being so), but you will simply not find much ever made as well or as interesting as this show or nearly as addictive. Once I started watching it I couldn't stop. Who would have thought a show (ostensibly) about an addictive drug was as or more addictive than I can imagine any drug could ever be? The story line(s), the characters, the direction, the pace, the writing, are all among the best I have ever seen and impossible not to be vested in. Obviously it's pretty dark and be ready for a lot of disturbing events, though. However how could something lighter ever be this good? Albeit there are light moments that made me laugh as much as anything I have seen. If television has ever produced a ten, this is it.
