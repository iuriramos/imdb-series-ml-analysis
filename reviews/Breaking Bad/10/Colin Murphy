It was only last year that Ireland received this show on TV, pretty sad huh? Seeing as how long it's been out.

As somebody who doesn't watch TV, I seen the season box-sets in my local DVD store a few times, I always looked at the cases, read the synopsis but never purchased. I was sketchy I guess because I thought with Bryan Cranston (Being Hal from Malcolm in the Middle) that the show wouldn't have been as "hardcore" as it is/was stated to be.

One day after being in my DVD store, I finally decided to purchase Season 1, not thinking much of it I went home and turned it on. Let's just say, I sat there for 7-8 hours, the day flew by.

My thoughts were wrong, I was wrong, what I thought it would have been was/is not, it is superior, far more superior than any of your typical shows like "Weeds" (Which yes I know is a comedy so there really is no solid comparison) or programs like The Wire. Breaking Bad delivers what it says it does, and I'm pretty sure either Bryan Cranston is either getting paid billions to perform in this,or he really is a methamphetamine manufacturer because his acting is ABSOLUTELY brilliant in this show. It's quite possibly the best acting I've ever seen in a TV show seeing how he went from an image of "Hal" to an image of "Walter", this bad-ass dad who takes **** from nobody.

Jesse & Walter are quite the pair, Aaron & Bryan are quite the pair, on camera and off camera. Watching the blooper reels I can see they have a laugh and a good time. On the set they have a good time doing what they do, and I cannot even begin to describe how attached to this show they are, I sometimes even believe it's a documentary of some sort, a real life happening.

I am just now going on to Season 3, I look do not regret any minute I've spent watching this show and I extremely recommend it for anybody out there, this is a solid 10/10.

Remember folks, "Stay out of his territory".
