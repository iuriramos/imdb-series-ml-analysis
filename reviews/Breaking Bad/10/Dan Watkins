I've been a huge fan of Breaking Bad since I first started seeing the ads for season 1. I've told everyone I know about how great this show is. I've gotten my wife and all of her friends hooked on it, and we religiously watch every episode.

Breaking Bad hooks the viewer immediately with it's lets get down to business approach. This show is a unique, candid portrayal of shocking realism. Each individual character in Breaking Bad is unforgettable, and as real as can be. No fluff. The unstable balance between Walt's criminal endeavors and his middle-class teacher profile is brilliant. The excitement over all of the characters coming within a millimeter of exposing Walt and the threat of the ball of yarn coming unraveled at any time is thrillingly unnerving.

I can't wait to see what season 4 brings, and how all of the pieces of the puzzle will come together. Breaking Bad has all the elements of a timeless drama. Well thought out, and well executed.
