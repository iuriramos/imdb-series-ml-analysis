You gotta take your laptop with your booming headphones and sit down for hours cuz all that what happens in there won't let you move your head even an inch. A perfect blend of picturization,story,thrill all together with a set of excellent characters bringing out "THE BEST" compilation of crime drama ever seen!! The best part is the sequence of the story, you can never predict what's next and its always the beginning of the episode giving the thrill. You can't skip this series if you are a thriller freak. Excellent work!! Hope it would have continued forever!! Hats off for Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul for their work and to all crew members!!
