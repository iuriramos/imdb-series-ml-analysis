BREAKING BAD is clearly one of the top rated shows on TV, with high viewership ratings, widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and a dedicated fan base like no other show has, but even so, it is one of the most underrated series of all-time. Calling this "the greatest show on Earth" is an understatement. Now often cast into obscurity by other big shows, i.e. The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad receives a lack of the credit it deserves. Its exceptional acting is almost exceeded by its equally great writing. The actors, writer(s), and directors were almost overqualified, and thus the series was nearly too good. Its surely too good to be true. Its blend of drama, action, comedy, and suspense makes for great, thrilling entertainment. The series, which revolves around a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and teams up with an underachieving ex-student to manufacture crystal methamphetamine to secure his family's future when he's gone, was expertly written and expertly shot, and is more than deserving of mere critical acclaim. Breaking Bad is the greatest show on Earth (understatement.)
