Breaking Bad is simply brilliant, there is no other way to describe this show. It is the best acted show currently on TV and maybe all-time. There are not enough words to describe Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White. His 3 emmy's speak for itself. Just like Vic Mackey on The Shield, the protagonist is becoming the antagonist but you continue to root for the guy. Aaron Paul has been unbelievable as his side kick Jesse and in my opinion gave a better performance during the ground breaking 3rd season. The concept and plot may initially turn you off but if you enjoyed The Wire, Sopranos, Mad Men, or The Shield then I guarantee you will enjoy this show. It may not be at The Wire and The Soprano's level yet, but one more season of greatness will put it right in the pantheon of dramas.
