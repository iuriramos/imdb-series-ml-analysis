10/10 TV-Series, it's absolutely great. The acting is AWESOME! Especially by Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston. The other actors do a good job too, but the duo is the main deal here and the most important characters of course. 

First when i tried this show out back in spring of 2014, i could not get into it. I tried watching it but i got bored and stuff, because i kind of have A.D.D . But now i just gave it a shot not long ago, and WOAH! It's a GREAT TV Show! Straight up there in my book with the other awesome ones. I have to give it a 10/10 rating because it is just PERFECTION.

Thrilling TV Series, with 5 seasons full of goodies. I've heard, and I mostly agree that, season by season, the show just keeps on getting better until.... it's OVER.
