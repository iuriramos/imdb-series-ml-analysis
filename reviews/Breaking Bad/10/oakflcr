One of the best shows I have seen on TV, original plot and excellent writing, is as real as it gets in the fantasy TV world, of course in real life some of this characters would die faster like Jessie because in real life there is no job contracts or ratings do not take matter if a character gets killed but as far as TV is as close to reality as it is going to get. I think is easier to believe shows based on fiction or fantasy like Game of thrones because a person can ignore realities and the range for the imagination is wider and anything goes, however in shows that imitate reality is much harder to write because the writers have limits and like I said before you cannot kill a character because that particular character could affect the rating of the show. In reality Walter White seems very real, the only thing that I find to believe is that someone as smart as him would put his life and family in danger for a low life junkie like Jessie in a real situation in the drug world we would have not lasted very long no matter how cool he is. No matter the variety of interesting characters makes it awesome.
