I have never seen such violent scenes in Sunday evening shows. How prisoners were stabbing their preys, it was really awful to look at this scene. Any sane being would be shocked by these scenes.

I agree, that it is quite stunning, what W.W. has become. It's same, as in real life with people - when you tell yourself every new day, that this one is the last time, that you will just do this last job and you'll quit, but more money make people even more mentally unstable and all this turns into a sick game with no end and meaning.

Breaking Bad gives you that authentic feel of what goes through minds of people like Gustavo 'Gus' Fring and Walt White, people, who play their and others lives, like they're playing friendly chess at home. Without showing any single emotion, they just moving figures on a board, not realizing anymore, what is real and that those figures are not made of wood anymore.

When you watch this show, you feel, like you are the chessmaster, watching your favorite game, world championship on TV and you understand, why players doing this or that move. While game continues, you fully agree with all the moves, but at the end, you starting to criticize their actions, thinking, that you would do everything different, but as new episode starts, you forgetting all your criticism and getting fascinated by players performance.

Actors play is on a very high level. Yes, it has some "over the top" moments, but you really don't care, because most of the time, their play is impressive and it makes you feel for them.

What is great about Breaking Bad, is that after episode ends, you all like "what a bunch of a**holes! How could they do that?! Mentals.." But, you know, why you're watching this show - because it's kickas* and this is the show for a real man - drugs, money, power and life, like a chess game. ..and in overall, you love it!

Thank you, Breaking Bad crew, for releasing such masterpiece.

And remember, my dear friends - drugs are BAD. All, that you see in this show, is about, what people should NOT do and at the end of the series, I hope, everyone will learn their lesson, that doing dirty money is BAD, Breaking Bad.
