I never thought that there will be a show (or a movie) deserving only superlatives when spoken (or written) of.

Words simply can't describe this series.

The writing, the acting, every little bit and piece - simply WOW!

Watch it, and get blasted away by this genius piece of art.

The only problem with BB is that after watching it all other series simply are no fun to watch.

I do think, that this is the highest point where a TV series could get, and doubt that it'll be changed any time soon.

I'll leave it at that, no need for spoiling.
