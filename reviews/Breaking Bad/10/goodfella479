So I haven't seen shows like The Sopranos or MASH or others that are highly rated. But I have seen a lot, and out of what I have seen this show takes the cake, and by a lot. Nearly every aspect of episode, from the story to the acting to the sound and then directing and cinematography are top notch. I personally can't re-watch a TV series without getting bored really quick (2 episodes into Lost I was done), but I've seen this series 4 times already and am excited for just about every episode (peek a boo kills me, I skip through a lot of that episode) and will do so again when I have the final episodes in hand.

I think that if you have any excuse at all to start a series from scratch, this is the one for you.
