First, I'd like to say this drama is one of the best I have seen recently. Part of the reason why this drama is so good is because it has challenged the conventional view of morality. Nobody is really "good" or "selfless" in this drama. What motivates them is always the instinct to survive and to live better, which seems realistic to me.

What I don't understand is why some people are shocked or angry that Walt has turned more and more "evil" throughout the drama. He started season 1 as a meth cook, which is already considered a "illegal" job by the society. In my opinion, whatever happened during later seasons just flowed naturally from this decision, whether it's killing, poisoning, fighting the gangs or deceiving his family. I mean once you enter the underworld, that's what will happen, otherwise you can't survive. 

So if one accepted or even partly agreed with Walt's decision to be a meth cook in season 1, I don't see the reason why they wouldn't be able to accept what happened later. I think that's also one of the reasons why this show is so good, it really forces people to reflect on their own view of morality.
