This TV show was the very first thing to get me seriously interested in cinematic glory. It's perfect script, amazing acting, and stellar cinematography leave me knowing that without a doubt this show will be remembered through history. Every episode leaves you thirsty for more and willing to choke someone with a bike lock to get it. With each season the epic tale of walter white gets increasingly better. I applaud every single person who worked on this show and I hope it's spin off can bring me as much love as breakingbad did.

The story gives you a dramatic look into the life of a dying man, who knows that very soon he will die, leaving nothing to his family. This drives him to become the greatest drug dealer that ever lived and his greed leads to the very fall of his empire, and it is shown to you in such elegance that I can help but believe it to be the greatest piece of cinematic glory to come to your TV.
