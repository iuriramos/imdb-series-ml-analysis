Breaking Bad has always been my favorite TV series but I never felt like writing a review about it or something, since many many people already said before me just what I wanted to say: it's without a doubt, the best TV series ever. That's something only a person who has followed plenty of TV shows in his own life could say, and I am that kind of person. I've seen The Sopranos, Dexter, The Walking Dead, Game Of Thrones, Twin Peaks and many other arguably defined "best TV shows ever", and Breaking Bad is definitely the best among them. The only one that's only SLIGHTLY inferior is HBO's best, Six Feet Under. Sure, I still have to try out shows like Mad Men and The Wire, but I doubt they could even go close to this AMC masterpiece. Breaking Bad is a perfect mix, since it has comedy, tragedy, action, horror and cop stuff, and no movie or show has ever integrated so many different genres in such a perfect way. Everything about it is excellent: the soundtrack, the directing, the montage, the metaphors, the little details, the acting, the writing, the twists... I never could describe it with words without missing important features it has, because it's a complete show, maybe the only one ever. 10/10
