well where do i begin , this show is not just another television show its the most awesome thing a person could ever encounter . its fiction everyone knows that but still its like the most real thing i've ever seen. the acting , the story , the direction , the dialogs ,everything is out of this world . And at top of all these things Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul had portrayed there characters fantastically . i mean i can't imagine anyone else to act the way these two did. Its the thing that is gonna be remembered for centuries. i don't know about any of you people but this show has made a major impact in my life .And for those who like watching TV series haven't seen this one are missing the best experience of TV.
