Since the first episode I started to watch, I couldn't stop. Breaking Bad name is given very correctly to the movie... It takes you from basics of life to somewhere you don't or can't imagine that yourself could be there.. decisions of 'being bad' based on what? Answer is here.. It can be you your friend or whoever.. Just check it out.. Reality, comedy, heavy drama everything is together.. It is a dark movie.. I enjoyed watching it.. I strongly recommend.. All players deserves high credits.. Excellent work... I am surprised why it is not that famous world wide or it hasn't reach high viewer ratings like house m.d. or lost.. however even if you haven't watch, I am sure you'll here the movies name a lot in the near future..
