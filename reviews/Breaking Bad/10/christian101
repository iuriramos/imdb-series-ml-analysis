I remember the night I started watching this work of art. I had noticed it was mentioned on Conan one night and I decided to finally check out the AMC show. Netflix had, at the time, the first three or four seasons on it (yes, I came in late). I watched the first episode and right when I saw those pants fall to the ground, I was amazed. I was able to see the final season live on television and I remember tearing up at the very end of the very last scene of the very last episode. I instantly went online and bought the box set. Breaking Bad has a very original style that includes fantastic directing and writing, beautiful cinematography, the best acting I have ever seen in a television serial, and amazing editing and music. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are by far two of the greatest actors of the early 2000s. The usage of flashbacks, allusions, foreshadowing, and cliffhangers create the feeling in the viewer to continue watching until the last second. ...then re-watch the show. I have seen every episode three times, at least. I am still noticing new things that connect everything together, making it feel like I am watching the show for the first time again. When Better Call Saul, the show's prequel, had begun airing, I was excited to finally have some more Gilligan-esque episodes. The Breaking Bad world is incredible since it was all written by an amazing team.
