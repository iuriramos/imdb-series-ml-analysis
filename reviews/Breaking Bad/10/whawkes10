I was first introduced to Breaking Bad through my friend. I thought," Bryan Cranston doing a serious role? He will fail." I was a big Malcolm in the middle fan and was used to him being the stupid father. I was wrong. He did excellent in his role of Walter White. And the rest of the cast is perfect. It has deep characters that you get invested into, and moments that just make you go," did that just happen?" It will always keep you guessing. This is why it is the best show ever. Aaron Paul was pretty much what you would imagine a drug dealing failure of a student to be. This show is also very realistic. You finish an episode, go outside and think to yourself," and this really happens?" If you decide to watch this show. Say good bye to your social life.
