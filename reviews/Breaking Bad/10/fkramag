I won't go deep in the review, since it would take me hours to explain why this show is great. From the action to character development. We see Walter, a high school chemistry teacher fighting with low life standards and lung cancer, turning to a major drug lord who cares only about his ways. Then you have Jessie who actually developed into a good and loyal character, he did bad things and illegal things, but he turned his life over and created something from his previous junkie life.

Watching the show made me wonder why I didn't pay more attention at my chemistry classes. In the end this show is worth watching and will actually motivate you if you are struggling in your life, however just don't break bad.
