this is best TV show series movie I ever seen now 30 years old and there a lot of good ones... but this one goes much much further it goes couple levels higher than best movies ever like godfather... or Scarface and pulp fiction and it makes it even more awesome because it is a series so it has much more depth... its just perfect...

it has little things in it in which mostly you can see only in TV movies... it has some great effects of an action movie it has humor on it it has CHANGE you can really feel the change and the characters... the story the mystery and all main characters even smaller roles play excellent and have an own influence and most important of all.. it is the play between character... that it goes for all of them...

its true that it has some similarity's with the weeds... in story... but the whole directing the whole tone is set totally different... that I cannot compare it... with as far as I know there are none or few series like this and that makes it even more awesome some people try to compare it with prison break... mad man and dexter but it has nothing in common not even the level breaking bad is far beyond those the only one which could come close is Oz from tom Fontana only those 2 has such depth that it comes close to reality and still every actor seems to be in main role ....
