This is the best show i've ever seen and I don't think I will ever watch something this good on television again.

The cast is absolutely outstanding, not a single weak performance,they were all perfect: Bryan Cranston gives one of the best performances of all time and the same thing goes for Aaron Paul. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, with the best performances coming from Anna Gunn, Giancarlo Esposito, Jonathan Banks, Dean Norris, Bob Odenkirk... hell even Jesse Plemons.

Walter is (and by far) the best character of TV history and his evolution an relationship with Jesse are two most interesting and addictive things ever. There's not a lot of comedy but when the show wants to be funny is HILARIOUS.

The directing is stunning; every episode is a visual masterpiece and some directors (not only from TV) could learn something out of this).

The original soundtrack is beautiful and incredibly intense (Crawl Space) and the non original songs made this one of my favorite soundtracks of all time.

Each season is better than the last one, look my at 10/10 rating for the episodes on each season:

.S1: Pilot .S2: Phoenix, ABQ .S3: Fly, Half Measures, Full Measure S4.: Crawl Space, End Times, Face Off S5: Live Free or Die, Say My Name, Confessions, Ozymandias, Granite State, Felina

Perfect writing, perfect acting, perfect direction and soundtrack... go watch the show.
