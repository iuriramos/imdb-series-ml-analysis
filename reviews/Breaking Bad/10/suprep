I am a person who loves good movies and series and sees them as piece of art. However, I have never encountered a series which comes this close to perfection as Breaking Bad does. I have been watching it since the very beginning and unlike any other series I have watched, Breaking Bad keeps getting better. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are both absolutely terrific and have probably given the best performances of their lives. I could go on for hours and explain why Breaking Bad is simply the best series ever created but most of it has already been said and words can not describe the experience I made with it. This is my very first review on IMDb and I am not sure if I will ever write another one. I am writing this to express my love for this series and to thank everyone involved in creating this piece of art.

10/10 Masterpiece...
