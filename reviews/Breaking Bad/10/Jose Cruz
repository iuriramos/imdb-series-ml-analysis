First I should say that I have watched the first four seasons and the first 5 episodes of the fifth season of the show. So I have pretty much watched nearly 90% of this TV series for now, so my review should be fairly representative of the overall quality of this TV series.

So, this is it people, the ultimate TV series. I never was more entertained for longer amounts of time than this TV series. It is indeed a unique TV series, delivering higher quality drama than 99% of the films in the cinemas and at larger doses. It represents the culmination of modern cable TV and shows indeed, that writers of TV shows are becoming more creative than the Hollywood film makers, who appear to lack any real ideas.

A TV series for those that like TV, but not for children: this is a quite graphic, violent and strong piece of audio visual entertainment.
