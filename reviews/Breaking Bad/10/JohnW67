Well, i started to watch Breaking Bad very late so i had to hurry to catch up with AMC schedules.

Knowing that, and needing to hurry, i watched like the 3 first seasons in 2 weeks, with several episodes a day.

I found first season pretty boring, because of the lack of violence and major events. But, let's face it, screenwriters & creator had to take time to set a solid background for the show. In this season, you barely only learn about Hank's (main character) family & Jesse's (Supporting role) past more than 'how to really cook good meths ?'.

For the second season, the show offers lot more, especially in violence, verbal and physic and some nice drug dealing.

Then, after watching season number 2, i personally had huge expectations, wondering if Hank & Jesse would finally grow and become the most famous drug dealers. And so did they !

They meet their boss, Gustavo (probably the best character in that show, in my opinion) and become more and more bad, starting killing people, even though they had a rule against that. 3rd and 4th seasons will grab your guts and make you want for more.

I won't say anything further, just advice people who might read this comment to watch Breaking Bad and they won't regret it.

10/10.
