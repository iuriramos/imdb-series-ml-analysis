This is obvious one of the best written, acted and directed TV shows i've seen in the last years! With Bryan Cranston playing on the one hand side a good, gentle, warm house father and on the other hand a genius and by sometimes wacko drug-lord, which makes it a really exciting and addictive story!

I've watched the last episode some weeks ago, and the first days after it was like I was missing something, and even though there are a lot of good TV shows, this one tips it all. From the first episode off till the last it takes you by the arm and takes you on a roller-coaster trip true meth land! 

But there are some points you have to know, the first season takes off pretty slow, with a briefly good introduction from all characters and who they really are. Until the point Walter discovers his decease and meets up with his former student Jesse, which you can see as a good kid in the wrong business. From that moment the vibe has been set and the ride is getting on slowly. 

My conclusion is, that this is probably the best TV show of this century. With a lot of great acting, a lot of superb one liners, and a never to forget character: Heisenberg!
