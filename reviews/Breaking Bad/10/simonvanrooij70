The Finale of this series has been almost 2 years ago. Still today are people writing reviews about this show. They still love it, they can't let go. Just like me. Wish I could experience it all over again... and again. Better Call Saul has got a slow start. Some characters from BB appear in sidelines. But I'm afraid that the expectations are very high. Better call Saul is not about BB. It's a totally different series. Of course people are watching and hoping to get that BB high back. BB is like the love that broke your heart. You will always remember how good the feeling was, but you will never experience it again.

BB is a hero story. A 50 year old man facing total defeat, transforms himself into a winner. That in itself, brings a message of hope to a lot of people. The possibility of turning your life completely around, and doing what needs to be done. Totally transcending morality and mortality. The way this story captures your mind and soul, is beyond any other TV series.

Breaking Bad is the best TV series ever. Hands down.

Wrote the above today, just found out that season 6 is coming!!! I am stunned! Just clicked the spoiler alert for the lines below.

Walt didn't die! Season six begins with Walt waking up in the hospital, handcuffed to his bed. He's going to trial and will be incarcerated. He will be a high profile prisoner but not for long, I guess... He will use his chemists skills to breakout and start a killing spree, likes there's no tomorrow. The blue meth business will be revived and he once again will be the king of meth. I don't hope that he is still so family oriented. Why not surround himself with good looking golddiggers?! Be a real criminal kingpin! The shooting starts in July 2015 and I hope the premiere date will be in January. I Hope.
