-I used to prefer Dexter, but the last seasons just sucked and made the show to be not perfect like Breaking Bad is. Breaking Bad's seasons are all good ones and it gets better and better and better and better and better. The cast is perfect. Just pick the perfect actors for the roles. Bryan Cranston it's the shoulder of all the show. He brings the tension, comedy and drama that makes Breaking Bad what it is. Walter White A.K.A Heisenberg is my favorite character of the show and maybe history of television. But it's not just Bryan also the other shoulder, Aaron Paul. The chemistry between them it's perfect like all in this show. Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Giancarlo Esposito, Jonathan Banks, just everybody in the show is perfect for the roles they play. Still thinking why Mad Men won over Breaking Bad 2 consecutive years for Drama Series. I mean Mad Men is good but far far far far far away from Breaking Bad. Now that have won 2 Golden Globes, I cannot wait for more awards. Specially the Emmys,yeah I think it will win all the Emmys in each Category. Bryan Cranston for Lead Actor, Aaron Paul for Supporting Actor, Anna Gunn for Supporting Actress, Drama Series and maybe Directing and Writing for its best episode 'Ozymandias' 5x14. Just love the Show and hope Bryan won his last Emmy in August. Perfect ending by the way, Bitch!
