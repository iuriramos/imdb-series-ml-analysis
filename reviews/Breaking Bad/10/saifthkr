I got to know about the show through my friend but it sounded pretty much alright! I mean a professor who cooks meth doesn't sound all that awesome, but once I got through the first season, OMG! it just got me hooked up to it. The casting is excellent and there is justice done to each and every character in this show. The transformation of Walter White to Heseingberg is totally worth a watch. Apart from that the supporting characters of Jesse Pinkman, Skyler, Hank and Saul Goodman are excellently developed. I have got know that a show on Saul Goodman has been released and I just cannot wait to watch that thing after an amazing Breaking Bad experience. It definitely is one of the best TV shows till date!
