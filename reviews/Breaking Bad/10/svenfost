I just saw episode 3x10 and have only one thing to say: Whuawahua! It's just the best fiction I've seen for years. In France we call cinema the 7th art, in the US it's the industry of entertainment. In most cases, I prefer the American way of saying it. But for this episode, I'm on the French sideÂ… Imagine the pitch: let's put two guys and a fly in a cave for 50 minutes. Who's crazy enough to accept such a scenario? The actors are so real, so sensitive, so violent and so fragile; I just fell in love with both. I leave next door to Godard, in Switzerland and I'm sure he'd like this challenge: no sex, no violence, no incredible camera effect, no make-up and no tricky scenario: just two guys in a cave with a fly. Only those incredible actors could have made it so tense and beautiful. Please go on!
