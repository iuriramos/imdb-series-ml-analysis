Simply put Breaking Bad is the finest piece of television I've ever seen. It is the golden standard to which all shows should be compared, it is the ideal to strive for. Some may not like the plot, and story, put no one can deny Breaking Bad's excellence. Breaking Bad uses everything possible to make it the masterpiece it is. From its excellent, diverse and meaningful use of music, to its beautiful uses of shadowing, lighting and color for storytelling purposes, its A+ acting across the board, its hidden foreshadowing and symbolism and its fantastic direction and writing. Breaking Bad improves with age, like a fine wine, and it starts and end every single one of its explosive with divers and powerful style. Breaking Bad has a meticulous attention to detail that very few other shows, or films have. Like anything it may have its flaws, but these few flaws cannot take away anything from what it has achieved ... a show as close to flawless as there'll ever be.
