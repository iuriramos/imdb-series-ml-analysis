It's great. It's what people have always wanted from crime drama; it's about pride, desperation, decision, obsession, escalation, and the toll on relationship--including relationship with one's self--that ensues.

The writing is great. On rare, rare occasions there might be a shadow of a false note; either an "off" usage, or a foray into character exploration that seems a little ill-considered. But even these add genuine color to the product. Think of them as a blue tinge to a very pure artistic product.

The production values are great, and all personnel deliver, from top to bottom. As I write they're rolling out the final half of season 5; just saw episode 10, and it utterly rips your heart out.

Breaking Bad will go down as classic television; amongst the best ever.
