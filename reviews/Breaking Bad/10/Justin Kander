Breaking Bad is my favorite show of all time. I am glad that I'm not alone in this belief, and it is one of the greatest misfortunes that people out there either have not seen or do not appreciate this show.

People often compare Breaking Bad to Weeds, because it is about a parental unit resorting to selling drugs in order to provide for his family. Except that Breaking Bad is actually realistic, truly dramatic, and doesn't start grasping at straws by the time the second season ends. The best part about the show is how organically it progresses. With other shows, transitions can seem forced, but with Breaking Bad, the entire series feels like one long season. Things that happen in Season 1 actually have meaning in Season 4. 

It's also just incredible how engaging the series is. Everyone acts so well, and the storyline is so rich and layered you get blown away multiple times an episode. You really gotta hand it to Bryan Cranston. If you had told me ten years ago that the Dad from Malcolm in the Middle would be performing superbly as a meth dealer, I would've laughed in your face. By the end of the first episode of Breaking Bad, I already associated Cranston more with Walter than Hal.

Watch this show, you will not be disappointed. It's as deep and rewarding as any show can get. It's also amazing such gold would turn up on AMC rather than a premium cable network. Nothing HBO has ever produced can get close to Breaking Bad, as good as those shows are.
