if uve seen some and you like the general style then id say you are in for a special period in your life.

when someone asked me what it is (really unknown in Europe at the moment), i said it's a bit of a genre of it's own, being a mix of suspense (The Unit type of thrill), and black comedy within tragedy; i.e. it has serious stuff in it as well / is thought-provoking.

i really hope they will keep it up for the 4th season.

p.s. id skip episode 4 of the first season though, and maybe the 3rd too, i don't remember about the third.

p.p.s. many will disagree, but i think it's on par with The Wire, if not better :)
