There are very few TV shows that I get so engrossed in that I can't stop watching it. Breaking Bad is one of them

Never before have I watched a series that is done as well as this one. It has unexpected plot twists and unforeseen events that you could never guess. Very rarely is a TV show so brilliant and done so well. I would strongly recommend watching Breaking Bad!! It is a perfect, and I mean perfect blend of action and drama that will make you get addicted to it like nothing else. It has clif hangers that will leave you so speechless the only thing you will be able to do is watch the next episode. If you haven't started watching Breaking Bad yet, you should, you have no idea what you're missing.
