Breaking Bad has two significant problems: first, it makes everything else on TV look pale or silly in comparison; second, it's only on TV once a week (and only for a few months a year).

Simply put, Breaking Bad is the best serialized drama in the history of television. There is nothing to fault. The acting, the characterizations, the plots, everything is absolutely top-notch. And each week ends with a cliff-hanger that makes you wish it were next week already so you can see the next episode. I didn't know a show could be so effective for so long. Season 1 is incredible; season 2 is at least as good; and season 3 is the best season of any show ever made. Now that season 3 is over, life will not be quite right until season 4 begins. The good news: there WILL be a season 4. The bad news: it won't begin until July 2011.

If you haven't seen this series, buy or rent the discs and watch it in order. But don't go too fast or you'll run out of episodes before season 4 starts.
