What is there to say? It's Breaking Bad.

I could go on at length about it, but there's not much left to be said that others haven't said before. The writing is great, the acting is as well. It's easy to get lost in the story, and even the episodes that seem a little lacking compared to some of the others in the series are still very good. 

Looking at the long list of Golden Globes, Emmys, and other awards that Breaking Bad has received makes it clear I'm not alone in this opinion. It would be an achievement to continue a coherent story like this just for a single episode, but to do it over the entire series as you watch Walter's transformation from a science teacher to a killer and drug lord is nothing short of amazing.
