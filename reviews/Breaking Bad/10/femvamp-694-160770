Evil isn't a light switch, it's a journey and it's a journey that Walter White has been on since the story began. Walter White could have gone far in life as a scientist but instead he took the easy path and became a lowly high school science teacher with a disabled son and another child on the way. Then he discovers he is dying from lung cancer. What is a man to do? Well this man starts to manufacture meth as a way to cushion his family for when he is gone. This show is very dark and yet very well written. There is not a needless character in the story. From the brother-in-law DEA agent to the wily lawyer, from the increasingly suspicious wife to the Ne'er-do-well business partner, Everyone has a purpose. In essence you are watching something truly beautiful. A good man breaking bad.....and taking everyone else down with him.
