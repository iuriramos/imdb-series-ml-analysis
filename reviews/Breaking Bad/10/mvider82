Even though I don't write reviews very often, I will do this for this one. BB is one of the best TV shows in the last 10 years for sure. Brilliant storyline, unexpected twists, great acting and a great ending (unlike Dexter).

Lot of people talk about great actors who played Walt and Pinkmann, but my other favorites was the sleazy lawyer (brilliantly cast) and Skylar, Walts wife!

I think why this series is so great is that no character is black or white. They are very much on the gray scale- all characters have flaws and everyone can relate/understand them to a degree.

Of course Walts choice to start making drugs is questionable to many. But I think most people can relate to mid life crisis, desperation, self fulfillment and love for the family. We all make bad choices sometimes, but thankfully not as bad as Walt.

One thing I take with me after BB, is that even though we all have choices in life, we never really know where they are going to take us...
