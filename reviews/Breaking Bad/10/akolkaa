Here come the waves of depression as I realize there will never be another new episode of Breaking Bad. I still miss that TV show. I do really love this story so much. Vince Gilligan is a genius. Thank you for such a brilliant TV show. No one could ever show it like you did. I can't forget and stop thinking about it. When I've re-watched some of the interviews, it's made me sad and I actually started to cry. 

Cast of Breaking Bad is the best cast ever existed! Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt and the others. I miss your acting, your talent. It will change the way you think. And I just thought that I need to write a review for the best show on TV. 

That's all.
