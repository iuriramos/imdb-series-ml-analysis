This series is the best i've ever seen. I watched many series like walking dead,game of thrones,sopranos,the wire but Breaking Bad is the Number one.

The funny thing about Breaking Bad is that when you urge people to watch it, and describe the basic idea of the show, they think it all sounds a bit ridiculous. Well, hands up, so did we when it was explained to us. To anyone out there who has these doubts - put them from your mind! This is, without doubt one of the finest pieces of drama ever made. There is not a weak performance from any of the actors, and the consistent quality of the storyline is maintained through all 5 series. I would go as far as to say that Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White (mild-mannered chemistry teacher gone bad) is bordering on genius.

The first and second season was a kind of boring(in action), but there are so many good conversations. And the actors are so good. I really loved the show and i was really surprised at the end. Watch out for spoilers in the internet, there many dump people..
