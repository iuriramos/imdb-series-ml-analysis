Breaking Bad is easily one of the best shows on TV. With jaw- breaking screenplay and a perfect cast, Vince Gilligan steals the show.

In the pilot itself, breaking bad tells us that it's not just another show, but much more. Walter White, a chemistry teacher, learns that he has cancer and won't live long. So he teams up with Jesse Pinkman, one of his students to make and sell meth (an illegal drug) to make more money in order to secure his family's future. His brother-in-law is a DEA agent, so he uses an alias 'Heisenberg' in his drug dealings. A series of events and experiences in his latter life transforms him from the poor Walter White that he is, to a harder and bad-ass character of Heisenberg. In fact the change happens so slowly that we won't even notice it. After watching Season 5, if you watch Season 1 again, you'd feel that Walter White has two personalities. Also it delivers the perfect finale that we could hope for.

If you haven't seen it yet, then get over it already. If you have, then you already know that watching it again and again ain't so bad after all.

Vince Gilligan, I Salute You!!!
