John Wayne once said that the hallmark of a good actor is for the audience to watch an actor and not feel that they are actually acting. The screenplay/writing was beyond clever. It was brilliant. And the top notch acting combined by all the actors made this probably the best series I have ever watched over the last 22 years with the exception of the mini series Lonesome Dove which I would call a draw. Better than Alias, better than Dexter...both of which captivated me completely. Let me just put this into perspective. One of the greatest actors of our generation, Anthony Hopkins sat down, just as I did and did a marathon viewing of the show and praised not only Bryan Cranston (as one of the greatest actors he has seen) but the whole cast as one greatest acting ensembles ever gathered. I can't believe this came out of AMC. 

They say that there are no new ideas, that everything has already been done once or twice. No, this wasn't the same old tired series, it wasn't a recycled good show. It proves that creativity hasn't died and that repeats and remakes are no longer completely necessary laziness. It showed that fresh creativity still exists. This show sucked me in to the characters, good or bad and made me sympathize with each of them. It made me feel like a hero and a low life criminal, a victim, a cop, it made me look at each side of me and blurred the lines between right and wrong. There was no black or white. Only shades of Grey and a narrative of the main character and others going from white to dark Grey and descending into total hell . Enough to conflict my soul for a long long time. Total excellence. :)
