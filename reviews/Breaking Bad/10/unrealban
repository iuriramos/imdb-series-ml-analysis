To all you independent filmmakers out there:

Take a look how this show is filmed. It is so simple yet gripping. There are no moving camera shots for the most part and the camera is always on a steady cam. No dollies involved and they use simple angles and very few close ups. 

Shows like this inspire me to thinking that I can actually make something similar. As far as the writing, it is top notch and very layered. The writers pay off all their plot devices and set up them equally as good. I also like how they dwell on certain scenes for 4-5 minutes at a time. It creates a certain realism that emulates real life. As far as the content, it is captivating in a sick way, similar to Pulp Fiction and other black crime comedies. 

My favorite part about this show is Aaron Paul and his madness. The show truly captures the up and down spiral of dealing drugs or doing them. There will always be downfalls and people going to jail or dying around you. One minute you have thousands, then the next you're left broke and have nothing. Some of the best moments are when Walter and AP are frantically disposing or moving drug money/paraphernalia. I love how they always hide sixty grand under the kitchen sink or in their vents. 

A must see and definitely one of the best shows of the last decade.
