This was like a well written novel, not TV. The tragic story of Walter white was a breathtaking journey filled with loss and sadness at every turn. The more Mr. White took on his alter ego "Heisenberg", the more those he cared about the most suffered. The depth of the story increases with every episode as Walter continues to justify the often brutal decisions he makes as he becomes drunk with power, paying no mind to the obvious effects of those he supposedly cares so much about. Once his DEA agent brother in-law Hank, whose has been tormented by trying to track down "Heisenberg" finds out the truth he becomes so filled with rage, as a viewer you knew he would only wind up like all the rest. In the end Walt gets the only sort of personal redemption that was left for him. When the camera cut away in the final scene with Walter laying in a pool of blood in a meth lab it was the perfect ending to a masterpiece. Kudos Mr. Gilligan for this work of brilliance.
