The ONLY thing that disappoints me about this show is that I can't watch it again for the first time, so I am truly envious of anyone who hasn't seen it. The excitement that washes over you when watching this show for the first time is hard to describe. It is just amazing in every way, the filming, the scenes, the music, the storyline and of course the acting was AMAZING! And not just 1 actor in particular, I mean of course Bryan Cranston was superb, and Aaron Paul alike but ALL of the actors were great and they all made you love them in a different way. There is not a single minute of this show wasted with pointless storyline. Every single minute of all the 62 episodes keeps you entranced and wanting more. Even the slow areas have a significant story to tell and these moments are usually related to something that will happen later in the show. This is by far the best series I have EVER seen, if you haven't seen it please give it a chance, but be prepared to do nothing but watch breaking bad for the next 3 weeks because you literally won't be able to do anything else.
