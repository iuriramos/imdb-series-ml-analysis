Today (22/04/2014), i watched the last episode of the most awesome TV series that i ever watched! I'm crazy about series, i watch every kind with no restrictions, but no other series let me so speechless. The amazing performances from the actors, the complexity and transformation of the characters, the realism of the plot, the perfectionist way that the story is conducted, all the construction and development, every single detail was extremely well "architected" by the director, Vince Gilligan. A mixture of drama, suspense, psychological thriller, with the right pinch of comedy and action who makes you tense from the beginning to the end. Every new season is better than the previous and the series finale closes the story in a epic way. No wonder that Breaking Bad won so many awards, 63 at total in these 5 seasons. No wonder too, that even before the series ends, it was already considered cult. I highly recommend. I'm already missing Walt, Jesse, Saul, Gus, Mike, Hank, Albuquerque, Blue Crystal and everything about this series... Breaking bad it's not just a series. It is a work of art. "I am the one who knocks".
