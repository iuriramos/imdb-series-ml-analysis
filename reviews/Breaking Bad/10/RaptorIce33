Fantastic show. Everything about it is great. Such an thrilling ride. Most of the time it had me just saying wow that was awesome. If you want to be entertained watch this show. The acting is great all around. Cranston in particular is awesome as Walter White. It is incredible to see Walt transform from a nice guy to the ultimate bad ass. Despite all the things he does you find yourself rooting for him. The show is full of intense moments. So many times I kept thinking how are they going to get through this? I swear every episode ended with a fantastic cliffhanger with me begging for more. The weeks went by very slow. Lucky for people who haven't watched it yet they have every episode available and honestly watching this show from beginning to end the first time is awesome. The tension is great. Also a very underrated part of this show is the humor. Despite being the most tense, dramatic, and dark series out there, in my opinion it is also the funniest.
