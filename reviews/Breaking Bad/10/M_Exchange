I have almost completed watching it in its entirety for the second time. Maybe when I was a small child I watched a couple of shows such as Inspector Gadget and Heathcliff in their entirety, but in my adult years I mostly could not have cared less about TV and have watched only a handful of modern shows until this show was released on Netflix. It's the best TV show of all time, and it will probably have that distinction for decades to come, like the Beatles. I actually continue to like movies much more than TV shows, but I cannot even think of a movie that I like nearly as much as this show. The Beatles of movies has yet to be released, I guess. :)
