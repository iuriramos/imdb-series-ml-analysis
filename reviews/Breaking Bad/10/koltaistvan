The perfect series! I just discovered this whole mind blowing thing one year ago, but it hooked me in right after the pilot already. So I watched it 24/7 because I wanted to finish with it until the date of the series finale. I was even faster and I had the opportunity to watch the very last five episodes in time... Amazing story, magnificent acting, tremendous music. Everything in its right place. If you want to see only one series, I recommend to start with this. But you will be in danger, because you won't find another series until you finished watching Breaking Bad... Before I discovered BB, Dexter was my favorite, but they totally screwed up with the last season so I went awfully disappointed about it.
