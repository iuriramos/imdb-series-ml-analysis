Just finished watching S2 ,and ,i was amazed with these series. Was expecting story of cancer having teacher taking opportunity to make much money with making drug,got money get well....But after watching 3 episodes i saw i was wrong ,watched whole season 1 in one day, couldn't stop watching

Acting of Cranston (watched previously in Malcolm) is outstanding ,whole show is, but turning from ordinary teacher to drug making genius ,wow. Story is fantastic with so many twist and turns, especially liked relationship between Mr. White and Hank, and Mr.White and Jesse.

Best show i have ever seen....

Keep up...
