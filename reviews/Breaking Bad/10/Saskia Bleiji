Breaking Bad

In my opinion, this is one of the best shows ever. The story it self is one off the best ridden scripts ever. It' so incredibly detailed. But not in annoying way,it certainly is not lengthy story or something like that. You constantly want to know what' going to happen in the next episode when you just finished one. It is highly addictive show. Ironic to be addicted to show that' about methamphetamine. It is very sensational show, from the beginning to the end. Even after it ends, you will still think about it. Even when you don' like the subject of the show, you will love this show. Bryan Cranston, is fantastic actor, one off the best there is in my opinion. He plays the main character so good that you almost forget it isn't real. You gotta watch this, for sure!!
