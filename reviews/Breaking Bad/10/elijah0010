This is the best show on television. Nowadays the shows that are so- called "main-stream" overrun the channels, but there are a few that detach from that group. And in that group there is that 1 show, the show that leaves you aching for the next season premiere, the show that overshadows all the others. That show is Breaking Bad.

This is by-far the best television program I have ever watched. It has that older Tarantino-Scorsese style and flow to it. Like the Pulp Fiction Tarantino and the Goodfellas Scorsese. In order to prove how exhilarating this show is I have to compare to the ELITE writers and directors in cinema. I can't just say that Vince Gilligan made a show I have to say that he made THE show. THE show that movie-lovers adore and can't wait for to air.

GIVE THE SHOW A CHANCE. I know many people that say this, "I don't condemn a teacher selling meth". Walter White isn't involved with drugs to sniff and puff. He is involved in order to support his family after he dies because he is diagnosed with lung cancer. So go on NETFLIX and watch the first 4 seasons of the show. It will be worth your while.
