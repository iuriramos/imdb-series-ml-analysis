Breaking Bad is the best TV Show ! The best Casting Ever, people perform well. Bryan Cranston was for this. Jesse and all others. We have to admit it. Giancarlo was simply perfect in his character, Simple, Great. He was perfect for this also. I was hoping for a season six but I think the end say it all. Vince you're the best writer. All episode was wonderful. Each episode watched make you say 'another one'. You just can't sleep. Especially in the season four and five. Skyler sometimes, she asked too much and Marie just make me out of my mind but I think it was the point. I almost cried when they shoot Hank. If they didn't I think we could reach season eight but it's done. I'm waiting for another TV show like that.
