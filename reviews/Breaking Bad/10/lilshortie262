After I finished watching the fourth season finale of Dexter I starting looking for a show to watch that could tide me over until the next season started, so I decided to check out Breaking Bad. I picked this show because I used to watch Malcolm and the Middle and noticed how popular it was. I hadn't really paid any attention to the commercials so I didn't know what the show was about before watching. I was surprised when I watched the pilot episode. I thought he was going to be playing another version of Hal(Malcolm in the Middle) when I first saw Bryan Cranston standing in the middle of the desert wearing tighty whities. Boy was I wrong. I was hooked from the very first episode. The show has amazing actors and writers. It is not surprising this show has won so many awards. I only wish I had started watching this when it first came on. Like so many other great shows, I started watching it after it became very successful so I ended up staying up all night watching the first three seasons in three days.
