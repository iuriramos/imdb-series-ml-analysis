The Breaking bad show has set a trend..this show created history in the TV series world. i have seen many TV-series..popular ones like Dexter, Mentalist, Bones, All started out good and ended a disaster...But breaking bad has never disappointed me.never in one episode..it always set my blood up high..and believe me..not everything impresses me. The character Heisenberg is a Kingpin in drug world..but he is shown like a normal guy..no big deal guy..a powerful guy..feels like a real alive character when all the way you see it..Bryan cranston is perfect match for the charactr..and all the episodes are carefullly written by the master writer Vince gillian..YOU CAN DEFINITELY WATCH IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PERFECT DRAMA WITH ENERGY..YOU CANT GET BETTER THAN THIS..I TRIED !!!
