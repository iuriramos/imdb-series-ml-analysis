This is the best ever TV show in the history, which I think. This Sunday will be last episode but I want to watch more episodes. Please don't get end. I hope this kind of serial would come in market in future. Walter White is the best ever actor. What an acting is done by him. I become a fan of Walter Whiter (Bryan Cranston) Jesse Pinkman is also the best actor. All character played their role seriously and let this show at the top of the list and it is therefore list in the world genius 2014 book. I started to watch it on 2013. I bought season 1 and I was unable to stop my self and in a week I completed 2 seasons and then at the start of the September I meet closer to aMc. I don't want to wait more for the last episode. Sunday please come closer :). At the last I would like to add is that, I will miss breaking bad <3
