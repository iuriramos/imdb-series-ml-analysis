How can a TV show make u hooked like this, like you had a dope :). Excellent!!!Stunning!!!spectacular!!!its a master piece.Great Story elevated to a new level by Bryan Cranston. what an actor!!! Now started watching anything with his name on it. He was a hero, comedian, villain everything in this show. All in one.

Great story line,you cannot predict whats next. Each and every episode from first to last is well connected. No unnecessary characters or scenes. Watch the first few episodes then you cannot stop watching it.Few scenes i really liked that i watched it over and over again. the one where he buys a new car, he asks the drug dealer to say his name and every scene in the finale.WOW!!!! i can go on and on about this. This will always stay my favorite and never i think anything can beat this. Great Show!!!
