If you are looking for a series that you want to enjoy more than any other TV series I'll suggest you to watch Breaking Bad.This series is far better than any other TV series I've ever seen and believe me I've seen many good series but no other series came even close to Breaking Bad.Everything about BB is just so simple and yet so good you'll end up amazed or shocked many times throughout the series.BB is like an everyday struggle of a common man who is forced to do extraordinary things that will shatter lives of many individuals.Strong performances from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul.I'll say simply best TV series ever made and also no other series in future can take place of BB. #YoBitch
