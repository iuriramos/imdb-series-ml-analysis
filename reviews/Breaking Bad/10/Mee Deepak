This was my first English show and i totally loved it i am writing this because i really appreciate it. All i want to do is to give huge round of applause."Breaking Bad" is the best television show. Ever. This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of Grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines. Get on your couch now and start watching "Breaking Bad" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene.I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I am to Breaking Bad before
