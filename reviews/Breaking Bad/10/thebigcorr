Don't read this unless you have seen "Felina," the series finale of AMC's "Breaking Bad." From a structural standpoint, it's hard to be too hard on the "Breaking Bad" finale as a discrete unit. The last hour of the series took all the story threads that were still dangling and wrapped them up, not quite in an elegant bow -- more like a blood-drenched metal chain.

In the last few scenes, creator Vince Gilligan, who wrote and directed the finale, went with a Shakespearean solution, one of those "and then everybody died" situations that you find at the end of some of the Bard's plays. Out in the New Mexico desert, the bright, shining exception to the general bloodbath was Jesse, whose deliriously relieved exit from the Nazi compound was the best moment of the finale.

In many ways, that hour felt like the show's final destination; the story and the people went furthest they could go in a dozen ways. It placed many viewers (including myself) into an emotional and psychological vise and made "Game of Thrones'" Red Wedding look like a cocktail party. "Ozymandias" was hard to watch, but it was the culmination of almost every idea, theme and story the past five seasons had set in motion. It braided together everything that makes "Breaking Bad" phenomenal and was nearly toxic in its crystalline purity. It was majestic, cathartic, harrowing and great.
