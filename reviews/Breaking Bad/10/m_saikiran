First three seasons were awesome,Bryan Cranston did justice to his character Walter white.Only point I dint like is skyler's relationship with ted(even though it was for short duration)apart from this all three seasons are great. chemistry lecturer cooking meth to make money very interesting.

But I think fourth season is going out of track.....

but I am waiting for what would be the end as gus and walter are trying to terminate each other,also hank behind gus which would put walter in front of hanks gun.

trust me give a try
