At first I was really skeptical the storyline respective. I thought that there would be a lot of comedy in it. There is humor in it but it is not that typical type of humor. Sometimes you have to laugh but at the same moment you are often shocked too. Your smile could freeze sometimes. :) After I've watched a few episodes now I'm totally convinced that this is one of the best TV shows ever! The characters appear very realistic, the camera angles are brilliant. Every episode has a surprising beginning, the endings are just art! What I like most are the pictures and the artful way to show objects and details. I've never seen this in any other TV show before. 

This isn't only a TV show, this is art! One of my all-time favorite TV shows! I just love it!
