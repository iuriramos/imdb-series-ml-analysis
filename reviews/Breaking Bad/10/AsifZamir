Of course I didn't find out about this show until the series was concluded. Breaking Bad is an up in the now American crime drama television series produced and created by Vince Gilligan. The setting of Breaking Bad is Albuquerque New Mexico. It is about a high school chem teacher who is terminally ill with lung cancer. At this diagnosis Walter White (Bryan Cranston) turns about face to a life of violent crime, and turns to the drug trade, manufacturing and selling high quality methamphetamine with former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul).

Top series writers are Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould, George Mastras, Sam Catlin and Moira Walley-Beckett. Breaking Bad has won ten prime-time Emmy awards and Cranston took three wins consecutively for Best Actor.

Breaking Bad was one of the America's top leading TV shows and portrays violence, crime and intrigue. If you want to sit down for a good pique of your interest, then this series is the place to be.

But it's more than just great entertainment, Breaking Bad transcends typical crime dramas. Walter White has been the underdog his whole life. He's been taken advantage of and had bad luck at every turn. He's never achieved his dreams, never done anything courageous. And now he has a short time to live. He's always been a clean cut, honourable man. Until now. He's dying. He wants to make money to support his family. Most of all, he wants to make up for the time he feels he wasted. This drives him to do things that would make you hate any other man, but not Walter - no, you'll root for him to win.

This is the greatest TV show ever made, and every other show will have to sit at the kids table.
