Breaking Bad - to me is the best TV series out there so far. That itself i still reckon is an understatement of how good this show is.

It is pretty obvious : This show pretty much sums up what Breaking Bad means, "turning to the darkside" - pretty much for good. I enjoyed how the Director and the script writer gives you an authentic feeling to this TV Series. At times, you can feel the characters in there, share their sentiment - provided that you have been following this series since day one.

Most of my mates complained that this TV series is "too slow - dramatic", at times I will admit, it is pretty dramatic - but in a good sense of the word. It puts you in the front seat, witnessing how good turns to bad, and bad becomes to worst. Breaking Bad is unique, and when I say unique, it is not your usual day to day TV series. Not your usual "big bang theory, the mentalist, how i met your mother" series. Breaking Bad for me stands out among the rest, because every episode is crafted to perfection.

I doubt I will be able to put in words how good Breaking Bad is, and how much I've enjoyed it. Name me a TV series that you reckon in the last 5 years is good, and I'll assure you Breaking Bad is better.
