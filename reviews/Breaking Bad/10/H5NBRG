Why you ask? Because it had me hooked from the start. I just finished watching it over for the second time. And still, knowing what was going to happen, I could not wait for the next episode. 

Sure it's not for everyone.. If you'd rather have an action packed show filled with gun fights and tits in your face, this isn't for you. But when you do have the patience and understand what's going on.. This show will not disappoint you. 

Characters are very well acted out by the very good actors. You really feel for them. Whether they do good or wrong. They had me hating some people on the show with so much passion.. My point, you can really get in to it. Relate with them. 

If you haven't seen the show yet, I'm jealous because you're in for one hell of a ride. Definitely a must see show!
