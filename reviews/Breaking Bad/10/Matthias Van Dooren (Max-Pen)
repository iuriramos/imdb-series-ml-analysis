This is my first review on IMDb and until now I didn't feel like writing one. That is until I saw Breaking Bad. 

This is perhaps the best TV show in history. The things that happen in Breaking Bad are unpredictable and amazing. This show also keeps builds up very well and feels very natural and realistic. 

I also have a strong connection to the characters in this show. I feel what they experience. This show really touches me and its sometimes very exiting to watch it. That you are on the edge of your seat and can't stop watching the show.

I don't know of any other TV series that matches the same quality as that of Breaking Bad. I think Breaking Bad has reached a quality level that no other TV series will match ever.

Thank you for reading my review. I really recommend the TV series to watch it.
