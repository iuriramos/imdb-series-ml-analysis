This is the best show I've ever seen and not at all on a subject I thought I'd have a remote interest in. The characters are perfectly flawed, the story telling is smart, the pacing excellent and the wrap-up in the final season is everything you could want. You find that you're breathing heavily as a major story arch is achieved, another wrinkle added to the layers of deception and more intrigue building between various characters (some related, some not) than you thought was possible. The show is such a spectacle, it ends up carrying itself easily and bringing you along for the ride. Better hang on, it's a roller-coaster! Bryan Cranston IS Walter White, aka-Heisenberg. SAY HIS NAME!!!
