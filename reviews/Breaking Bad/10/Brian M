When talking about TV shows Breaking Bad is bound to be mentioned. Why? Because its unlike anything else on TV, the acting is better in this TV show, than quite a lot of movies, combined. The writers thought out every last detail, and made a compelling, incredibly acted TV show, that you will never forget after watching it. 

I usually don't follow trends/popular TV shows and such, and I had heard of Breaking Bad, but never really paid much mind to it, and thought to myself "why is this show so popular". So a friend of mine said it was awesome, so I gave it a shot. One season became 2, then 3 Until I finished it. It is truly an experience, and a roller coaster ride of emotions. The acting is incredible, as is the writing and directing. Just an amazing show that needs to be seen. -10/10
