As someone who has been watching TV for a long time I can safely say that Breaking Bad is the greatest of them all.

Every aspect of the show is phenomenal.

The acting, of course, is top notch. The writing is brilliant and never predictable.

The cinematography is gorgeous. I have driven through Albuquerque and it is certainly not as memorable as the makes it out to be. That is a compliment to show, not a knock on the city itself.

Another important thing the show-runners did to make Breaking Bad stand out is to know when to end it. Lesser shows extend themselves beyond the point where the quality can't be maintained. Breaking Bad is a rare gem that will remembered and studied for years.
