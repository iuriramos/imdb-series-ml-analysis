Gliding Over All, Just as Breaking Bad always has been.

Not since The Wire have I seen a show capable of expressing such a quickfire of different genres or emotions, this drama is of the highest class superior to all else.

The greatest to date, without equal. The conclusion reduced me to tears, and just showcased that even when Breaking Bad was ending, it could still force me to laugh and cry at consecutive times, within seconds(When Walt shoots Jack, and when Jesse drives from the lab).

It has changed me, and has also made me think twice about decision making, and helped me think of ways to stay one step ahead of a situation, even when you're looking despair in the face.

Goodbye Walt.
