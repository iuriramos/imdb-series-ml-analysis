Breaking Bad has to be the best show on air to this date, which may sound like an arrogant claim, but once you give it a try I have no doubt you'll agree with me. Now I'm not going to spoil everything so I'll give my best attempt of a synopsis: Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher, and his family are experiencing some money troubles. When Walter is diagnosed with lung cancer he 'breaks bad' teaming up with a former student of his who is a distributor of drugs, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). Walt plans for he and Jesse to make enough money from the drug business before he dies so that he can leave his family with enough money to last a lifetime, but as Walt finds out - It is easier said than done.

The writing is brilliant, the acting is exceptional and the shows pace is perfect. Breaking Bad is a crime drama that should not be missed, so go out there and start watching - but tread lightly, because Walter White is a man not to be messed with!
