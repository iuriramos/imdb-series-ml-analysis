Definitely one of the all time best. Pitch-perfect story-telling with pitch-perfect acting. Not every episode is a masterpiece, but enough are to make the series a stunning television achievement and a must watch for anyone looking for quality programming. As the series explores the ups and downs of Bryan Cranston's everyman, and as circumstances force the everyman to spiral in and out of control, the viewer is caught up in the often compassionate and touching, and often horrifying and gut-wrenching situations and decisions he haphazardly or possibly in a state of panic, makes for a decidedly misguided (but wholly understandable) purpose. The love, the hate, the forgiveness, the revenge, the humor, the sadness, the loyalty, the betrayal, the goodness, and the evil, it's all there, and it's done to perfection. Watch this man make the ultimate sacrifice for what may or may not be the ultimate reason (and was it really worth it). Fortunately for the rest of us, this journey was totally worth it.
