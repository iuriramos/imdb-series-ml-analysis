What's not to love with this show? Vince Gilligan has a masterpiece in every aspect with Breaking Bad. This show takes you through a story of Mr. White as he goes from Chemistry teacher to drug kingpin. How does such a simple teacher turn into one of the most insanely entertaining characters in TV history? Gilligan figured out how in the most profound way with Breaking Bad. Walter White gets diagnosed with cancer and teams up with local drug dealer and former student Jesse Pinkman. The duo seems unorthodox, but they make it work. Through the story, Walt has to deal with family problems, issues with other drug dealers, and the law. The story starts slower to develop the characters, but as everyone is introduced, the story picks up into one wild ride. This show has the best character development of any TV show that I have ever seen. Walter White goes from quiet teacher to the craziest anti-hero that has ever been imagined, and his parter Jesse Pinkman goes from a small time dealer to someone who just wants to survive. The challenges are larger than life and at times Jesse finds it all to be too much, much because of Mr. White himself. These two are a duo of a lifetime. Because of how fantastic this show is, there is no surprise that Breaking Bad has won countless awards and recognitions along the way. There really is nothing wrong with the show as it keeps your attention all the way to the last scene. Truly worth the time to sit and appreciate quite possibly the greatest show of all time!
