The story of a high school chemistry teacher turned Methamphetamine kingpin is the best show to grace Netflix. Walter White and Jessie Pinkman make the perfect duo with the blend of smart and street smart. Later character Gustavo Fring is professional with every action, down to taking his suit off to vomit the poison given to the Cartel. Saul Goodman is a laugh worthy character and was completely unforgettable with his slow madness decent. The show is absolutely amazing and I will never forget every heart felt moment and yellow hazard suit. The area of New Mexico will never be the same after the infamous drug cook Heisenberg was sadly shot and died in a methamphetamine lab of his design. Jessie's final moments of driving away and laughing made me feel a blend of emotions, sad yet pleased.
