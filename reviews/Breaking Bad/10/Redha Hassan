Extremely good show.

I think this is the best show I have ever seen in my life and it is very difficult that another show steal this position.

It is like a combination between Drama, Action, Comedy, Thriller.

It is absolutely everything.

Definitely recommend everyone to watch it.

The director succeeded to attract me until the end of the show. The first parts of the show was a little bit boring. However, by the time you will feel that you cannot stop watching the rest of the episodes to see what will happen after all.
