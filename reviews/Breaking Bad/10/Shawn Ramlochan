I knew Breaking Bad was going to be amazing when I first saw the pilot. It had potential beyond my expectations, as the episodes went on I felt like I was going deeper and deeper inside the mind of my favorite anti-hero of all time; Walter White. This show is up there with greats such as The Sopranos and The Wire. I must thank Vince Gilligan and his mad genius for making this show possible and giving me 5 brilliant seasons, the only show that has had 5/5 perfect seasons (so far, I think True Detective has potential). The writing is amazing and the dialogue seems so real, it's also given us some of the most iconic quotes in television history, such as "bi***", "I am not in danger, I am the danger", "I am the one who knocks" and so much more. I can guarantee you that Breaking Bad is the greatest show of all time.
