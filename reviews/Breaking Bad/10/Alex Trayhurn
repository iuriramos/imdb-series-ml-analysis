"Breaking bad" is the meaning for someone who is following an otherwise normal and moral lifestyle decides to "break bad" and enter into an immoral or an illegal lifestyle. Perfectly sums up this series, Walter White, an Overqualified Chemistry teacher gets diagnosed with stage III cancer and decides to adopt a life of crime and deception as a maker of meth amphetamine with "Jessie Pinkman" or "Captain Cook" a high-school drop-out and was taught Chemistry by Walter. As they pair up and develop the best recipe in the business. When Walt gets diagnosed he has the hard choice of how his family will cope financially. 

As he makes his way up the meth making ladder until he starts to attract attention from other drug gangs, the Mexican cartel and Evan the DEA (Drug enforcement agency) in which Walts brother in law works for. Walt and Jessie begin to go through many distributors like Tuco Salamanca and Gustavo Fring. 

This show is a very good with good portrayal of characters from the main characters like Walt and Jessie to the smaller characters like Saul and Mike they all are very good. They wrap all of the series up at the end mostly although they usually add a cliff-hanger. In any circumstance I would give this show 10/10 purely because of its plot and unravelling. It is no wonder that it is the number 1 show in America because of its mix of humour and seriousness of a serious subject.
