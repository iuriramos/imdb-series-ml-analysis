"Breaking Bad" is the darkest show on TV, and possibly the best. The main character, Walt White, is a high school chemistry teacher with cancer, a pregnant wife, a disabled son, and no savings. Hoping to leave a nest egg when he dies, he teams up with a young lowlife and begins cooking crystal meth. Walt and his accomplice are in way over their heads, and get into one harrowing scrape after another, from stranding themselves in the desert to being kidnapped by a psycho drug lord. 

Deep ironies abound. Walt's double life entangles him in so many lies he can't keep track of them all. This damages his relationship with his family (who were the reason he started cooking meth in the first place). Unforeseen complications keep sabotaging Walt's drug operation and eating into the money he makes. As he puts it, everything is "one step forward, two steps back." 

"Breaking Bad" approaches its characters with a penetrating sense of human frailty and zero sentimentality. Though Walt's a sympathetic character, he does many unsympathetic things. His wife, loyal and moral almost to a fault, nurses a secret crush on a former boss. Walt's young accomplice has an inconvenient streak of decency, but not enough to overcome his own essential weakness and stupidity.

The hypocrisy and "quiet desperation" of middle-class suburban life have been worked to death in books, movies, and TV. "Breaking Bad" gives these themes new life with clear-eyed, pitiless characterizations, brilliant acting, gripping plot twists, imaginative visual style, and grim black humor. The nearest analogy I can think of is to Flaubert's "Madame Bovary." "Breaking Bad" is a masterpiece.
