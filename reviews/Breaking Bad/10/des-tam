Like i was watching an ancient Greek drama!! I want to express so many feelings that i have inside me,since i finished the series,but my English are awful!! When i finished the 1st season,i said ,OK,good,lets see the 2nd season,even if i don't understand all this noise for this series...When i finished the 2nd season,i said,OK a little bit better,but still...After the 3rd season,i was anxious to see the 4th,which was great!!When i was watching the 5th,especially the last 8 episodes,i was sad,because i knew that this masterpiece is going over!!And its over with the most wonderful finale!And then,all the pieces from every season,they took place in my mind!!Sad because its over...happy because i saw this perfection!! THANK you creators for this wonderful TV experience!!
