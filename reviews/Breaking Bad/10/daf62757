For over a year, I had a chance to watch this show on Comcast ON DEMAND. I watched the first episode of season two a couple of times, but never got past the first five or so minutes.

Out of boredom, I finally got past the first few minutes and to be honest, I was blown away! The acting is first rate and the plot has more twists and turns that a roller coaster at Six Flags.

I bought all of season on on Itunes to complete my knowledge of the show and then season 3 started.

Last night I just watched the next to last season 3 episode. After a few shows that seemed the season was just dragging to a close, the final 10 seconds had me jumping to my feet screaming "Oh my God!".

Now I can't wait for the season finale to come, and yet I will hate for the season to finish and wait another 8 or so months for season 4 to start.

All in all, one of the best dramas I have ever seen. I know this show can't last forever, but it ranks right up there with the best of these cable TV series that last 10 to 13 episodes. Funny, serious, outrageous, sometimes stupid....but hey, its a fantasy right.
