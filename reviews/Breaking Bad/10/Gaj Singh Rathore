You can't think of a TV series this good,,to be fact bound this is probably the best work done on an electronic device which has a display(TV..:)), Bryan Cranston is so so addictive that if you have ever had METH you could survive its scarcity in times of need but when it comes to watching him act your urge will kill you. i think this much is enough to review a title this "great"...in fact a new word to define the excellence of this TV series should be mentioned. "Methylvalous". To talk about the supporting cast Aaaron Paul has done a fantastic job,,in fact a fantastic act.he portrays a character of a spoilt school going brat who is secretively into making meth along side his schooling to earn money and goes on to partner his school chemistry teacher(Bryan Cranston) in making the world's purest blue meth. Anna Gunn,Dean Norris,Betsy Brandt and of course Wlater Jr. do play their part very well. All in all you cannot ask for a more Dark comical tragic Thriller TV serial.
