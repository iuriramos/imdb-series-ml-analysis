Awesome simply awesome. Its the only TV series that I watched twice. The story line is so well built up. The action direction screenplay all top notch. It does not have any super hero kinda thing or something like that but, still the intensity it creates is hands down. While watching it you feel like that these things can actually happen with you. At first u feel like its some boring kinda story but, as u keep watching through all the episodes u simply start loving them. Wow a 10/10 from me. And please a request from me to the producers. Please don't even think of producing a season 6. Its a classic and has the perfect ending for me
