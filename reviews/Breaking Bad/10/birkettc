What can I say about Breaking Bad that hasn't already been said? It's easily one of the most addictive shows ever to come on air, and that's mainly down to the actors. The dialogue written for them and then spoken is flawless, there isn't a line too many in the whole thing. When there's just silence, the reactions by each of the actors to what's going on keeps the whole thing captivating. 

Bryan Cranston, who was, before this, mainly just known for the X-Files and Malcolm in the Middle, was perfectly cast, and it's done so well you can easily sympathize with him, but, as it goes on, when he starts to change more and more into Heisenberg, you start to hate him, and Cranston's flawless performance was what made this happen. The rest of the cast are equally good, from the hot-headed Aaron Paul, to the well-meaning but dangerous Dean Norris, to the concerned and independent housewife Anna Gunn. 

The music really adds something else to it, using a great selection of songs that just fit the mood of the storyline being told at that time. Although the directors frequently change from episode to episode, the show has a great consistency from the style to the tempo.

As Walter White said at the beginning of season 1, "Chemistry is the study of change", we can do nothing but watch as Walter White, a dull high school professor transforms, over the course of 62 episodes, into a ruthless meth cook who tries to explain all his actions with simple excuses. But if you haven't watched it yet, then what's your excuse?
