Breaking Bad is my favorite show, and in my opinion, one of the best TV shows ever. This show has been made from the ground up to create something so amazing, that it's going to get a prequel some time this year to keep things going. Basically, it's like nothing is going to stop the train (you'll get that reference later).

The character development in this show is mind-blowing. It can make a completely sane person in the show go into a deep state of depression, or someone who is a horrible person who has done horrible things. Yes, that's an important factor in any show, but in this show, you get to compare these characters from the beginning of the series to the final season and not recognize them. Not only physically, but in their emotional state, as well. The story plays a much more important factor in that, as well. So many plot twists, and so much creativity that you just wish other shows were just like this one. After you're done watching this, you'll be left wanting more. It's basically like drugs.

Overall, this show is what other shows strive to become. It excels in everything; the story, the characters, the depth, EVERYTHING. With this, I can proudly say that this is the best show AMC has ever had. Yes, it beats The Walking Dead, and yes it beats Mad Men.
