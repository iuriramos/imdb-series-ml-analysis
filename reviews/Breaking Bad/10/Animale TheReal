I just finished this series, at 6-6-2015

Being introduced by a relative into the series-craze, I'm kind of a late starter. I first saw the 'Better call Saul' series..which came after Breaking Bad but it plays before that time...which is brilliant...as everything about it is.

I have nothing to add to what is already said, I guess. Breaking Bad is not just a TV-series, it's a piece of art, made by the most critical of filmmakers to satisfy even the most critical of film viewers.

The way they created a cinematic puzzle that all fits, let the viewer use his own imagination at first, and then comes up with an even better solution every time, is a joy.

Every genre is represented at it's finest, humor, horror, love, family, drama, crime, thriller, you name it, this series's got it. Mindbending, totally unexpected twists.

I hesitated a little before giving this the full score...but there's nothing better out there that's made so good within the created lives of ordinary people. How could they make this better? Normally I have tons of ideas...with this series, I really have not.

Therefore: a 10.
