I have always been more of a movie fan than a TV series fan but recently there have been a number of television productions which have changed my opinion. Breaking Bad has been one such show. Gripping, intense and 100% believable- the series tells the tale of a high school chemistry teacher who turns to cooking crystal meth with a former student in order to provide for his family knowing that his life is due to be cut short as he is diagnosed with lung cancer. Bryan Cranston is truly amazing as the protagonist- initially an amiable, family orientated character, the story displays his change in personality- quickly becoming the most important asset in the meth trade. Cranston is the star of the show but he is supported by a superb cast. Fully deserved of all the accolades, awards and critical acclaim, this series will suck you in and spit you out. I don't want to spoil the story line so I will simply recommend that you watch it. Not to sound clich√©d but this is truly ground breaking viewing. The direction and storyline makes you empathise and sympathise with the wonderful characters. Truly magnificent.
