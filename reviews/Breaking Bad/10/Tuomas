Honestly I have to say that this is the best TV-series I have ever seen. I simply can't find a fault in it. The story is very interesting and it is developing so well and after all it is even quite plausible. 

Walter White is great, as well as Jesse Pinkman, and there is nothing bad to say about the other characters either. This whole being quiet thing though remains as a question; for me as a Scandinavian it is OK and natural, but I have always thought that the Americans are just not capable of that. But perhaps it really is like that in a professional drug business, no empty words are said or nothing unnecessary. In a way I just love this mysteria this creates, people come and go, some even keeping themselves totally unknown. Everything is not explained and totally covered like in some series.

What I especially love is how these characters develop. From the beginning to the close of end it is sometimes hard to even imagine them to be the same actors, same characters. But in the end that is how it goes in real life too; someone you used to know five years ago might not be at all the same... People change so quickly, especially under the pressure.
