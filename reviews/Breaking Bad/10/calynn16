I hadn't watched this show until I heard Louis Ferreira was going to be in it. He is the best actor, and if they keep him on the show, I will be watching every week. Louis is the most gifted and talented actor ever. I can vision his character being just what the show needed, to take them to the next level. Louis can accelerate this show to the top of its potential. If you were a fan of the show before Louis, just wait, you haven't seen anything yet. He will blow your mind, and nobody could play this type of role better than him. To all you Louis fan's, I know you all feel as strongly about him as I do. Good call BB casting! Your lucky to have him. Treat him right!
