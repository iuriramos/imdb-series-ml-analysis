Breaking Bad is, without a doubt, the best TV drama ever made. There have been a few I've missed, but from everything I've ever watched, there has never been anything more complete than this series. It is simply something not to be missed.

The acting, writing, directing, producing, everything is the best I've ever seen. There is rarely, in all 5 seasons, a dull moment, and there has never been anything like it. I've never, ever given an '10' to a TV show before, but nothing has ever deserved it until this.

It's not for kids. If it had a rating, it would be at least a PG-13, if not R. If you are going to let teens watch, make sure they watch until the end of the series, because the beginning might make it seem 'cool' to be making and doing meth. It's not until the end of the last season that you see things come full circle.

There is no point in going over every season or episode because you need to watch them all anyway. But I will state that it is rare that one program has this much talent, and to watch the main characters slowly morph into something completely different than they were is magical.

All the people involved, especially Vince Gilligan, deserve every award they receive and every paycheck they earn, if not more. The show is brilliant and for the first time ever, I'm actually going to be sad a series is over. They will be missed in my house.
