The one TV show that will make you say "Oh my God, that's amazing!" So off-the-hook awesome! I was addicted the first episode. 10 OUT OF 10! It makes you fascinated in criminology and makes you want to scream when something horrible happens. You'll be pleased and be paying attention the whole time. 

It makes you think though... the fact that there are actual people out there like that. It makes your blood curdle in a good way. That way where you just want to watch and read everything interesting there is to watch and read. I don't recommend for children though for many reasons...

..To many adult references. 

But other that that, ha, WOW. So good. Watch it! Watch it now! :D
