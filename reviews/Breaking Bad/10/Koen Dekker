In the beginning indeed a bit slow, but keep watching because it's definitely worth it. The actors did a great job, i was just amazed by the work of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. After finishing an episode you just cannot wait 'til the next episode. And every episode is fun from the beginning until the end, there are no boring moments. Following the life of a chemistry teacher that turns into a bad-ass meth cook just doesn't get boring. I give this series a 10/10 because it's just flawless. I would recommend everyone to watch it, but keep in mind that there are some disturbing moments, viewer discretion is advised. Amazing series.
