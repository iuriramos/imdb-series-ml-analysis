where do I start!... after watching this entire series start to finish I can say this series puts almost every emotion you can think of into every episode I have watched episodes where I have been sad, annoyed, left in shock and on many occasions laughed so much I have near enough drowned in my own laughter tears Bryan Cranston plays Walter white a once respected school chemistry teacher diagnosed with lung cancer too crystal meth cook and Aaron Paul plays Jesse Pinkman an ex failed student of Mr whites who now cooks sells and takes methamphetamine on a regular basis the pair form an unstoppable team when they find Mr white can make the perfect 'blue' meth the series shows the brutality of the illegal drug industry and the real horrendous affects that can be caused by the drug while Walter attempts to hid the fact that he is a major drug king pin from his wife and son while trying too also raise a baby daughter the show shows both Walter and Jesse's rises and falls and there health slowly worsens while adding some unforgettable funny moments in too.

a must see series 10/10!
