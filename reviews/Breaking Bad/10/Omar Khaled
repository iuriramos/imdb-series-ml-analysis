I haven't seen a perfect structure like this in my whole life. Astonishing plot, hilarious directing, fabulous performance. All these assemble together forming this splendid show. How would angels become devils and devils become angels! This evil which is inside all of us varies from someone to another. Some people can restrain it. Others surrender to it letting it ruin their lives. How can this evil justify every sinful deed we do! Pride, desire, arrogance and selfishness how can they destroy someone's life even if they were protected by extreme caution and intelligence. All these questions were put up in this show in a perfect way. 

Although I don't like watching series as much as I like watching movies, I haven't enjoyed anything like this before. I have fallen in love with the figures that I was very sad at the last episode because I didn't want it to end, moreover, I have watched this whole series in only 7 days.
