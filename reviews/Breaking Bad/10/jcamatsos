I usually don't write reviews, but I felt i HAD to for this epic series. For the past 3 years my brother has been bugging me to watch Breaking Bad, and finally I got around to it after moving to a Greek island, thus having more free time on my hands. All I can say is WOW. I can't believe what I missed the past 5 years! After watching the full 5 series in less than 2 weeks, I was left speechless after most episodes, and wanted more, sometimes taking me into the night until 2-3 am. Every episode is brilliantly written, directed, & produced. What can I say about the acting? Every single actor in this series deserves the highest awards. This show will go down as one of the all time greatest (if not THE BEST). HEISENBERG forever!
