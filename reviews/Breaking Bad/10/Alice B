There are popular TV series which have been over-hyped. Breaking Bad is definitely not one of them.

Focusing on the rise and fall of Walter White, a family man and chemistry teacher turned drug dealer, Breaking Bad is the perfect example of excellent television that only gets better season by season as the plot thickens and intensifies, with gripping story lines and twists which are impossible to predict.

At times through this show you will be shocked by the lengths to which these characters will go to achieve what they want, yet the story does not get unbelievable, as you are taken in to everything that happens and the character development is incredible.

The charcacters in this show are complex and compelling, and throughout the seasons your opinions of them are sure to be constantly changing. Bryan Cranston is at his best as Walter White, and his dynamic with Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman is one of the most interesting aspects of the show. Saul Goodman (who stars in spin off Better Call Saul) is entertaining as the shady lawyer here, and Gus Fring is a thrilling villain who is more terrifying the more his character is developed.

As I mentioned earlier, this show only gets better as it goes along, and by the fifth and final season you will not be able to stop watching. Breaking Bad is very dark at times, and the violence and drug use make it quite a mature show, but if that doesn't put you off then you are sure to be thrilled by the complexity and genius of the story.

So don't miss out, and see for yourself why Breaking Bad is popular with critics and fans alike.
