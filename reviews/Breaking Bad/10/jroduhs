Breaking Bad puts a whole new perspective on any television series before it. This action/adventure goes places that other television shows wouldn't even dare to look. Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher, is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With a pregnant wife and son with cerebral palsy, he knows he needs to make some quick money to support them after he is gone. He quickly falls into the drug world with a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), cooking and selling one of the most potent and dangerous drugs known to man, methamphetamine. While he is trying to make a more stable life for his family, he must watch as his own life spirals out of control.
