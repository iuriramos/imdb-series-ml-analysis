There is only one other show that could come close to rivaling Breaking Bad and that was The X- Files. I own all 9 seasons of The X-Files on DVD, and now Breaking Bad has taken 1st place on my list of Television Show Must Owns.

I'm not one to watch TV series year after year, but Vince Gilligan and crew created one heck of a masterpiece.

This wasn't a show which glorified drug use and crime (as I've had to explain to many who never cared enough to watch prior to making comments); it was a show about the human condition and what happens when ordinary people are placed within extraordinary situations.

What would you do, and how would you do it? 

The concept of morality, good versus evil, black and white, or is morality only shades of gray... I've never seen any show deal with these concepts better than Breaking Bad.

Every single Emmy the show and cast received was very well earned.
