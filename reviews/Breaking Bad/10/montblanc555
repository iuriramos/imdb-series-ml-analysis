Crime does pay or maybe not. The entire series revolves around drugs from cooking, substance abuse to consequences. To me anything to do with drug movies is just plain boring. Bunch of junkies sticking it up their veins and drug cartels running rings. However, the approach to this drama is new. The suspense packed episodes overdose you and make you an addict yourself to the show. Acting is excellent and the entire cast does justice to their scripts. Most of the characters are so well developed that even the bad guys leave a lasting impression. If you want to watch a good series nothing gets better. Most TV shows fizzle out after 1-3 seasons this one keeps getting you the chills. Get the series now and a must watch for all. Its not just about drugs there is more than it meets the eye.
