Some TV dramas deserve 10's and this is one of them. May be the greatest TV drama ever written. May be better than the Sopranos. Visceral, scary, exhilarating, funny, excitingly vengeful,sad, pitiful, intelligent... .

Never has any two actors so filled the screen in one show and grabbed one than both stars with Cranston grabbing more due to his incredibly stellar screen presence, but I think we are in for surprises from Paul in future roles.

Cranston was born for this role. Cranston was born to act and does so with such convincing conviction I never thought he was acting at any point. The same goes for Paul and really, most every other actor, including Norris who was stellar and Gunn, Brandt and Mitte.

Yes I'm gushing but who doesn't with such a great show.

Thanks AMC. Your the channel to beat nowadays.
