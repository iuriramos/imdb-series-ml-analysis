I procrastinated watching this show when a friend recommended it and I regret it so much. The show had me hooked from the very first episode. I loved everything from the storyline to the casting and direction. 

I think the main thing that interested me is the drastic character development of Walter White and how evil takes over his relatable original character gradually through every season. Even though Walter was my main interest at first I started to favour other characters like Jesse, Hank, Mike and Gus. By the end of the show, I developed a reverence for Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as actors. 

In my opinion this show is a modern retelling of the book of Job but in this case the suffering inflicts a breaking point on the protagonist and it is thought-provoking when Walter White describes this as being "awake". This makes me wonder if everyone has a context where they would "break bad" and I don't necessarily mean break the law but their own ethos.
