Many of you think Breaking Bad a dark comedy.

I, however, find nothing comedic about the nihilism of drug addiction beyond De Quincy. I saw enough of that in the Sixties, and it wasn't not hilarious then.

Neither do I consider the breakup of the family to be humorous. The absolute amorality of a man destroying other people to profit his own family is incomprehensible to me.

The wanton, pornographically lingering brutality, too, fails to elicit chuckles from me, what with the sundry decapitations, sliced carotid arteries, exploding heads, dissolution in various industrial chemicals, etc., ad nauseam.

As much as I enjoy the writing, acting, cinematography, plotting, and especially characterization of this series, I do so despite the brutalizing effect it has on viewers.

Perhaps I'm an anachronism, for I consider it a cautionary tale rather than a comedy of any shade.
