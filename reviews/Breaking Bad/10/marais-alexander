This, coupled with American Horror Story, Justified, True Blood, and The Killing is a prime example of quality television. Bryan Cranston is EXCELLENT as Walter White, and he's excellent because you don't think "he's such a good actor" you're thinking "that guy is f****ed up." Dean Norris is a good, obnoxious brother-in-law who gets in some hot water, and then some. Anna Gunn turns in a solid performance. Everyone else is solid too, but what stands out is the setting and cinematography. The deserty plains of Alburque, New Mexico are a gorgeous backdrop to such a bloody and gruesome story. The story itself is nothing new, but handled with a gritty style. Danny Trejo guest stars in a memorable episode and meets a memorable end. This is not the *best* show, it is *one* of the best. 10/10. Good solid work.
