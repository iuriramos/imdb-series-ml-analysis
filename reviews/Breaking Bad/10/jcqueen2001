*SPOILER ALERT* Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston as Walter White, a chemistry teacher with terminal lung cancer who, in order to afford chemo therapy and to care for the child that he has on the way, cooks and distributes crystal meth. If you didn't understand from that first sentence, understand from this sentence that this is not a show that is meant for kids. This show deals with obviously the drug industry, violence, prostitution and much more. But for those who know about all these things, Breaking Bad may just be for you. With Bryan Cranston as the lead and Aaron Paul beside him as Jesse Pinkman, a junkie who helps White to sell the meth, it's the recipe for the perfect drama. Cranston and Aaron both put energy into their characters, them ALONE are enough to watch this show. Even the side characters are amazingly interesting. And the plot is one of the best parts of the show. If you've missed the series while it was on AMC like I did, get on Netflix and binge watch it. Breaking Bad is my absolute favorite show it will not disappoint drama lovers. I give AMC's Breaking Bad the highest score I can give a 10/10.
