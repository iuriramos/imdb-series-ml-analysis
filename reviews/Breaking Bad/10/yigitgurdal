If I'm going to write a review on IMDb it has to be about Breaking Bad.My favorite TV Series.If you want a TV Series going to change your life style you have to watch Breaking Bad.What can i say... First season is go very well.Second is quite slow but not boring.And when the Season 3 come it's make you feel what i said on the first place.The other seasons follow the 3.I wish it didn't end.Because i didn't like the end.It has to ended but not like that.I don't know maybe happy ending going to be more cool.But I'm not judging.I only say end might be more happy then that.This is it all my words.I hope you enjoyed my review.This is my first so sorry if i bored you.
