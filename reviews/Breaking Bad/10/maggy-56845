This show is absolutely amazing. Everything about it: the acting, the characters, the writing, the plot...it's all there! This show doesn't fall short at any moment and keeps the audience always wondering. I love it! It is not action packed in the explosive and life and death type way 24/7. No, this show takes time to develop everything. Everything has a reason, and they actually make sense. It is still action packed, but in a different way.

The acting is on point in almost every scene. They bring the characters to life, and they portray the characters how the writers probably want them to be portrayed. I loved every character, even if I disapproved of their actions. Moreover, I sympathized with them, got mad at them, was screaming (inside my head) at them.

This show is an art. I don't know if I could express how much of a treasure it is. I read somewhere that someone said something along the lines of : "I am envious of the people who haven't watched this show because they have the opportunity to watch this brand new." That statement is gold. Could not be more true. This show is life, and definitely my favorite show.
