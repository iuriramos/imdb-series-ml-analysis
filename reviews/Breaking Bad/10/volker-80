Quite recently I have heard / read about this series critically acclaimed success from friends and newspapers. Therefore I've started watching all 62 episodes within a week in long night sessions. This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better! Let me honestly say I've got addicted a few seconds after i've started with the pilot episode. This wasn't a series for me anymore but also a long thrilling movie I couldn't turned off. Perfect story, plots, characters, actors and actresses, filming locations, ... The story is brutal and comedic at the same time. The soundtrack rocks! Creator Vince Gilligan is truly a genius! 

BREAKING BAD will set the high standard for a long, long time.
