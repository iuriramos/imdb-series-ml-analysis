Often at times the standard of writing and acting in TV series can be sub par, however from the the initial synopsis you can tell this was a thought provoking labor of love. And if this series was going to everything the writer and director hoped it would be, it would needed everyone to be on there game and Bryan Cranston was from start to finish. In my option Aaron Paul grew as an actor as did his character throughout the show and the relationship between the two of them really took you through all the emotions possible. I am sure you will have heard a lot about this series and it's never really advised to believe the hype and more take the journey and judge for yourself and enjoy.
