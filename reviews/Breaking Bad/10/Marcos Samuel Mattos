The best series of all time, almost with no negatives, almost PERFECT!!! The first season was good, well represented what was upcoming to the viewers. The second season was simply amazing to the point that I would never imagine that would be better. Then came the third season, better and stronger than the second, mostly due to the Cousins presence, and Hank's evolution, allied to the amazing Gus Fring. Then four season perplexed me with the first episode "Box Cutter" and as well the last, "End Times". To end, the fifth season was perfect, no negative points, it was completely perfect, Todd's presence and development, as well the Jack's White Supremacy Gang and Lydia was the strongest points of the season, developing a plot better and better with Hank, Jesse and Mr White. The episodes "Gliding Over All", "To'Hajiilee", "Ozymandias", "Granite State" and "Felina" proved that Breaking Bad was the best series of all time.
