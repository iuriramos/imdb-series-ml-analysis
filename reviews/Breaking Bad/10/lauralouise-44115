Breaking Bad is a show that stays with you for a long time even after you finished all the seasons. It is brilliant writing, acting and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. 

I must admit my first shot at watching BB did not go well. I found the first episodes quite boring and didn't feel that interested in watching any more. Months later I decided to give it another try and I'm so glad I did. This is one of those shows that you can watch 5 episodes in an evening and feel like you can't wait for the next night to watch some more. 

I have watched BB all the way through twice. Once on my own and once again with my partner who I persuaded to watch it with me. He is very fussy when it comes to TV shows and does not get drawn into them easily but, like me, he was hooked on this. 

Like any other TV series BB does have its boring parts but this more than makes up for it with the rest of the show.
