This is an amazing TV series as it is a package : crime,drama,emotions,brains, in short WOW. Walter White is a super intelligent chem teacher who has lived a simple life and has done nothing wrong EVER.Then one day he is diagnosed of lung cancer and he breaks bad.He wants to leave money for his family so he partner up with a former student of his i.e. Jesse Pinkman n cooks meth, which is like the purest anybody have ever seen. In their journey of cooking and selling, they come across extreme situations but always finds a way to snap out of it. Walt's split personality is the X-factor as we never expect a normal guy turn into a high class criminal. It's definitely not for everybody, people who like crime based shows and admire some serious acting will love it. I haven't finished it but the suspense is awesome, the best part is the first scene of every episode, it just makes you wanna not miss any minute of the rest of the episode. You feel attached to the characters not because you are sympathetic but they are actually lovable. Superb acting by Bryan Cranston and that is not at all doubtful but Aoron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is so cute and totally fits in this role. Even if you are not a TV series kinda person, trust me you'll complete this one.It's as addictive as the blue meth of heisenberg ;).
