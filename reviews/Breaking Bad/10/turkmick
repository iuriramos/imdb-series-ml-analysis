This show is absolutely outstanding! It's quickly become one of my all time favorites, I only remember Bryan Cranston from Malcolm in the middle and am fairly shocked by how different he is. He goes from being a completely convincing suburbanite teacher to a completely believable villain without betraying the character. At times he looks completely menacing which is probably what makes the show work because his character really isn't that way. 

It's actually a rush at times watching the show because he's so good at sucking you into the world. There's no point in reading reviews for this show, just start watching it, you won't be able to stop.
