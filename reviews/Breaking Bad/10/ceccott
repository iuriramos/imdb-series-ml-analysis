I could write a ridiculously long review explaining the ins and outs of this series. Telling you all what makes it so good and evaluating each character and each episode with incredible detail, but I'm not going to do that.

What I'm going to do instead, is tell you that I love TV and film. I've watched thousands of different films and I have watched many, many TV series too. So when I say that Breaking Bad is, by an absolute mile, the greatest thing I have ever watched, I want you to take that very seriously. I have spent the past hour or so trying to think of one single flaw, one single bad thing about Breaking Bad and I cannot think of anything. I cannot explain to you how fantastic this series is, in every way imaginable. The acting, the camera-work, the soundtracks, the scripting, the makeup, everything.

I am a hard guy to please in terms of TV and film, and I'm not just saying that, I truly am. I always manage to find at least one negative point in everything, at least one thing where a film or series can improve, but Breaking Bad is as close to perfection as you are ever going to see. If you haven't watched it for whatever reason, I beg you, please watch this series. Ignore all the people who say it is "overrated" or "boring", because they really are clueless, or just looking to cause an argument.

Please, please, please watch Breaking Bad. I cannot put into words how amazing it is. There aren't enough adjectives in the English language to describe it. It is simply, perfect.
