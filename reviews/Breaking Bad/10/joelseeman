a couple of days ago i started watching breaking bad not my kind of show i thought but i tried it and i can't stop bryan cranston is incredible one of the greatest actors i've seen in a while even if you don't think you would like this show believe me when i say you will and not only bryan cranston but his supporting actor aaron paul who i grew up on in movies such as ''whatever it takes'' ''van wilder'' and ''big love'' he evens the playing field on this show a truly great cast and script drives this show and i'm only half way through the second season. so believe me when i say this is a show that every single episode takes you somewhere new a makes you watch every episode from start to finish.
