10/10 FORSURE! Usually there isn't much you can say about a TV show. Usually it sucks or it's great. But with Breaking Bad, there isn't much you can't say. It's absolutely 100% brilliance. For viewers out there who have never seen an episode of Breaking Bad, be prepared to sit at the edge of your seat throughout the entire 5 seasons. Forsure, there are a lot of TV shows out there, and some too alike. But when watching Breaking Bad, it's a whole new experience. It's almost like it's not even TV its just a really long movie or a real life experience; re told..with a lot more excitement. There is no proper classification for it's genre. Nor is it a drama or a comedy or even a thriller. It's just Breaking Bad. The creators and directors completely broke bad, and changed our entire way of watching TV. 

Every person on this earth should have the opportunity to watch Breaking Bad. I am a regular IMDb fan and user, and daily check the ratings of my favorite shows. Breaking Bad being my favorite show, I am always glad to see that it maintains such a good average of 9.4/10. That is phenomenal! Even more glad am I too see that it had spiked to 9.5/10, which is even better! It deserves that...and more! Right now, Breaking Bad is tied with Planet Earth, both at 9.5/10. I hope to see one day, Breaking Bad reach the score of 9.6. It deserves it 100%. 

I watch a lot of TV, not because I'm lazy, but because it's so intriguing and I love reviewing and rating the shows. With that said:

Without a doubt, Breaking Bad is the best show ever created.

Thanks to all the producers and directors and especially Vince Gilligan for creating Breaking Bad. Walter White and his fanatic undertaking of the meth industry, will forever be in our hearts!!

10/10 Any day of the week!

HEISENBERG FOR THE WIN!
