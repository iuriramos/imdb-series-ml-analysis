This may be one of the best shows on TV I have seen. This show was excellent. The acting, the story, the characters, all masterfully done. 

From the start we know this story is going to be a tragedy. An underachieving genius with a terminal illness decides to start down a dark path as means to better provide for his family. Or is that the excuse he tells himself? As Walt dives further into the darkness, the dangers grow, as does the evil within him until he simply embraces his alter ego. Dr. Jekyll unable to control Mr. Hyde (or simply not wanting to). He goes from being Walt, to embracing Heisenberg (You know my name).

The show also managed to do, what very few shows are able to, and that is ending when it was time. Far too many times a show doesn't know when to stop, and starts to get stale, or jumps the shark as they say. Not here. While the end is predictable, and Walt's fate known from very early in the show, it is still satisfying to watch unfold.
