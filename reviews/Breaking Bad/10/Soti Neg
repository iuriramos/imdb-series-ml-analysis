Truly a fantastic show with an epic build up. It's definitively one of the best shows to exist. Everything about this show is great. The build up of each character is fantastic. Vince Gilligan truly made a work of art. It's a show that everyone should experience. It has everything you could possibly want from a show. It has it's funny moments, it has drama and the epic violent moments that keep you watching. Every detail in the show is important and all the cliffhangers are totally worth it. The acting is fantastic and the plot is great. You really get to know and feel for the characters. Everyone did a fantastic job on this show and I'm definitely glad that I got to experience such a brilliant show.
