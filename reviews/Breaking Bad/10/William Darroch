Breaking Bad... 

For me it sets the bar so high that no Game of thrones or dexter comes close to it, they may call there self the "competition" The bar is out of sight though. 

Breaking bad runs through the life of Walter White and his "sidekick" Jesse Pinkman, it takes us through turmoil and trauma to get to our end which has to mines and many others opinions has been the best way to go out, not just a bang an ever lasting mark on television history. 

For anyone who hasn't seen this go watch this. Give yourself an early gift and watch the best ever show broadcast on TV.
