Breaking Bad is so far a tremendous work of art, a show that truly could have gone anywhere from the brilliant pilot episode. Bryan Cranston has finally been able to prove what a brilliant actor he is with the character of Walter White and the unbelievable journey through the downward spiral he has taken us, and in my opinion, what a joy it has been to sit shotgun to show creator Vince Gilligan's crazy vision of the most messed up midlife crisis I have ever seen. Each episode seems to always throw more fire into the flames as the journey becomes more dangerous by the minute. Mr White reminds me of a teacher I had in high school, someone I always expected lived a very boring and routine life, not ever any real danger to it. But after watching Walter whites journey so far, who knows, maybe my teacher was a me-th cook as well.
