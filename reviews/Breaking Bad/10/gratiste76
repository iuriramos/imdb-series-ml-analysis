Near the very end of this TV show, it is not hard to conclude that this is for sure the best crime drama series ever made for TV. There is however few more, but as a real life drama it is the best. Other memorable and legendary TV shows is for sure "The Sopranos", but it is more oriented on fictional mafia style. The storyline of Breaking Bad which is very unpredictable, yet follows very clear path of ordinary man entering dark side of the crime, and the consequences that comes with it feels real and unusual for TV show. The photography of the sceneries, the time lapse in scenes are unique, as well is more than few times camera work in unusual way. The score tempo and sound of it brings tense and is in the great rhythm with the plot, all the way through series (especially season 4). Soundtrack here is less important, but the rhythm of the scores, which is unbeatable is creepy and unique. Everything looks more like high quality movie than TV show. Actors brings excellent acting, and are very involving. So much can be said, so much more, but in short, this is the one great TV show that is worth to have in own collection. What is interesting, the series did not fall down going through seasons, but becomes better. Fort me personally seasons 3, 4 & 5 looks the best. Making reruns is not boring but something very interesting to discover what we might miss in vast of details this series brings, and it is fun to re watch how this shy ordinary man becomes dangerous villain.
