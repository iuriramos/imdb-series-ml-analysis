Breaking Bad is without a doubt my favourite TV show of all time! You simply cannot beat Vince Gilligan when it comes to directing, you cannot beat Bryan Cranston with his outstanding acting skills and you definitely cannot beat Aaron Paul's mind-blowing character Jesse Pinkman. The detail that Vince Gilligan went into with Breaking Bad proves he is one of the worlds most talented directors. For example the similarity between Gustavo Fring having his face blown off in the episode comically named "Face Off" to the iconic teddy bear missing an eye in the episode "ABQ". Overall I would definitely recommend Breaking Bad to every single human.
