I certainly couldn't describe to anybody what Breaking Bad has meant to me. This show has made me laugh, made me cry, made me afraid, like no other show ever has. This is absolutely AMC's finest work. Now that it's over, I have got no clue what show I'll go to next.

I've got a ton of options: American Horror Story, Hell on Wheels, Dexter, Under The Dome, True Blood, The Bridge, The Killing, or Sons of Anarchy. I'm currently watching AMC's The Walking Dead, Low Winter Sun, and HBO's Game of Thrones. But I feel like I'm just replacing Breaking Bad, which is almost impossible. 

The only reason I even watched this show was because season 3 of The Walking Dead had just ended. I needed another show to hold me off until season 4. I skimmed through Netflix and stumbled upon Breaking Bad, which got really great reviews. As it turns out, I liked Breaking Bad just a bit more than Walking Dead.

I watched season 1 just to see how it was. I loved it, so I watched season 2. I kept watching and watching and watching. I realized I was addicted/hooked when I watched all of season 3 in one day. 

When season 5B started, I watched it every Sunday night. And now it's over. I have decided that Breaking Bad is the best show I've ever seen in my life. The final episode of the series was so gripping, so dramatic, almost painful to watch.

I truly recommend Breaking Bad to everybody who enjoys a good TV show.
