i got a bbm from a cousin in USA who was so hooked on the show that she just had to get the word out to all her friends to watch it. I take word of mouth advise seriously so i bought the dvds and OH MY GOD. The show is brilliant, so well written that u wonder what kind of magical brains do the writing. Its funny, the characters are flawed but intelligent, funny but edge-of-the-seat serious. This is a show where there is violence but it also shows the value of a human life like i have never witnessed. This show is a bundle of contradictions that will hook u from the very first episode. I passed the flag my sister passed me and recommended this show on facebook, twitter, bbm and what have you. And its OK if u call in sick because u cant stop watching it till 6 AM.
