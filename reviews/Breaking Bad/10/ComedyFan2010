I have never seen a show that I loved so much from the start until the very end. It never went down in quality, actually I feel it become even better in later seasons. And while not everything that was happening was what I liked, I still thought that it was done brilliantly. I am just sad it is over, I could go on watching it longer.

Created by Vince Gilligan, the show goes about a chemistry teacher Walter White who gets cancer and tries to make money for his family by getting together with his old student Jesse Pinkman and cook meth. The relationship between the two is one of my favorite parts of the show. They have such a great dynamics, so much chemistry (no pun intended) and seeing their friendship develop going through bumps etc. was beautiful.

All acting on the show is A class. Just as characters. So many different people very complex and greatly performed by the actors. This doesn't just go to the characters I loved, but even the ones who I didn't like, such as Walt's whole family. Their performances made the shows as great as it is just like the plot did.

And I must say, I found out some spoilers ahead of time. But watching the moments was still very intense and sort of unexpected. This shows how well it is done. The show is not only unpredictable because of "what happens" but also because of "how". Watch it! This is the best show of our time,impossible to not enjoy it and it will be a classic. I will try to follow the work of the creator and the actors from now on.
