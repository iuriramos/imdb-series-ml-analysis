Growth. Decay. Transformation. This is the foundation on which the show built it's own empire. The tale of an ordinary man and his death sentence. From the beginning, it is clear that the protagonist you're watching won't have a happy ending. Viewers were just not sure how severe on the spectrum that judgment would fall. However, as much as the show is praised for it's unique story telling, characters, and acting, the real prize for fans is in the details. Breaking Bad's success is fueled by its re-watch-ability as viewers will continue to find countless connections and theories. Although most of these are a product of over analyzing, there is still enough to make you question legitimately whether these clues were on purpose. I give it a perfect score. There are hundreds of reviews that do the same. You have to agree with the rest of us, it just feels so good to be bad.
