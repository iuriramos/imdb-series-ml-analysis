I cannot give this show enough praise. I have seen a lot of TV shows including the Sopranos, Game Of Thrones, The Wire, Mad Men etc and none of them compare to Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is a work of art. Intelligently written and amazingly well acted. Even two years after Breaking Bad ended, it is still hands down the best show I've ever seen in my life and I don't think anything will surpass in my lifetime. Every time I rewatch this phenomenal series I always discover something new and pick up on things that I missed before. Each season only gets better and better. The characters are also amazing and complex. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are the two standouts as they give the best performances that I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing on television. The on screen chemistry between these two actors is unreal. The Walt and Jesse relationship is the heart and soul of Breaking Bad.Anna Gunn,Dean Norris, Johnathan Banks, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odenkirk,Betsy Brant and RJ Mitte are also incredible on this show. Vince Gilligan your a genius. Thank you for giving us this outstanding work of art that will surely stand the test of time. Another thanks to all the outstanding cast and writers and directors for the success of this show. Trust me when I say that Breaking Bad really deserves all the hype it gets. I would give it more than a 10/10 if I could because this show deserves that and so much more. Seriously, if you haven't seen it yet then WATCH IT NOW!!!!! You won't be disappointed.
