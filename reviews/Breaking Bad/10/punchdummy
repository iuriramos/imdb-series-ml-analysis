This show is awesome!! I was blown away immediately. Who would have thought that Bryan Cranston had that kind of force? The characters on Breaking Bad are rich with life. Every character on the show has a humanity about them that just drags you into the unfolding drama. The only character I don't like is Skylar. With all the drug dealers, thieves, and macho tough guys it's hard to believe that she would come across as the most ungrateful, callous, and cold hearted person on the show. Her character should be killed off the show. Bryan Cranston is outstanding and the supporting cast are superb. AMC has stepped up the game for all shows. I can't stop watching. This show rocks!!
