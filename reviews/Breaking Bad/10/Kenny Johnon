This series is inevitably the greatest Television entertainment that cable has to offer. The plot line is so creative you don't know what the next episode will be about. With Bryan Cranston's amazing acting ability and character, this show is incomparable and can never be recreated due to the amazing work of Vince Gilligan and his team. The dramatic affect left at the end of each episode makes you crave with wonder. The episodes show so much strength and power that the next plot line would never be thought of by the most extreme "televisionaholic" and/or critic. Each episode has a certain meaning and leaves you guessing what will happen on next week's episode. There has been rumor of the series opening a third season in March of 2010, I advise you to watch the other two seasons before starting to watch the new season because, you will be very lost. But with the time brought into watching the seasons you will be absolutely satisfied and there will not be one doubt in your mind that what you had watched was a waste of time. This is an absolute epic show! Watch it! You will be glad!
