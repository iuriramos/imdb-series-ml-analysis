Breaking Bad, on the surface, seems to be a marketable and typical show following the usual premise of a middle class American leading a double life- one for good, and one for evil- in the wake of other great shows like the Sopranos, Dexter, Weeds, etc.

However, what starts off as an enjoyable drama evolves into a beautifully crafted tale- the stuff of a complex modern Shakespearian tragedy. Breaking Bad is more than just a television show. It is a work of art. The acting is mostly impeccable, and the writing and dialogue is original and profound. On top of it all, the directing style seems to have evolved and improved throughout the series. Nearly every shot is a masterpiece of its own.

So if you are looking for an original series, which will not only kill a couple of hours, but also leave you seeing the world in a different way- finding story in every small instance around you- this is the show for you
