"Breaking Bad" is one poignant, riveting, 60-hour long story of a single man's desperation. If you can make it past the first four episodes...you will simply find it addictive and hard to stop watching, once you understand the story's general premise. In fact, you'll have a marathon Netflix watching party, to the very end. 

The acting and storyline is written and executed with meticulous precision and relevant accuracy. This is closer to reality, than ANY staged "reality show" currently on TV. If you ever wanted to know what the destructive effects of Methamphetamine is....."Breaking Bad" will send you on a one-way journey to Hell. There is NO return. The wake of death and destruction of everybody involved is so completely represented with this series. I cannot begin to conceive ways it could be depicted any more vividly. 

Watch "Breaking Bad" with a clear, open mind and realize there is no "religious" destination known as Hell - it's made by man....
