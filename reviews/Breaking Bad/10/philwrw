Watch it and you will be hooked. Missed the first three episodes thinking why they would use Bryan Cranston from Malcom, but I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE. BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Home BORED 1 night and AMC ran a marathon of Breaking Bad, so I thought I would check out the three episodes I missed. Ever since then, never missed an episode and been a loyal fan. One of five shows I truly love and will miss. Can not believe ending after season five. The show is truly unique and nothing will ever come close to its originality. Bryan Cranston and everyone involved with the shows deserves the up-most-respect. Will truly miss this show, but a show this great should not be dragged out, because someone or something will ruin it.
