This programme defines binge watching. I was immediately hooked by the unique premise of this show. Mesmerised by the superb acting of the ensemble cast. The script has everything. Walter White, a normal science teacher, with a normal home life. Suddenly, his world is turned upside down at the discovery of having terminal cancer. He has poor health insurance, so how is he going to afford to foot the enormous treatment bill? What ensues is an unpredictable sequence of events. It is this unpredictability that makes this show compelling. Things really get interesting (and comedic) with the introduction of Saul Goodman and his resourceful ex-cop accomplice, Mike. I binge watched all 5 seasons within 2 weeks. Then, a year later, I did it all over again. That is the first time I've ever done that. Why? It's because this really is that good a show. I wanted to relive every moment of the superb acting. Watching that final episode was tear jerking...the end of the most compelling drama series I have ever had the fortune to watch. Thank you Vince Gilligan, you are a genius!
