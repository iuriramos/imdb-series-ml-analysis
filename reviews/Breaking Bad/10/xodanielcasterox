I have never seen a show so dark, so violent, so brutally realistic and become so invested that I can't get enough of it. Nothing like this. Screw Malcolm in the Middle, this is Brian Cranston's true performance of a lifetime. He delivered such emotion worth receiving a dozen Oscars. And his transformation really is unbelievably stunning swinging from nerdy chemistry teacher to daring and threatening criminal, but he still sympathetic and human. A lot of us may disagree with some of the choices he makes as the world's greatest meth cook but at least we understand why he's doing it, which makes us think to ourselves: what would you do if you had no money to support your family and you have no medical insurance for your lung cancer, which is what he's got? What choice would you be making in situations like this? I think that's the moral of this story: consequences, sacrifices, and most of all 'choice'. It makes you think of what path to take to support your family if there were no other alternatives. I think about a lot.

Everything works: the story, the tone, the timing, the casting, and the chief of it's success, the acting. Not once does it feel like somebody's winking at the camera, everybody is firmly focused. It's a great show with a great lesson: choice.
