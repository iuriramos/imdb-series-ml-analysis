Yes a bold statement, but trust me I have watched loads of TV shows over the years.

Sopranos, Six feet Under, The Wire, The Shield, BSG, Game of Thrones, you know where I'm going. 

Great TV shows all of them, but BB is the show that tops them all. The characters from season 1 to Season 5.2 change and develop so much, more than any show I've watched in the past. 

And if you love cliff hanger endings, it seems every episode ends on one.

You've never seen anything like it in your life. An utterly amazing piece of work that has left a massive hole in my life.

You need BB in your life, that's all I'm saying.

PS. One crumb of comfort, Gus is in Revolution!!
