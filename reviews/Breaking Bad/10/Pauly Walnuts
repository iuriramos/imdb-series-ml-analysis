I'm going to keep this short and concise.. Breaking Bad is the epitome of perfection, a radiant show with just about no flaws. Bryan Cranston's portrayal and development of Walter White is phenomenal; Aaron Paul's performance - impeccable. Some of the other stars of the show aren't as amazing as these two, but they manage to sync into their roles throughout the seasons. The chemistry of the actors in the series is beyond realism, and so this series earns a definite 10 star vote. 

The only thing I am afraid of, is that no other series will ever quite keep me on the edge of my seat as Breaking Bad. I will be highly disappointed when this show ends. That is all.
