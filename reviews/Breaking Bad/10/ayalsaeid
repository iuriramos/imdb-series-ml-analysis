yes, it's time to judge my book from it's cover as i've said, there is no show can be better than BREAKING BAD it's the BEST OF THE BEST and i loved it a lot Bryan Cranston & Aaron Paul presents a very beautiful characters and shows us the variety of all personalities from being happy, anger, High, and much more the story is very attractive people, charisma, everything in the show is so adorable and must be loved, scenes, crimes and the music inside are very mysterious and positive to grab your attention to get in the mood and watch all the series in a week without any interruption from anybody even if it's from your work, can't write about the show because if i want to do it then i must have at least a million lines to express the show
