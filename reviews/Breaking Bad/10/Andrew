Breaking Bad is a work of genius - I realize that is a word thrown around somewhat haphazardly at times, but this show truly is brilliant in my view. The cinematography is beautiful and often ingenuous, the acting fantastic, the storyline and subplots enthralling and the soundtrack cleverly chosen to the point where it becomes an integral, organic part of the show. As an example, David Costabile's (Gale) singing with the record player as he attends his domestic duties is delightfully integrated - a scene I happily admit to have watched and listened to several times. 

It has been said a lot (and duly acknowledged by awards) already how great the acting is in this show, but it won't hurt to say it again: Bryan Cranston is a joy to watch as Walter White, whose increasingly polar double life is mesmerizing to follow as it evolves throughout the series. Aaron Paul is also spectacular as Jesse Pinkman and complements Walter White in a way that approaches yin-and-yang like qualities. Dean Norris, Anna Gunn, RJ Mitte and Betsy Brandt are also truly praiseworthy; Dean Norris' part as Hank Schrader gives a particularly stunning performance in my view as he develops into a complex and vulnerable character who feels the need to hide his increasing frustration and sense of alienation from his wife and colleagues. A great actor. Giancarlo Esposito, another actor well worth mentioning, is perfect as the enigmatic Gus. 

This is a show that works on is own terms - it is brave (lung cancer, rampant drug abuse, methamphetamine manufacture and distribution - hardly easy content to pitch at any network) and balances perfectly between the darkly sinister and the absurdly comical in my opinion. It is a show that grows with every episode. 

Highly recommended!
