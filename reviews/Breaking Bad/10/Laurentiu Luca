Breaking Bad is not just a TV show. It is a masterpiece. 62 episodes of pure and intense drama, epic moments and incredible performances. Walter White, Jesse Pinkman...these 2 names will remain forever in our hearts. A regular chemistry teacher to turn into a drug dealer? Who believed that this is the premise for the greatest adventure? From the first to the last episode you can not predict what will happen next time. Is so unpredictable and you will enjoy it. This is the best you can see on TV. It clearly deserves the title of "the best show ever made". 

Breaking Bad is the one who knocks!
