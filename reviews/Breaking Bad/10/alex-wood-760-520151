I have just finished Breaking bad and I feel like I've been on a roller coaster. I was recommended by a friend to see it and after a lot of critical acclaim I decided to give it a go, the gamble paid off. Breaking Bad exceeded my expectations and is one the best thing I have watched in a long time. If by any chance you are reading this then I would encourage to watch it as it is one of the best things to come out of Hollywood/studios in nearly ten years. This is a programme that will be remembered in fifty years, yes it's that good. I warn you though that season 4 can be a bit dreary at the start but the rest of the series pays off for this part as well as series 5 which is a masterpiece. It may have finished and the hype may have died down but I urge you to watch it as you will not regret it, trust me.I hope I could have played a small part to you the reader in persuading you to watch this, thank me later
