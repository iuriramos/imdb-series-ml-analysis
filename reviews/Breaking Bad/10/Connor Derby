Action packed. Suspenseful. Great story and great characters. One of those shows that I'm just hooked to. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are both stellar actors and play their roles very well. Also has solid antagonists, and an original story. If you haven't read the summary yet, the show is about a high school chemistry teacher, Walter White (Bryan Cranston) who teams together with his failed junkie student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to make crystal methamphetamine. He has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and he wants to make sure that his family is set after he is gone, with the meth money. Yet Walter, being the chemistry teacher, ends up making some of the highest quality crystal meth out there. Yet their involvement in the business makes things a bit complicated when they meet the antagonists of the show. Awesome series. Love it.
