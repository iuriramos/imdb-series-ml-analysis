I took me a long time to jump on the Breaking Bad hype; I had tried it about a year ago and did not get past episode one. I thought it was slow and boring. However, after all the talk on the internet (imgur, reddit etc) I gave it another try. It is very hard for me to put into words how I feel about this show. Yes, the first series is slow and the action is sparse; but that is life I guess. The writers are trying to tell a real life story about an ordinary person turning to crime.

As the series go by, The action picks up speed and more and more you find yourself on the edge of your seat. I am not one to shout at my TV, but I found myself so often screaming at the TV in sheer amazement. This show draws you in; it emotionally hooks you up to the characters and you are on this ride with them.

Now that it has finished (And just to mention, BB, unlike *many* other TV shows, triumphs with it's ending) I am in two minds. I would absolutely love it to carry on, but I am also glad it finished. There are some shows that just have to finish, and others that just carry on for the sake of making money. BB had it's time and knew when it was done. It was not drug out, it wrapped itself up neatly and put itself on the shelf.
