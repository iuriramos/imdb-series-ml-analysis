I'm not one to get all melodramatic over a television show, I can't stand people who do it, but this show seriously cannot be rated high enough. The brilliant mix of A-grade acting, top-notch writing, suspense, humour, twists, photography and soundtrack is something that will keep fans of any genre entertained.

The change that comes over Walt's face when he turns from mild-mannered chemistry teacher to Heisenberg, the all-conquering drug manufacturing king-pin is remarkable when accompanied by that little head-tilt. You want to see a drug-manufacturer lose, but you want Walt to win.

I could go on about the show, but nothing I say could do it justice. Just watch it, there is literally no way you will regret it.
