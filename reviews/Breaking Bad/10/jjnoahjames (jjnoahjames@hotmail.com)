Breaking Bad "cooks" like a great show. Cooking is a term you will come to know from Breaking Bad. The main character played by Bryan Cranston (Malcom in the Middle, Clerks) is amazing as Walter White. Bryan pulls off his dynamic character well.

This show is emotionally engaging on a large scale. It entertains jocks, nerds, gangstas, lovers and loners.

The most intriguing thing about this show is the script. It's explosive but to make it even better the cinematography shines bright! The beauty of the Mexico bordered south is jaw dropping here. 

None of us can grasp what they have went through to make this show, on such a low budget and such low viewer ship. The producers, actors, and directors, and more poured their blood, sweat, and tears into making this show I'm sure.

Breaking Bad is as original as it is beautiful.
