This review is simply an opinion of how I perceive Breaking Bad. Others may not have the same thoughts, but someone out there must agree. I am a reviewer that is normally not interested in television shows in comparison to movies. This is how I feel about Breaking Bad. 

Breaking Bad is widely considered the greatest show on television. This would be a sufficient ranking if said before the latest seasons (4,5). This is not to say that the first 3 seasons were below par, but rather that adding season 4,5 to the mix puts the show on another level. Never have I suffered this much waiting between episode showings. Every episode has me on the edge of my seat, and leaves me wanting more and more. Knowing that the 5th season will be its last practically leaves me in tears. I know I am not the only one who feels this way, but I felt the need to write my first review ever about the show that got me interested in television again, and will forever be my personal favorite.
