I don't think there can be enough praise in the world that I can give to this show. It's nothing short of perfection. I started watching on Netflix about a week and half ago, and I've just finished all 5 seasons today. Yep, I've lost my job because of all the sickies I've been pulling since watching ;) It's like a good book you can't put down, you get so involved with the story and characters and you can't bear to put it down. The writing is superb and all the actors were brilliant. Cranston and Paul are two of the greatest actors I've ever seen, and their performances were worthy of every award nomination and win that they received. Same goes for the show in general. I haven't seen anything like it and I doubt I ever will again.

Honestly, do yourself a favor - watch this show. You'll be seeing something truly spectacular.
