All I heard for months was what a great series this show is and after watching pretty much the entire thing in the span of 3 weeks (I know, but it was winter break for my school and I love movies) I was not disappointed in the slightest. I rarely found anything wrong in the acting or script. Very minimal awkward moments.

The only thing I wish that didn't happen was that awkward lull in the middle of the series where it became kind of a "same sh*t different episode" although I have rarely found the series that can pull off not doing that.

Bryan Cranston has shown a side I always knew possible and I am just happy he found it. Him and Aaron Paul are phenomenal actors and I hope to see more of them thanks to this.

In short, it's definitely worth your time and if it wasn't for the fact that it's really long and I have things to do with my life I would sit down and watch it all over again. Watch it and love it and welcome to the club.
