I am a new member here. My summary says it all. Every facet of this series is top-notch. I know that meth is evil. Yet I'm rooting for Walt and Jessie to get away with it all and come out on top. Unlikely. I pray there is at least 5 worthwhile seasons. This is must-watch TV. But some may want to suspend some of their moral predispositions - at least for an hour/week. I have seen every episode twice. And some three times. Every viewing I have enjoyed more then the last. This entire cast is, well, magic. The highlight of the show for me is the intense interaction between Walt and Sky. There have been scenes over the three seasons that have been as riveting as anything in my favorite films. Breaking Bad, like (for me Six Feet Under) is a showcase of what television can be. Unlike Six Feet Under it has yet to slide, even briefly, into mediocrity.
