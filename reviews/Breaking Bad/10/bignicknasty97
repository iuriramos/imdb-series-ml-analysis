Breaking Bad is what I consider thee greatest show ever aired, while many would disagree they couldn't say it was anything less of incredible. The first scene, a man looking at what he's done scared and upset, to the last scene, with the grin and happiness he's long sought. While the show is very linear there are subplots they create and get rid of. The acting is 10/10 Emmy worthy, I love Malcolm in the Middle and all I can say is, wow. What a transformation. Cranston has always either captivated me or had me laughing in tears. Every character feels so necessary and needed to continue a great story. While Skylar can get annoying you can't help but feel for her. Walter Jr exaggerates his disease perfectly, and Jesse, ooh Jesse. This man sold me from the start that he would be amazing. Each character develops over time and I'd say he (a tad more than Walt) has the largest transformations. Before I watched Breaking Bad on Netflix I'd never seen any of these actors besides Cranston, and now I love all of em. Walt is a guy who you shouldn't root for but you do through the entire series, and when you don't believe me it's very short lived. Every action has a consequence, and the "answer man" as Mike says can either avoid them or fix them. From police to dealers to his partner. If you never seen this show and are hesitant to watch it. Sit down, get a drink and some popcorn, watch the entire first 7 episode season and see why this show is so highly praised.
