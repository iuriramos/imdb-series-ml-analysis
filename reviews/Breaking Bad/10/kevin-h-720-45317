This has got to be the best US TV series ever and considering some of its opposition that takes some beating.

The series tells of Chemistry teacher and genius Walter White who finding out he has cancer takes to manufacturing crystal meth so he can leave his wife and children well provided for in the event of his death.

WW soon finds himself immersed in the world of drugs, death and danger.The characterization of the protagonists in this series is nothing short of brilliant and no matter which character gets the chop there's another right behind who you will grow to love,admire, fear or hate, the series can have you laughing one minute, fearful the next or in absolute shock. this is a must see series and I can't find the words to big it up any more than saying MASTERPIECE....
