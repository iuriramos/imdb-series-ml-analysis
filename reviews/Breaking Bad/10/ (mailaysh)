Breaking Bad: One of AMC's most successful shows, Breaking Bad is thematically a work of art. A crucial factor in its success is the fresh angle on an anti-hero who is the main character. As an audience, it is fascinating to watch the unearthing of Walter's true personality. The TV show is a modern Macbeth: we see a man overcome by power and lust for his true love; it is a modern Jekyll and Hyde. Jekyll is Walter and Hyde is Heisenberg, the one who knocks. What made this show so brilliant for me was the non-traditional approach to shaping the main character: we are so used to having characters that go from bad past to redemption to good (hero's journey plot line). And yet, this show is also a love story: the love of an idea, the thrill of feeling powerful, and feared. It is a story of adventure: a man hiding in the shadows of suburban life steps into the harsh sun light of the American Southwest Desert. Duality of man, in terms of evil and good, is brought into a distinct sublime spotlight, where "good" as society sees it is questioned. The theme of personal satisfaction is carefully strung out and analyzed as Skyler, Walter, and Jesse all confront their inner demons while battling outer ones. Breaking Bad is a television classic that cannot be paralleled.
