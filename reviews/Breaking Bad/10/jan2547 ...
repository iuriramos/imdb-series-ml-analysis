First of all, I don't think people should compare this series with series like The Wire or The Sopranos. I've seen for example The Wire too but the only thing it has in common that it's about drugs. It's just like comparing apples with pears (a phrase we use in Belgium if people compare things that are nothing alike). The only thing you can say if you mention those two series is that their complementary. Were The Wire fixates more on the distribution, the police work and those things Breaking bad fixates more on the production of the matter. Where The Wire has no specific main character(s), Breaking Bad fixates on 2 main characters Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. 

Now enough with the comparison, I think I've made my point. Breaking bad is one of the best shows I've ever seen. Great acting by all of the cast. It's no wonder that Bryan Cranston has been nominated for the golden globe for best actor the last 3 years. He should have won it already! Also Aaron Paul is amazing and one of the best supporting actors in a show.

Breaking bad started of mind blowing! Just the pilot alone was maybe the best pilot I've ever seen. I think there are a lot of people who can agree with me on that. Just the concept was a lot of fun. The chemistry teacher who wants to make crystal meth just to make his life a little more exciting. 

After season one where Walter White is just starting up in his caravan it become's even more fun with the calm but fearless Gustavo Fring. For me, the most memorable scene from this series is the moment he comes out of Tio Salamanca's room with the right side of his face blown off. When he walks out with his usual look, straighten his jacket and just falls down. Really great scene. Just so i don't forget: Also an amazing acting performance from Giancarlo Esposito all the way.

I look forward to the last part of season 5 but i can't imagine that it would be disappointing. Just to end a last comparison with The Wire. I have to say I like them both very much, but I still find Breaking Bad to be better!
