I started watching BB in 2015, long after its finale after hearing about it and reading amazing reviews. Hooked from the pilot right till the very end, it was a breathtaking and memorable ride. The story of Walter White and his gradual turn to almost a complete madness of sorts was thrilling, emotional and scary at times. What started off as the story of a man with cancer trying to get enough money to support his family after his death by selling crystal meth(which in itself is a crazy plot), it turned out to be so much more. It is the single best TV show out there in my opinion and no episode can be called anything but excellent. With a perfect finale, this show has made a place in my heart, one that would be tough to fill. The characters are no-doubt engaging and help in making this show as brilliant as it is. Not one to miss out on.
