The story line make me to want more and more. I want to see every small detail form this TV series because the producer was extremely careful to details if you watch when you are disconnected from your daily concerns you will see all the evidence left by the characters some times you see something that will be an important clue in the investigation that the camera does not focus on it but is in a light that make you to remember the thing till finely it come and make a change in the life of Walter and Skyler White, Jesse Pinkman and Hank and Marie Schrader and the other characters. I'm still viewing the TV Show and I hope that the end will be as original as before and will not be a clich√© like the other movies and TV Shows I follow before. Thank you for reading my review and I strongly recommend this TV SHOW!
