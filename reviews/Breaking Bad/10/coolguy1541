Breaking bad is in my opinion the greatest TV show of all time, and I think it would be hard to deny it is one of the most neglected TV show in terms of TV ratings. The writing is unbelievable, the acting amazing with superb character development down to the minor players. My favorite character is Saul Goodman who isn't even in half the episodes, he's hilarious, almost everything thing he says cracks me up. It kills me that the show is not more well known than it is, I put it up there with the sopranos and the wire. It deserves so much credit as well because it is so original, the subject, characters, and story line. I just had to put pen to paper on this one, my man Bryan Cranston has done too good of job. Thank you so much for all your work!
