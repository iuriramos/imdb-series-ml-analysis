The first five minutes or so in the pilot episode did not have me very hopeful, but thankfully I kept watching because of the strong recommendations from friends and the exceptionally good reviews and awards it is noted for. The storyline, however brief is pretty much to the point. From that base, the writers have done an outstanding job. I liked that the cable broadcast domain does not restrict the writers and the producer from letting loose their creative juices; this series would never have seen the light of day in regular TV.

The very talented cast of actors was a delight to watch and a revelation in some instances. Watch the first season and you are hooked; the pun was too easy to resist. I have watched all four seasons and though I'm surprised there will be a fifth, I'm also thrilled and can't wait for it. There is so much going on, action, drama, some funny parts and the realism is its trademark now. If you haven't seen it, do; if you have and I assume you liked it of course, by all means recommend it to friends. They'll thank you for that.
