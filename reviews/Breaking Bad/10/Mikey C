The story and acting are incredible. I think we need a new word for what Aaron Paul does. It's so real it can't be "acting"! He has to be the best actor of our time. And Bryan Cranston and others: on the same level. Incredible. So sorry it's over. Still hoping they'll bring it back somehow as now I have nothing to watch (that compares). The way the story is mixed with action, you become part of it and it is so real at times that it can be hard to watch! An emotional roller coaster! To see the change in Walter White over time is insane. For me, I started out sympathizing a little but by the end of the series, I was ready for him to die (like most people in his life I think, including him). What a change and brilliant the way it was handled!
