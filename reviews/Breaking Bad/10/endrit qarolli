There is actually no way of describing breaking bad other than saying that it is brilliant.This is the story of a chemistry genius turned high school teacher who was diagnosed with lung cancer.Now you can see the story is really deep.And it gets deeper because Walter White (the main character) becomes a drug dealer and partners up with another drug dealer his ex student Jesse Pinkman. Walt has a handicapped son a daughter in the way and his wife doesn't work. So clearly he needs the money.He is not a bad man he just makes bad decisions. But after a while Walt loses sight of whats really important and why really entered the business in the first place.Now as much as you can think there is nothing brilliant about this show , but you're really wrong,because the writers develop this story into one of the most complex storyline you have ever seen. Also what i mostly love about breaking bad is that there is no bad character in this show such as there is no bad actor.From Bryan Cranston(Walter white) to Aaron Paul (jesse pinkman) who made two of the best performances in TV history and making one on the best duos of all time.But not just them all actors even guest actors.And every time the season end with some spectacular event that leaves you really waiting the next season. So what i am trying to say is that although this may not be the most addictive show you have ever seen this is worth a try , and believe me will thank me later.
