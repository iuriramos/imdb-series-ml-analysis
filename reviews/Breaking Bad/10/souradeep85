This show is berserk to say the least with excellent writing,top notch direction and an adept cast.Loved the pilot and the last episodes of season 4 and 5.Bryan Cranston can really bring the character of Walter White to life on so many levels along with Aaron Paul in case of Jesse Pinkman and it has been a joyride.I would rate this a 9.4 because even though it has some explosive and bombastic moments like when Walter kills Jack and his entire crew and also when Walter indirectly kills Gus Fring, it has some really boring episodes.I can think of the episode where the fly entered the methlab and a few others like that which were extremely boring.I also noticed that this show has very less music which makes situations boring at times BUT when it will blow your mind(and it will) you will understand why everyone loves this show.Adios.Bitch!!!
