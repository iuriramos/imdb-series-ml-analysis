I've seen many television shows, and almost of every worth while movie ever produced. In my opinion this is on of my top five favorite in either category. The story is captivating and will grip your attention throughout every minute(you won't be getting up for a drink). My favorite aspect of the series would have to be the acting witch is incredible. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal, and portrays his character to the letter. With the perfect combination of action, drama, and material thats makes you think this is by far one of the best television series to ever hit the air waves joining the likes of "The Sopranos" "OZ" "The Wire" and in my opinion "Dexter" witch is another superb series. What I find most incredible about it is they are able to create such a fantastic experience on cable T.V. without the freedoms of HBO and SHOWTIME. GREATTTTTT SHOW. WATCH IT!!!!!!
