The creativity of this series can not get better. To me it is like a Twin Peaks in it's complex nature of human psychology, but with a vastly different theme and mood. I like to watch it at night, when no one is around. I hate drugs, and most of Hollywood's products, but this show stands alone, great, gritty as it gets, unique, and poetic. A great job at plot tie ins', surreal moments, dark side of human nature, imagery. I feel dirty watching the shows at times, but a dirty I like, a dirty we all have in us but suppress, a dirty that howls at the moon and sometimes, cautiously, needs to be expressed.
