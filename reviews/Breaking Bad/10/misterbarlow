No review needed, just a short story to persuade you to watch!!

I am one of those lucky people who had never heard of this show during its run, so watched it all in one hit! A guy in work asked if I had seen it and said how amazing it was, which I pretty much ignored, however, within two weeks a further three people all said the same thing to me, "YOU MUST SEE THIS SHOW!"

So I downloaded the first few eps and the wife and I settled down. We were instantly hooked and watched several that night and i downloaded the lot the same night.. we literally watched the entire 62 episodes in about 10-12 nights watching 5 or 6 a night... she would come home from work and without even having tea and say "put another Breaking bad on"..

This was about a year ago, my dad recently heard of it and asked me to download it for him, and I watched ep1 again as a recap and that was that.. I re-watched the entire lot again in about 10-14 nights, as hooked as I was the first time round... 

My dad came round the other other night after having seen 4 or 5 eps of S01 and basically just said "WOW, I need more episodes of this asap...".... Basically if you have never seen it, go watch it!!
