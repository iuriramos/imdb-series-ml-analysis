3 Words to describe the show: Bitter. Sweet. Euphoria.

I haven't seen acting this good on a TV show. The filming is indescribable and the plot is so beautifully woven ...but it's so bad all at the same time. 

You don't watch this show, you experience it with the characters.

Sometimes I can't believe I'm rooting for a ex-chemistry teacher turned meth cooker...but then I remember the Walt I met in season 1; a cancer patient who just wants to provide family...even after he's gone. If there ever was a noble meth cook, Walter White would be on my list.

Watch the very first 3 episodes and I promise you won't want to stop. There's a reason why it's critically acclaimed as the best TV show of our generation. There's a reason why it's won so many awards. There's a reason why I'm not even a fan of TV in general but I'm glued to the screen.

Hidden under the laughable AMC network, this show is truly a diamond in the rough.
