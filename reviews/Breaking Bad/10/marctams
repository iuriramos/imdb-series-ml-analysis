Breaking Bad is the best show I've seen since The Wire.

The plot, characters and situations are fantastic. 

Bryan Cranston's portrayal of a man's descent into chaos and insanity is something I have never seen in a modern TV show.

The plots are carefully constructed and filled with action and tension.

The characters are lovingly realised and you care about every one, even the bad guys (of whom there are many). 

The only fault with the show is that it doesn't focus on the downside of crystal meth i.e. the people who actually use the stuff. Despite this Breaking Bad is still the most watchable thing on TV at the moment.

Watch it!
