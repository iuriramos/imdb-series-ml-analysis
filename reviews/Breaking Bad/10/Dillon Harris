Breaking Bad is a magnificent,outstanding and completely original television series that is filled with fantastic character development,action and an endless amount of highly intense and un-forgetful scenes .The series starts off fairly promising,and then as it continues it just gets better,over the course of five years,it never a goes downhill,and there isn't a single bad episode in the whole series.I think people were skeptical when the series first came around about the the dad from Malcolm in the Middle starring in a drama,but Bryan Cranston delivers an exhilarating performance in this,Walter White is nothing like Hal and thus proves that Cranston's range is amazing and he truly is a great actor,the change in Walter over the course of these five seasons proves that.But Cranston shouldn't have all the credit,no actor in this show comes across as unprofessional,but the outstanding actors have to be Anna Gunn,Aaron Paul,Dean Norris,RJ Mitte,Betsy Brandt,Bob Odenkirk,Jonathan Banks,Giancarlo Esposito,Charles Baker,Matt Jones,Jesse Plemons and Krysten Ritter are all some of the series best characters and incredible actors and they all deserve so much credit for making this's series so great,and of course,Vince Gilligan,for his incredible writing and directing skills,this show would be nothing without him.My favourite characters of the entire series are without a doubt Jesse and Mike,their personality are something that really appeals to me,and their development over the course of the series is very pleasing,I loved Walter as well,but I never felt like I could relate to him,not that I would want to.All in all,Breaking Bad is a fantastic series,it never disappoints and I would recommend it to everyone.

Walter White (Bryan Cranston),a highly intelligent high school professor,joins the crystal meth business using his amazing skills in science to create a high quality and addictive product,after he learns he has lung cancer and wants to make enough money for his family to use when he's gone.
