I absolutely loved this show! I have watched every season twice! I recommend this show to everyone! You will be hooked right away and find yourself wanting to watch episode after episode! Everything about this show is excellent! Bryan Cranston is sensational, his acting is one of the best performances I have ever seen! The character he plays, Walter White, becomes one of the greatest television show characters of all time! Even though Walter White does a lot of bad things, you will be rooting for him the entire time! Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse Pinkman, is Walter Whites partner in crime and you will love him and hate him equally! I had never heard of Aaron Paul until I watched this show and I was so impressed with how great his acting was! There are so many other great characters in this show that you will love! I do not want to give away any spoilers so take my word for it and go and watch every episode, this show is a must see!

I give Breaking Bad a 10 out of 10 Acting: A+ Story/Writing: A+ Characters: A+ Ending: A+
