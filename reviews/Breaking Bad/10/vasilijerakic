I don't watch crime series (I am Sci-Fi/Fantasy guy) that much, but I am simply amazed by this one, even more than I was with Sherlock. This show is full of mind-blowing (no pun intended) plot twists. The ending is perfect. The beginning is perfect. Everything is perfect, even that "Fly" episode. Vince is a genius, Bryan and Aaron are great! In my opinion, Season 4 was the best, but all seasons are fine. In Season 1 we get to see Walter White breaking bad with his student/friend. In Season 2 we get to see progress on streets with their product And on the very end we get to see them meet the protagonist, and later antagonist Gustavo Fring. And that's Season 3 and the big meth lab they work in, and a new partner that will eventually replace Walter. What does Walter do? Kills him. Or orders a kill. Heisenberg taking over. In Season 4 we get to see stuff with Gustavo twisting, until his death and another Heisenberg moment. People say Walter White dies in that episode. And Season 5 - the masterpice. Enjoyed every single minute of it. Recommended to EVERYONE!
