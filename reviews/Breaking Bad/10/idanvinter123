I may not have watched hundreds of TV shows, but this one is certainly the greatest of them all. Excellent cinematography, brilliant direction, Oscar-worthy performances, great background songs, fantastic dialog, outstanding mix of humor, action, drama, romance and tension, mind-blowing twists, and overall the most perfect TV show ever created. Every actor is excellent, even those who appear for only a couple of episodes, absolutely outstanding villains, fantastic story, every single shot is golden, and it's the show that put basically every actor who was on the show a worldwide hit. This show can make you cry, laugh, get chills, fell intense, put your on the edge of your sit, scream and much more. This show is an absolute gold. I watched it twice and every time you remember why this show is much more than perfect.
