How far will you go for the sake of your family? What will you do for providing your family a better life and better future? If you want your answer this is the show. A father who is a chemistry teacher, and suffering from lung cancer gets involved in the manufacture of meth-the pot, so as to earn money for his family and provider them a better future after he is gone. It is his story how he handles every situation and saves himself till the very end. The role of Jessi Pinkman is the one, which gives the show a cutting edge, how he always creates problem for Mr. Walter White. Hence, all i would say is that it is a must watch show... and those who are in love with chemistry its like icing on the cake...!!!
