Breaking Bad is an amazing show that perfectly executes an outlook on human nature. With compelling characters and unbeatable story lines, this is easily one of the best TV shows of all time.

It's my #2 favorite show, behind JUSTIFIED, but, this show is fantastic. It's the most intense show I have ever scene, and is the only show to actually bring me to my knees after a very shocking scene. That NEVER happens with me.

Walter White was simply a chemistry teacher, who was working two jobs to provide for his family. But after being diagnosed with cancer, he knows he has to set up a future for his family before he dies. He has a brother in law in the DEA, and teams up with his former student, Jesse Pinkman, who's now a drug dealer, to deal as he cooks meth.

In all, this show is very worth watching, but it's not an action series, where every episode contains a shootout, that's what I like about it, it evens out the violence and the drama perfectly!
