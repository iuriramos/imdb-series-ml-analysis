I sincerely believe that everyone here has lived through one of the greatest shows in the history of TV. I highly doubt another series will surpass Breaking Bad - the calibre of the show was just unbelievable. The acting; breathtaking. The plot; riveting...heartbreaking. The writers; genius. The soundtrack; compelling. The character development; unparallelled. Everything about this show was unforgettable, and there's a huge breaking bad shaped void in my life that I will never be able to fill. 

Thank you to everyone involved in the making of Breaking Bad, because it was, quite simply, perfect. ï»¿
