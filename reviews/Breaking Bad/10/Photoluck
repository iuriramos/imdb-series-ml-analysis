It's more then excellent, it's a master piece. I never heard about this series until a few weeks ago, here in EU you don't get the change to see them all. If you are here it is because you heard about it and probably currently watching it or heard someone talking about these series. The only think i can tell, go tell other people about this series, as you now you will understand it's unbeatable insane good written 5 seasons catching drama. The story, the character development, the setting, music, locations, reality, it has so many elements in to it, that no episode is boring and everything just sums how it should and what you just never have seen before.
