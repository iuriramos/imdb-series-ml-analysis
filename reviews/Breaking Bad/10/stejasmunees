I was one of the person who thought this show was overrated while I wasn't yet completed with Breaking Bad. Trust me, patience is all you need till Season 3, Episode 4, after which slowly things will start to gain pace. The initial episodes are slow and thorough to give a clear picture and depth of the family/social situation Walt (the protagonist) goes through. The last episode is worth enough to watch the show completely. It is an awesome show which gives you mixed emotions/impression on the protagonist (Walt).

I say hold on and keep watching it. It is one of the epic stories you will see.
