This is my favourite show by far, it is rivalled by very few other TV series. Some people say it's slow, but that's the pacing of this show. It build up and explodes, and me personally, I like that pace, I don't get bored by it in any way. The writing is excellent, the acting only makes it better and the character development is crazy good. Walter is quite the typical guy but he slowly becomes a different man. Every scene has some kind of impact on the show and it can be subtle too. The camera work is jaw-dropping. I've maybe watched Breaking Bad 4-5 times, every single episode. It's arguably the best TV series of all time and the awards only prove that it's true. As for negatives go, I can't really find any.
