This show is simply the most captivating series I have ever watched. For the the past several years Dexter has been the only show on TV that held my interest from week to week......until now! I watched the first 3 seasons in a matter of days. I have become totally invested in the main characters, and am amazed at the chemistry between the cast members. It's refreshing to finally see a show that allows Bryan Cranston to use his skills to full potential. The man is a superb actor. Needless to say, Walt (Cranston) is my favorite character on the show. Coming in at a close second is Dean Norris, as Hank. Once again, a tremendous acting job. His character, along with Bob Odenkirk's character, Saul Goodman, provide much of the comedy relief. Speaking of Bob Odenkirk, it's good to see him thriving in this role as the "dirty lawyer". At first Saul seems like a simple comedic character, but as the show progresses, different sides of Saul are revealed. If you are looking for a good show to start watching, WATCH BREAKING BAD!
