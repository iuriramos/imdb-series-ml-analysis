I have enjoyed every episode of this show. It has the best cinematography I've seen in a show with it's scenery and colour enhancement and the definition of everything to make effect on how the programme wants you to feel. Also, the acting is just amazing. The dark theme of this show really makes it that much more awesome because there just isn't a show like it, aside from 'Death note'. I love how the story line is so well thought out and constructed. The progression of the show and transformation of each character is simply great! The pilot is amazing and the episode I just watched "Ozymandias" is stunning. The show makes you feel emotions and really takes you into it, it makes a lot of people feel like they're actually experiencing what the characters are experiencing emotionally. The show is the most intense show I've ever seen and I've watched 'death note' and many other TV show's (Dexter, game of thrones, the x files, sons of anarchy etc); but Breaking bad beats them all. It is just incredible in so many ways, I love the way it makes me feel and it has elements of every emotion which I think is great, although the comedy is very dark, it is still comedy and I think it's great that they managed to fit that element in. I love how this is a show with a story line that has to end and I think that with it ending in the next 2 episodes, it is a wise decision and I'm glad the directors and writers have chosen to end it now as it show's that they are wanting this show to go out with a bang and it also show's they are wanting a good story line rather than a long lasting show for money. So for my conclusion: I would recommend this show to everyone who can experience it, I love this show and I am really sad that it is coming to an end yet it is right to end it now.
