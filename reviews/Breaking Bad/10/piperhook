if you haven't yet watched Breaking Bad, you are missing out on the best writing, acting, pushing-the-envelope, gripping, thrilling drama out there in t.v. land. absolutely superb and shocking. i'm so proud of amc for taking a chance on this show. the second season was even better than the first and that's a tough nut to crack. i was a bit taken aback in reading the IMDb summary statement on this show - i don't find the main character to be in a "mid-life crisis" but rather a life & death crisis of provision for his family. i find him innately unselfish which is in complete opposition to a mid-life crisis. not the greatest job in summary of such a stellar piece of narrative genius. 

i won't spoil further other than to say...get on itunes and rent seasons 1 & 2 soon! season 3 starts in just 2 weeks!!!
