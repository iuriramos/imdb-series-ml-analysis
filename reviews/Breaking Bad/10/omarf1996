Seriously, no joke. This is THE greatest show of all time. There is a reason why your friends are always preaching this show as the second coming of Jesus Christ. Not only do ALL characters get development but the story literally had me reacting. Normally i'm watching a show like a potato but THIS show literally had my fist in my mouth at one point, I almost fell out of my chair out of suspense.

Seriously watch the first 5 episodes, you will be hooked. My favorite series of all time. Better than Game Of Thrones, Dexter, The Wire,Sopranos EVERYTHING! Well for me anyway. If you love a good crime thriller this is the show for you. Hope you enjoy!
