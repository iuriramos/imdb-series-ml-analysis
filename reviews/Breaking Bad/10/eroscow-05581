Breaking Bad is easily the best TV show ever made in my opinion. I've watched a whole lot of TV shows but none get you more hooked and immersed in the action than Breaking Bad.

First of all, the writing from beginning to end is phenomenal. Originally created by Vince Gilligan to be a dark humor you can see aspects of that throughout the whole series. As the series progresses it gets a lot more dark and serious. Although they still retain some of the dark humor like in the last episode where Walt says he has the "two best snipers west of the Mississippi" trained on Gretchen and Elliot and really it's just Badger and Skinny Pete with a laser pointer. The cast is another great thing about this show with each character developing in their own way and transforming over the series. Bryan Cranston did an especially good job. Coming from someone who hadn't seen very serious roles before Breaking Bad it really showcased his versatility as an actor.

I've known a few people who hadn't seen Breaking Bad and I had to convince them that they needed to! Most thank me and say it's better than any show they've ever watched before. So if you're on the edge about whether or not to watch this show I'd recommend watching it A.S.A.P.!
