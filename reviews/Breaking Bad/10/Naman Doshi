After watching Breaking Bad , it seems that I've made some legendary childhood memories. This series made me cry,gasp and I could hear my heart drumming most of the times. Aaron Paul did an awesome work. Jessie was/is my favorite Breaking Bad character. The part which I loved in the entire series is that WALTER WHITE NEITHER DIES OF CANCER NOR GETS KILLED BY MAFIAS. He was the sole reason behind his death. And that part where he says to Skyler ,I DID IT FOR MYSELF. IT MADE ME FEEL ALIVE. That part was just legendary. I just cant believe that its over. Gilligan, please surprise us. I still cant believe that he is dead. Jessie on the other part was the only one who got out alive. But man,he deserved much better. He was just a kid after-all. Walter White ( Bryan Cranston ) Totally amazing work! I could feel that change. From S1 to S5 , a complete transformation.
