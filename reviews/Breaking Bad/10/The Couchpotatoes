This is one of those top of the league series. Once you start watching you can't stop it. My wife and I were completely hooked on this series. Brilliant actors with a great storyline. A lot of twists that makes it that you want to see the next episode as soon as possible. The suspense that is build in every episode is great. You can't do anything else then hope that Walter White gets away with it. Too bad that at one point the series had to stop because for us it could have gone on and on forever. So we were disappointed when it was over but now that there is a spin off we are already looking forward to that one. If "Better Call Saul" is in the same way then it can't go wrong. Anyways, "Breaking Bad" is a must-see if you never saw it.
