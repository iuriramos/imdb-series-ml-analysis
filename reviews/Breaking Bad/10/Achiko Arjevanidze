It's hard to say something that hasn't been said about this TV show before. just to start with a cast, their acting was above every level of awesomeness, every single character, their lines, all of them were very interesting. plot was unbelievably cool, they way Walter Walter's character changed over every episode was just mind-blowing, it was done in such a way that you don't even notice until he does something unexpected. the final was one of the best endings I've ever seen, it was just pure definition of perfect. you literally can't find any flaws in this show. even most boring episode (fly) was very interesting because of it's dialog, and character development. pure awesomeness, can't say more.
