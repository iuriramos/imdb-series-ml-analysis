This has been absolutely the best thing I have seen on T.V for years...no...EVER! From the moment I started watching it I just wanted to see more. My husband and I watched this together and would often try to guess what was gonna happen next....99% of the time we were completely wrong. I loved that. I found the characters all very interesting and great to see how they progressed given their situations at the time. It would have been nice to get some closure on some of the characters and what happened to them afterwards (Skyla and Marie mainly) but I think I will survive.

The downside of watching Breaking Bad is that everything else on TV now seems disappointing :(
