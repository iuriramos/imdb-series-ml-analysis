At first my oral English teacher recommended this TV series. The first several episodes of the first season seems boring and the plot goes slow, showing some very ordinary and simple scenes and actions, but when I continue watching I find myself unable to stop watching... I think the most successful thing of Breaking Bad is that it reveals the complex relationship among people(e.g. between the Walter couple and the Hank family) and the desire of humans. What Walter White wants is not to end his life like a loser(Maybe being a high school teacher is not a bad thing, but what about being laughed at by his students and have no money for cancer treatment? Whatever, he could be so rich if he did not quit that chemistry company.) In the end Walter White says he cooked crystal meth not for his family but for himself. He says he is good at it. I think this may be some kind of self fulfillment. He feels like a accomplished person, a real man. This is really a brilliant TV series I've ever seen.
