Compared to the other great TV shows, Breaking Bad is spare and stripped-down. The creator seems to have taken a very basic literary form -- the classical tragedy in five acts -- and set out to expose the self-destructive hubris at the heart of one of the greatest TV characters of all time. Walter White is the White Whale to Hank, and Lear to himself. I don't actually know how it's going to end, but it plays with the foreknowledge of tragedy we have in our gut (those flash- forwards are a particularly good way of evoking this feeling). Contrast it with, say, The Killing, where absolutely nothing was predictable, which left viewers feeling played with. Maybe we actually like shows that have some element of predictability.

It's easy to see just how completely this show breaks the TV mold by slicing away the other genres that have both enriched and bloated pop entertainment: soap opera, novelistic realism, black comedy. For all its greatness, The Sopranos was bloated with soapy elements; The Wire, greater still, was committed to a certain kind of naturalism; Weeds always had the complex tone associated with black comedy, and (completely failing to sustain that complexity) eventually degenerated into a sitcom. You don't get any of this with Breaking Bad: there are just a few larger-than-life characters (no wasted ones, really), and a pretty small universe. It mostly looks like it's been made on a post- recession shoestring budget (at least compared to AMC's inferior costume drama Mad Men). It is brilliantly acted and directed.
