I am not exaggerating, this show will go down as one of the best shows ever. Try to point out a flaw? It has the best writing I have ever seen. It has amazing and interesting characters who you get connected to. I am very sad that there will never be another episode of this series. It is a gem. A show like this comes around only once in a lifetime. Don't miss out on this opportunity, watch this show! A show about meth? How do you like that? I wondered the same thing before I began to watch it. After a few episodes you will realize that it is much, more than that. Experience the "growth, decay, and transformation," of Walter White AKA Heisenberg. Witness the great tale about the family man chemistry teacher who broke bad!
