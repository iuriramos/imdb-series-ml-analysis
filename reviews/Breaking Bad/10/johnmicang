This show is as addictive as the drug depicted in it. This show not only brought on laughter, tears, and a sense of fear... but the realization of the true potential Bryan Cranston has to be the greatest actor of all time.

If you are considering watching this show, you must do it. As odd as the description may sound, it is incredible relevant. I found myself connecting with the main characters more than I would like to admit. It drew out emotions in me that I never thought a TV show ever could. It may sound a bit over the top to say something like that... but you can only understand by watching this show. Never have I EVER seen any actor preform as POWERFULLY and CONVINCINGLY as Bryan Cranston did in this series.

This show proved me many things... but the message that will stick with me forever, is that we all "Break Bad".
