I knew about this production since a long time, but I couldn't bring myself to watch it until two months ago. So many people have discussed the merits of "Breaking Bad" for such a long time, that I finally brought myself to watch it. And suddenly I stepped into a world so real, that my own everyday life was enriched by this piece of collective artwork. There are not enough words to describe all the feelings and thoughts which crossed my mind when I watched the brilliant performances by Bryan Cranston and Co. The script is very bold, but also true to real life. Vince Gilligan and his team have constructed an arc of episodes which present a modern tale of how an ordinary (or not?) person can break bad under dire circumstances. And how a man can win and lose everything in a short period of time. No matter how hard I try to judge the main character, he is always more true than ever - acting and reacting to the world he lives in. The blending of different personae in one man shows us the real face of the human nature. We all feel connected to this story namely because we relate ourselves directly to many of the aspects of the characters in it. And to be able to express the whole spectrum of human emotions is what defines us not only as viewers, but as people who are able to feel empathy, even to the worst kind of behavior. To me this main character and this story embodies the spirit of our century - accepting without regret what we think and do - with all the consequences brought by our decisions. And after all, these decisions define our lives.
