I watched this show after I saw that it was rated a 9.5 on here and I must say that I was not disappointed! Right from the first episode where Walter White (Bryan Cranston) was standing in his underwear pointing a gun at a non-existent enemy all the way to the final showdown that ended this addicting series, there was not a single episode where I wasn't glued to the screen.

The characters were brilliant and complex, and the actors who portrayed them were legendary. Not to mention that the show was very funny at times too! This series had everything from me clawing at my chair in anticipation of what was going to happen next to me cracking up laughing uncontrollably. If you're looking for a roller coaster that will leave you wanting more, this show is for you! For those like me who also want more, they have Better Call Saul now too!
