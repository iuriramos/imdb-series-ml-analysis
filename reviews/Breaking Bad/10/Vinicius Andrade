How could I give less then 10 to one of the best TV series of all time??? Breaking Bad surely is already recognized as a masterpiece and one show that will be remembered for a long time. Having a story so original and so bold that is very hard to not like it watching just one episode. The high number of nominations and awards received by the show is just a glimpse of what this series has represented so far.

With a production and direction so good in creating an environment to the show be forged, the performance of the cast in the creation and development of the characters, even those who become relevant in future seasons, are made in a such extraordinary way. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul do an outstanding performance, presenting us with two characters that already have become iconic and memorable in people's mind.

The only bad aspect of the series is that is already over. Of course I would like to have more episodes, but the way which the show were built until the season finale was perfect.
