My guess is yes definitely. It's a brilliant piece of art, nasty and extremely shocking. I watched the first Season and I thought, yeah well, it's awesome, but I think Dexter is still better. Then I watched the second Season and was like, alright then, but I think the second Season of Dex was still a bit better. But then with the third Season and thing became sure. This Show is better than Dexter. Beter than every Series I've ever seen. But finally after thinking it can't get more thrilling, the fourth Season came along and blew my mind in every Episode. These perfectly worked out Characters this visual brilliance, this extremely convincing story. The way this writers made you love and hate all the Characters at the same time. And of course, the unbelievable shocking events of the final Episode of Season IV that blew my mind and left me in a numb mood that least for hours. Amazing, f***ing Amazing!
