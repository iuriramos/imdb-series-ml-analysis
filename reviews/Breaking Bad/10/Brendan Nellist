It normally takes me a while to figure out if I enjoy a TV program but in this case it took just the pilot to let me know that I was going to enjoy this. From start to finish I thoroughly enjoyed every episode and never felt let down by any means. It is the most well written show I have ever seen and leaves no stones left unturned. I have recommended this show to all my friends and will continue to do so, you have not experienced excellent writing, acting, directing and casting until you have experienced Breaking Bad.

Breaking Bad will always be remembered by myself and others as the greatest show there has ever been.

ALL HAIL THE KING
