I've never seen anything like this before. These so far two seasons about a man, a father, a husband, a chemical-teacher who gets cancer and start to try out as a drug dealer is a step-by-step-analysis of which consequences this decision can have on your life, family and friends. It's a emotionally roller-coaster ride without big gun shoot-outs or explosions though it shows that many mean things are getting to control your life.

This show doesn't fill every clich√©d that is connected to a drug dealer story so it can reach it's sure audience. No! It tries to figure out (and of course it never can be reality, but it's trying to get as close as it can) how to deal with these chliches when they're suddenly entering and ruling your ordinary, normal, average life.

You cannot call this a movie, though you'd like to, because it's the only thing that you can relate to that ever reached such quality. And this is why I don't want to devalue Breaking Bad just to a TV- Series that can be seen randomly on TV. Again: No! It's 15 Hours of high quality. It's 15 Hours of the best thing made out of picture and sound ever made. It's 15 Hours of Art. Art in Directing. Art in Cinematography and especially Art in Writing and Acting.

I love it!
