Breaking Bad is a collection of the most intense , nerve wracking shots ever in cinematic or TV history compiled with some of the most LEGEN...(wait for it)...DARY acting . If you can just endure some boring sections in the first couple of seasons , they are necessary for plot introduction , you will also see some pure gems in regard with cinematography, direction and acting . I think (and most people will agree) that BB's Star-Cast takes this show to a new zenith. I don't think anyone in the acting area can replace Aaron Paul drug addicted , "b**ches" crying Jeese Pinkman or Dean Norris's Hank Schrader or Bob Odenkirk's Saul Goodman, the list goes on. But its Bryan Cranston Heisenberg that ultimately steals the show. His one liners, his monologues , his stares , his anger , everything is pitch perfect. A dying responsibility laden father or a drug kingpin , both roles are delivered by Cranston perfectly and smoothly. You may not love Mr Walter White , but you cannot hate the awesomely cool Heisenberg , you just cannot . And if you go through first couple of seasons , the rest are not just gems , they are pure 1000 carats of diamond . In short , if the painting world has Mona Lisa , the Music world has Beethovan's 9th Symphony , Baseball has Babe Ruth , Basketball has Michael Jordan , Cricket has Sachin Tendulkar , Football has Pele , Hollywood has The Godfather , then the TV definitely has BREAKING BAD . Do not Miss this B**ch , you'll regret it forever.
