In an age where nerds and geeks might seem empowered by the likes of 'Community' or 'The Big Bang Theory', true geeks and nerds know that Walter White is the true avatar of geek apotheosis.

We have watched Walt slowly metamorphose into his demonically cool alter ego Heisenberg with more shock and awe than we did Jeff Goldblum's Brundle become the fly. So this is a modern American Macbeth, subtly scifi flavoured and as addictive as the crystal meth White so skilfully cooks.

Ultimately, Walt doesn't just kill and plot to further his "Empire" - he wants to avoid DEA brother-in-law Hank from ever discovering his activities while seemingly caring that Hank is protected and genuinely affected when Hank is attacked and then threatened.

He may be caught, or go on the run but the greatest conflict, the outcome of which may never be known, is the spiritual battle within Walt. Does the Tyrant Heisenberg eventually wrest control of his soul, or the martyr for his family, Mr White, win?
