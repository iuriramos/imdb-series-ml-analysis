The best story builds up and characters making that I ever seen. Firstly, I didn't like it too much. I liked it. But not much. But from the fourth season, I was getting interested in it. I really like the way that Vince Gilligan build up the characters as well as the story. It's really seamless. You can't think what's gonna happen next. I really liked it. 

And the next main thing is I don't count Walter White as a villain. He is sort of a Hero as my point of view. He is a coward, selfish & A- hole as well. But he is one of my heroes. 

Jesse Pinkman is my favorite character along all of them. Because he is the most innocent guy in the entire show. He is trying to keep peace every time. But I really like the dialogs of Saul Goodman. The every single word of this show is from Vince Gilligan's mind. That was remarkable. 

The second main thing is the editing style of it. As a video editor, I learned so many things from this. I've watched some scenes again and again. Still, I can watch them. 

America is a great country and a Worst country. And my dream country. America is suffering from this kind of diseases. And America helps for those who raised their hands for against them in every possible way.
