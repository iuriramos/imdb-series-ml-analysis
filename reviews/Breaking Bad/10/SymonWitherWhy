What more to say that hasn't already been said about this immaculate show. Imagine your Chemistry teacher was Tony Montana... Wouldn't you like to know what he gets up to in his spare time!

When i 1st saw this advertised i was like "ahh man why do i wanna see a middle aged man run about in the desert in his under pants with the worlds dodgiest moustache EVER" 

But my curiosity got the best of me, so i wanted to know why and how it got to that! The intro is like a peek into the future of each episode and you always want to know how things got to that and how each episode unfolds will blow you mind every time!
