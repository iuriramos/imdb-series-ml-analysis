To be honest, when I heard about this show, I wasn't interested at all. I'm not much of a TV guy, so it shouldn't be surprising that I wasn't interested in the first place. After a few years after it started, a friend of mine recommended this show to me and I finally watched it. I was blown away. I have never watched a series more addictive or gripping in my entire life. After each episode, you'll just be wanting more and more. This show has everything such as perfect writing, unforgettable scenes and a top notch soundtrack.

I honestly believe Breaking Bad is better than most movies ever made, and that's saying a lot. I would highly recommend this show to anyone. If you have not seen this show yet, start with the pilot episode and go on from there. You will not be disappointed in the slightest.

Score: 10/10
