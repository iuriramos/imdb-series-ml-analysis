I have got to admit I am not much of a TV show fan, but BrBA made me one.

I finished watching seasons 1 through 5 in less than a month. I guess you can understand how addictive BrBa is from that.

I tried watching several other TV shows but nothing came close. The most exciting feature of the show that I found is Mr. Walter White and his brilliance. Walter White is easily one of my favorite fictitious characters of all time.

The five seasons deal with different issues and all are equally incredible.

I have never felt so sad when a movie or TV show ended. It was truly heartbreaking, I thank the Breaking Bad team for making such an awesome show.

Miss you Mr. White!
