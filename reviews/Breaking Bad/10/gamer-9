Alongside Mad Men, Breaking Bad is probably one of the best TV series out to date. The cinematography and storytelling are topnotch, surpassing the quality of many films.

Characters range from the quirky to the downright sinister. Bryan Cranston from Malcolm in the Middle dissolves completely into his role. He has an everyman likability that continues even as his character descends into inhumanity. The believability of the situation is vital to the show, and all of the other actors do an excellent job of maintaining it.

Stylistically, it's a bit reminiscent of the Coen Brothers, there are certain changes from episode to episode which make things more interesting. 

It'd be ideal to start watching it from the beginning, however any one episode will pull you quickly into the story. Sometimes there is a weak plot point here or there, but its makes the show all the more unpredictable. As I watched BB I discovered foreshadowing, subtle messages, symbolism, and moral dilemmas which I won't go into detail here. 

Overall, Breaking Bad is a unique show packed with humor, action, and drama that will appeal to a wide audience. The storytelling, though, is always central, as it should be.
