"This is must see TV" that's all you need to see it as fast as you have a chance since the season 4 is coming now. Past three seasons had created a die hard fans base over the world. From the acting, the direction to the unique style combining from the classic gangster dramas in history of motion pictures such as The Godfather, Scar Face, Pulp Fiction, No country for old men, Fargo etc...... Breaking bad shows us the new golden generation of cable TV drama by the brilliant creator Vince Gilligan and multi Emmy winner Bryan Cranston

The plot is simple. An underachieved middle class chemistry teacher name Walter White, lives in a small town of a common state in US. Who also has incurable cancer and a family which he can't afford.

Then.....he decided to break bad 

Within the desperation and honorific, Walt and his ex student Jesse Pinkman took us to a hilarious journey but no short of thrill and suspension name "How to transform from loser to a Godfather!! For dummy!!" 

AMC really makes it' slogan: "Future American classic TV drama"
