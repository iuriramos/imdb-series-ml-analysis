Undoubtedly the best television show in recent history. When you invest so much of your time in a television show and share so much sympathy for the main characters it becomes hard to say goodbye. Now that Breaking Bad is over it has only hit me now, that it in fact, it is the greatest television show in history. What the cast a crew did with this brain child of Vince Gilligan is beyond extraordinary. The writing that this show produced will be well remembered and used for a reference for future television dramas. Although Walt got what he deserved in the end, he in fact went in a place he felt most a home, and perhaps most powerful, in a "chemistry" lab. He remains one of the greatest and saddest television characters to date. Bon voyage Walt.
