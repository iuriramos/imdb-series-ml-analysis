After watching entire 62 episodes for the third time, it is time for me to write a tribute to the greatest TV show ever. I was reading some reviews on the site and very few of them had one star and even those small population of reviews instantly and immensely pained me. It got me to think how you will always have a section of people who cannot bring themselves to like even the best things in life. Such reviews are really sad. And this show does not deserve anything less than 10/10.

This TV show is epic - well written, well acted and well edited. It is Shakespearean. It is an instant classic. From the first episode to Felina - gripping, endearing and loftiest style of story telling. Memorable performances by the actors that will get permanently etched into your memories. No amount of hype does justice to the sheer brilliance of this show.

This show should be on everybody's "Things to do before I die" list. Do yourself a favor, go watch it. I'm onto my 4th round.
