Honestly, I never watched anything of this genre as good (or even close) to this series. 

Over the course of 5 seasons, you will witness the evolution of the nerdy, old, overqualified school teacher, Walter White to ruthless, crazy and scary drug criminal. Started from an unexpected tragedy of getting cancer which sparks the criminal mind inside Walter. The first season deals with a struggling Walter juggling his daytime job and his meth-cooking career with Jesse Pinkman, his ex-student. They went through some thick moments as newbies in the upscaled meth operation. The series evolved well as both of them gained enough experiences in the business. This series just got better and better until the end. 

I can't help to dislike Hank, though, I really think he should've died earlier lol. But seriously, this series is such a gem, watch it, at least once.
