What can I say I'm An addict very much like the junkies in the show but weed, meth, nor heroin is my drug. Breaking bad is my drug I bought and watched all the seasons even season 5 part 1 within the time period of a month.

Before my favorite show was the walking dead. Well that changed as soon as I finished the first season of breaking bad. No exaggeration I swear on my life this show has the best writing, acting, and directing that I have ever seen.

If you haven't seen this show go to the store and buy and watch all the seasons as quick as you can so you can experience the final greatest 8 episodes of all time. The only words that really come and stay in my mind is that this show is the greatest thing to hit any screen in the world and for me that will never change.

Lastly I don't care what you think of my review but take my input. This is my favorite film and show it is pretty much considered both. Thank you for reading and start watching the show Breaking Bad. "All hail the king" Breaking Bad fifth season tag line
