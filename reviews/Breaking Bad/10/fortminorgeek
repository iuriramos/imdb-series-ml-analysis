Breaking bad is a series that contain violence, drama as well as action, witch make it the best series ever. I can't begin to describe why i like breaking bad. It is just when you have seen a couple of episodes you are hooked! In my opinion the acting is magnificent and the music Vince has picked is really really good to. Breaking bad can be a little weird and slow sometimes but you don't mind because it's awesome anyway. I know this review probably sucks I just wanted to share my love for the series. I have to say that everyone should watch this the minute they get the chance. That's all i have to say about breaking bad for now, just watch it because it is worth it I promise!
