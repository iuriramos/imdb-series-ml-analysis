What we have here, in this show, is the art of character construction taken to perfection. Every single one of them is believable and their actions do not seem like fiction, on the contrary, it looks like they behave as anyone would if pushed to the same limits. But only good build characters wouldn't make this show what it is. Added to that, the directing was precise and the screenplay never gave to much, and put WOW moments in right amount and pace (there are a lot of twists, but the show doesn't rely on them to keep you watching it). 

The show itself changes with its main character: it starts as a dark humor comedy, slowly changing into a drama and in the final seasons becoming sort of a thriller, but never losing the hallmark of the show: the character construction. Walter White doesn't becomes a crime genius all of a sudden, instead we see that evil was already inside of him in the beginning, he only lacks the motive to release it. Doesn't we all?

This, my friends, is a truly 10/10. This is the difference between telling a story and dragging the spectator into one.
