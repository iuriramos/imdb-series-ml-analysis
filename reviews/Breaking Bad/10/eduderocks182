I love this show. No show will ever be better or as good as this show. I love the characters,the actors and the storyline. The best characters are Walt,Jesse,Saul,Hank,Badger and Walt jr. The best episode of the show is the one where Gus dies. That was amazing just watching him walk out of Hectors room after the explosion with half his face blown off. Season 4 was the best. It was amazing watching there feud with Gus fring and trying to kill him.I love the episode where Hank is shot by Tucos cousin. There were times when the show got sad like when Walt and Skyler divorce and when Hank dies. The last episode was amazing. The gun on the car was so cool. It was very sad watching Walt die. I miss watching this show. I've only watched two episodes of Better call Saul and I'm enjoying it but it's obviously not as good as Breaking Bad and like I said no show will ever be better or as good as this show. There are plenty of shows close to it but not as good.The saddest deaths on the show were Hank,Mike and obviously Walt. This is an amazing show and i'm glad I watched it.
