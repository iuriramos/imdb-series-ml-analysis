What more can I say about this show other than that it is the best show I've ever seen. I watched this because I saw that Ozymandias got a 10/10 and I saw all the awards and I was like, heck yes I'm watching this show. I finished it in under 2 weeks and was so intrigued every second of every episode. The last episode was my favorite ending ever. It ended perfectly! I love this show because of the phenomenal acting, writing, directing, and plot overall. It is a genius idea. Thank you AMC for making amazing TV shows. I love Breaking Bad. 

Nuff said.

Breaking Bad.
