Hype can kill some great things, and if you're yet to see AMC's Breaking Bad, this may happen. Breaking Bad has been held as the best thing to ever be put on television, but is it. My answer is it certainly is up there, action, acting and particularly characters. First the acting, Bryan Cranston's Walter White is comparable to Daniel Day-Lewis' Christy Brown, Heath Ledger's Joker, Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump as well as other acting greats. Facial expression is enough let alone the intense delivery of his lines. Newcomer Aaron Paul is superb as Jesse Pinkman, the junkie/independent meth cook, early on you may not be convinced that Paul can act, but give him a chance as well as the show can take a few episodes as this show is the character study of Walter White and how in different ways he went from top to bottom and bottom top at the same time, Dean Norris, Anna Gunn, Bob Odenkirk, Jesse Plemons and Giancarlo Esposito are particularly brilliant supporting characters (notably Esposito's haunting Gus Fring). The writing on this show is ON. Always ties in earlier episodes and even seasons, never neglects characters (Badger and Skinny Pete). The show's directing is certainly film standard with top directors like Rian Johnson coming in for an episode or two (Season 3's "Fly" was excellently shot and one of my favourite directing talents in TV). Each season has its particular qualities, Season 1's comedy, 2's sudden drama, 3's action, 4's intensity and 5's intensity/comedy/action/drama. Season 5 was the strongest season by far as each of the 16 episodes were television art. Character development and wondering whether you love or hate Walter White are the show's biggest strengths, on top of the exquisite writing, Breaking Bad is one of the greats
