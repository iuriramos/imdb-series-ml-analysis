I have always been meaning to review Breaking Bad, and with its two-year anniversary coming up this year I thought I would reflect on life without Breaking Bad.

If you have never watched Breaking Bad or have intended on watching it but never got around to it, the main message that I want to get out is, it is a show that you have to watch. If you tell me that I never get around to watching a TV series, I will immediately shut you up say, Breaking Bad has to be an exception. There are only a handful of shows that come close to the competing to Breaking Bad with Game of Thrones being equal in amazingness in my opinion. The amount of themes Breaking Bad directly and indirectly touch on is astonishing and is the main reason as to why I adore the show. That and the in-depth characterisation, compelling storyline and episodes and scenes that literally take your breath away (for those who have finished, Ozymandias, Crawl Space, Face-off, To'hajiilee are just some of the greatest pieces of entertainment that I have ever witnessed which is on the scale of both movies, TV shows and video games). 

I have never and will never forget Breaking Bad, even if later down the track a TV show does beat it in terms of my own personal taste of entertainment. At the moment, Breaking Bad will always remain on par with other amazing TV shows such as Game of Thrones. 

If you haven't watched it yet, I promise you will have the best time watching it. Don't think it's an easy watch, they deal with many themes and many scenes will make you toss and turn in bed but it is worth it. You also have to sit and absorb the series to fully comprehend it. The one person I know who hasn't liked it, passively watched the show and knew heaps of spoilers. 

Once you've finished, Better Call Saul is one season into the series and is a perfect spin off for Breaking Bad and stands on its own as a series. 

10+ out of 10 for Breaking Bad
