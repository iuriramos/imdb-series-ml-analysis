There's no doubt in my mind, that Breaking Bad is one of the best TV shows ever! 

Great storyline, well written and directed, the actors do a splendid work, great action/adventure/drama, everything is perfect, since the begin of the series until the end, and that's what makes this TV show so addictive.

Sad that's already ended, but I'm very pleased with the end of it, at least I had disclosure!

If you didn't saw it yet, is definitely a "must see".

I must say, I will miss this show!
