Bryan Cranston delivers a phenomenal performance as Walter White, the chemistry teacher who turns to selling meth after he finds himself with cancer. the writing is insane it's so good I can't think of a word to describe how good it is. Then you have actors like Aaron Paul and dean Norris who just bring to life these characters with such great depth you feel yourself getting attached more and more as the show goes on and really just a must watch groundbreaking beast of a show, probably the only show I could rewatch over and over again for the rest of my life and not get bored. Thank you Vince Gilligan for bringing this show to life.
