This is the first time I have wrote a review so bare with me. First of breaking bad is the best acting plot character based series I have seen. I loved dexter but this has taken it up a few notches I won't go into the story or what happens. I have just finished watching series 3 on Netflix and enjoyed it more than any other show on the television. The man who plays Walter is superb as is his young protégé Jesse together they spin a story that just keeps you wanting to come back for more too see where there life is going next. I don't know much about the director or production but they deserve an Emmy As do the actors because it felt as though they had put real people in unreal situations. But you still believed it was possible for them to be there and what would you do if it were you fantastic 10/10
