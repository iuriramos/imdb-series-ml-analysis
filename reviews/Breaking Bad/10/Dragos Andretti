The amazing series ended with an equally impressive episode, which connected all of the flashforwards we'd seen and methodically led to the story's conclusion. It gave us closure on everyone we cared about  and satisfyingly finished off the ones we really wanted to see put in the ground.

"I did it for me," Walt said, and there you have it: the dark pit of the soul of "Breaking Bad." Walt was never good. Walt chose evil. "I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really  " and here he paused. "I was alive." It's remarkable to think back on all five seasons of "Breaking Bad" and see so many perfect notes like that, so much pit-stained anxiety, so much confidence in the story that it set out to tell, but also so much confidence on the part of Gilligan and his writers to let the story tell them where it wanted to go.
