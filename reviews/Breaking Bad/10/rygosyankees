This show will go down in history as one of TV's best dramas of all time. I have been a big fan since the beginning, and AMC does a terrific job with this show. 

Walter White (Bryan Cranston) plays a 50 year old, run-of-the-mill chemistry teacher with really no excitement in his life. The day after his 50th, he finds out he has terminal lung cancer, with maybe only a couple of years to live. Walter discovers from his brother-in-law Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) that selling meth can make a lot of money, which Walter wants in order to secure his family's financial future since his wife Skylar (Anna Gunn) is making very meager income. 

Walter teams up with his ex-flunked out student, Jessie Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to make the meth and sell it to customers so he can make at least $737,000.

That's the beginning of the series. As time goes on, Walt and Jessie team up with a number of kingpins and other drug operators, and both of them begin to turn to violence in order to protect their power and safety in the world. As they gain more power, Walt's family begins to learn about the business (except his son, Walt Jr.-played by RJ Mitte). The family feels very threatened and now see Walt as a monster who continued to lie to them. In the final season now, it's a fight for survival for Walt, Jessie, and the rest of the White-Schrader family.

There"s your plot. However, this show is brilliant for a number of reasons. But the key idea is definitely character development. In the very first episode, Walt makes a video crying and telling his family he was sorry, and that everything he did was for them. Then, in a very eerily similar way, in Season 5 Episode 3, Walt made a video blaming the whole meth operation on Hank, with no remorse in his voice. Walt, once an innocent lamb, now has turned into a villain. The whole crew at AMC did a wonderful job with this series, and I'm going to be upset when it ends.
