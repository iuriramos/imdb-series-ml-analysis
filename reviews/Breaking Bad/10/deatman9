I know thats a pretty generic title that you probably hear a lot but this is no exaggeration. This show is pure gold from start to finish of every episode. I watch the new episodes every Sunday religously and I cant wait until the rest of the season is aired. They are one season 5 and sadly it is going to be the last season.

This show stars Bryan Cranston. You may remember him as the goofy dad on Malcolm in the middle. Though in this show he is anything but goofy he is cool and calculating. Every performance of his is so good I really never thought he could act so well but every episode Im blown away. The side cast all does a very good job and the writing is just so intense and suspenseful it keeps you guessing every second.

This movie is about a chemistry teacher named Walter White(Cranston) who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. His world is shaken when he finds out knowing that without him his family will certainly suffer monetarily. So he makes the decsision to cook meth in order to provide for his family once hes gone though once entering the drug game things start to go out of control.

This is with out a doubt the best show on television Im so upset this is the last season. This show is great for anyone who likes suspense and a terrific show. Some people are put off by the subject matter of this show but that should not put you off if you don't watch this show you are missing out greatly.
