Breaking Bad is one of the best TV shows to ever air in history. Now for me, this is the best TV show I have ever seen. Just seeing this guy go from being all nerdy and timid to this tough and self absorbed man is truly incredible. I have to give it up for Bryan Cranston. He is one of the best actors living right now. He was born to act. I mean his face just has so much emotion in it. Most actors have to try and get the right facial expressions to play that character right. But Bryan's face can make a wide range of expressions without even having to do much. And oh my goodness... Aaron Paul... When I first saw this show, he didn't seem like such a good actor. To me at least he didn't. But as the show goes on, his acting becomes phenomenal! Like when he gets mad in the show, it makes you think that he's in full rage in real life. It's truly amazing. Everyone did an amazing job on Breaking Bad. Every single character in the entire show was incredible. Breaking Bad is the gold standard of television.
