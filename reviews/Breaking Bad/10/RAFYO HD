Breaking Bad to me is the best TV series on TV, so terminating all shows like South Park, and other shows that have a new story every week and have no connections. Breaking Bad I would say is the best series on TV because you can watch it 24/7, yes I know it may sound a bit sad, but, I watched this all week end and managed to get through to the middle of season 3, the I started watching with my dad and he got hooked so I pretty much told him the basic things that had happened up to middle season 3. When we got to season 5 we loved the show, a new cliff hanger at the end of every episode, so much bad ass scenes, we stayed up to midnight on a school, and I'm 13. So when we got to the last 4 or 5 episodes I couldn't watch anymore because I had to go to bed, but my dad carried on watching it till 4 to 5 o'clock in the morning. So I watched the end by my self as he had already done it, and it was the best ending ever, yes they where a few disappointments, but every finale has the goods and there bad's. Almost every day since it ended I thought about the finale and how they could carry on (Jesse side of the story) and (Walter in prison) but that would ruin it because it ends with us knowing he dies in prison, it's just that, I need it, I'm actually starting season 1 to middle 3 again to watch with my dad and 'Better Call Saul' is coming, so everything will hopefully be better in Breaking Bad area, if you are reading this and you don't watch it, do.
