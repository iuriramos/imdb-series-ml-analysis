As a convicted cinephile, as someone who loves the 7th art and and treats cinema as a part time job I would never expect to be doing my first IMDb review on a series. Then again, for me, this levels up to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction or even Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather.

This is an astonishing series, by far the best drama ever created by the industry. The pace is absolutely breathtaking, the plot thickens episode after episode and the characters' magnetism is simply extraordinary, as if each of them was "handcrafted" to please those who love cinema. Bryan Cranston was apparently not the first choice for the paper but he fits like a glove in the different stages of Walter White. Aaron Paul had to have been a Jesse Pinkman in another life seeing the way he gets inside his own character. Anna Gunn, as Skyler, makes you change your feelings towards her character, from love to hate, numerous times during the series. RJ Mitte turns an ordinary "it's just the kid" character into a monumental performance during his 5 seasons as Walter Jr. Also a quick word for Giancarlo "Gus Fring" Esposito, bow down ladies and gentlemen for he is, in absence of proper words, splendid.

Do not, in any case, leave this series unseen, you will be missing the most pure (I dare to say beautiful) drama / crime ever. A huge "Thank You" to Vince Gilligan for bringing us this amazing methamphetamine rush.
