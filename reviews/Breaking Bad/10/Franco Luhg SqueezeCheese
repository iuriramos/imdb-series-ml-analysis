okay, so recently i was recommended a show. it was called dexter. i got so hooked on it that watched the first 5 seasons in 5 days. 12 hour a day sessions. i was like seriously hooked on it. once that finished i decided it was the best show i had ever seen... the same man who recommended that show then said "watch this"... and gave me seasons 1-4 of breaking bad. "its the dad from malcolm in the middle being a bad ass...". i was sceptical to say the least. i stuck it on and watched the first 3 eps. it was OK, but seemed a little disjointed. but i persisted and am so pleased i did. because after that it just took off. had me totally hooked. cranstan is just brilliant as the chemic genius walter white. but he is backed up by the even better arron paul as the street wise yet quite stupid jesse pinkman. the chemistry (excuse the pun) between the two is incredible and you get engrossed in the relationship that develops between the two as much as you do with the story itself. brilliantly written. beautifully acted. and dare i say... better than dexter... pfffffft..... its a bold statement but i think it may be you know... :)
