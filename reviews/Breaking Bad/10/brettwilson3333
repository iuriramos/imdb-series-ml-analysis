This was one series that continued to get better each season. Bryan Cranston was great in the lead role. Fantastic show, great writers. The story follows in a logical way that would be believable if it were to actually happen. The supporting cast around Cranston was very good, and the list of actors brought in throughout the seasons added to the show, without many distractions. Sal the lawyer was always a pleasure to watch, and he added some humor while still retaining a character that seemed to fit in with the drama going on around him. Aaron Paul played the perfect accomplice. Everyone actually performed very well throughout the entire series. Jonathon Banks, Dean Morris, and Giancarlo Esposito really stood out also.
