To be honest i was not so fond of this show when i started it. I watched the last episode before i finished the first. Everyone was telling me that it was such a good show and that i should keep watching it. So i continued and i fell in love with the show. I watched it a year ago completely and now i am watching it again. The characters are so good and the plot is amazing. This is the best show i have ever seen and i don't think there will ever be a show that will be as good as this one. The first two seasons were not the best but it starts to get really good at the end of the second season. I watched 17 hours of this show in 2 days thats how good it is. If you have not seen this show i suggest you watch it immediately.
