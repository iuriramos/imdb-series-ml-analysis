OK, so when I see a critic give a movie 4 stars, I immediately say, yeah right - because the hype, the type of movie a critic considers to be 4 stars is many times not the same kind of movie a person looking for something great would consider 4 stars. Reviewers and moviegoers are worlds apart on taste.

Now, I give Breaking Bad 10 out of 10 yes. But it isn't for everyone. Watch the pilot. And then, if you can stay with it, and watch the next and the next, I am almost confident it will completely grab hold of you and a show about a lowly chemistry teacher turned meth cooker will become your drug of choice - I swear - but that's only if it grabs you.

The base scenario: Chemistry Teacher, who had aspirations for bigger things stuck in marriage to controlling wife with son who has Cerebral Paulsy and wife also baby on way. Brother in law works for the DEA. Chem teacher finds out he has terminal lung cancer and after finding out from DEA bro-in-law the huge money involved in cooking meth, decides to get into it to provide for family after his death (secretly of course).

It's 3 seasons old with a 4th season due in July 2011 and it has only gotten better season by season. It is amazing, gripping, disgusting, upsetting, emotional, slick, pathetic, scary, adrenalizing...and a bunch of other words - all in one shot.

The reason? The acting and writing. These two things make Breaking Bad the best show I've ever seen on TV. The acting is so freaking' good. Also, the writing isn't just what you're seeing on screen. It goes deeper than that. The way the actors execute bring the writing to levels unheard of in TV.

Fans of Dexter or Six Feet Under will want to try this one out. Even if you're not, give it a try and maybe you'll like it. Me? I'm a nut case about the show so I'll say try it no matter what you're a fan of.
