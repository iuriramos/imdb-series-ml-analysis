My rating: 9001/10. Over 9000! I used to think that Game Of Thrones, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: The Next Generation were the three best TV shows ever made, but Breaking Bad is on a whole other level, the level of genius is out of this world. It's the only TV show I've seen that cannot be rated simply a 10. Giving it a 10/10 only gives it an "excellent" rating, it's much more than that, it's a masterpiece among masterpieces. I've seen hardcore fans of: Star Trek, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, Walking Dead admit that Breaking Bad is much, much better, so much better it cannot even be compared. The skills of the camera team are the best I have ever seen. The actors are the best I have ever seen. The music is the best ever. The story will stay with me for the rest of my life. The script is mind boggling. Breaking bad is so powerful that it will change the way I live my life forever.

I also used to think that the actor Bryan Cranston, the main actor in Breaking Bad was a terrible actor. I could not have been more wrong. The only reason why Bryan Cranston was terrible is because the TV show Malcolm in the Middle destroyed his reputation in my eyes.

The show also even contains hidden subliminal messages, flashes of information on the screen, quick references to libertarian politics and was most probably written by a libertarian who follows the Austrian School of economic thought. I could clearly sens the social and economic awareness of the author throughout the show, pure genius. There were also references to former congressman Ron Paul, my all time favorite politician.
