Have you ever heard your parents say to you something on the lines of, "You weren't alive for any of the great shows back in the day." Well, if you were born >2000, I'd say you were. "Breaking Bad" is such an amazing show. The producers and script writers knew exactly how to get you to connect personally with the characters. They're just so relate able and real-life. It seems like they're just recording the lives of the cast because the actors play their roles beautifully. Many will tell you that it's "over hyped" and i say, yes and don't you think there's a good reason for it? It's very difficult to not spoil anything

so i'm just going to tell you the bear minimum so you can go watch it yourself The main character, Walter White (Bryan Cranston (also played in "Malcom in the Middle another good show) who is in a dead end teaching job AND car washing job full of very disrespectful students. During his 50th birthday, he almost seems left in the dirt behind his sisters husband, Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) who is a cop that is bragging about a massive drug bust. He goes on a ride along with him when he spots one of his former students fall out of a window. You can find out the rest by watching yourself. You WILL NOT regret it. I promise the beginning is very slow but for good reason. The first couple seasons are explaining the characters lives.
