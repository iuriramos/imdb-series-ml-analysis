I know I am jumping on the band wagon here, but in my defense, I started watching this show from almost the first episode. My mother recommended it to me. I remember going to FX On Demand often to see if there were any new episodes. They were far and few in between at first I think they were being picked up on a show by show basis. I remember when Aaron Paul tried to shove himself into a bin to see if they would be able to put a body in it after Walter shot the guy they are keeping down in the basement. I don't remember his name because that was like the first season. I just became, like everyone else in the country, addicted to this show. Its character driven and plot driven. I love the different characters they introduced like Saul and Chucko and Gus. The whole Gus story arc has amazing. I would find myself gasping and saying, "man I love this show"! Two that come to mind are Aaron Paul's girlfriend Over-dose scene and the plant in Walters's back yard. If you've seen the show, you know what I mean. GASP! They are scenes that establish how much Walter is actually, "Breaking Bad". This show totally deserves the Emmy's it's won. When Jessie gets beaten up by Hank and ends up in the hospital and the rant he goes on about Hank was great. I was even thinking, he's going to get an Emmy for this. It is just a truly well written show with no gimmicks or loads of special FX to over-shadow the great story telling. My favorite thing about it is the relationship between Jessie and Walter. Those two are great together. If you are one of the only people left in the country who haven't seen this show, watch it now!
