Breaking Bad is one of those shows that gets big through word of mouth- mostly because everyone who sees it forces their friends and family to see it too.There's no point in explaining the plot, because you either know it by now, or you could look it up really easily. The characters are very memorable, the kind of characters that will be remembered by fans for years to come. Walt, Jesse, Hank, Saul, everyone is perfectly written and perfectly acted, making the characters some of the most complex ever put to film. Bryan Cranston is the greatest actor in the history of ever. Each season gets more intense and beautiful than the last, and season 5B looks to be the best one yet, considering the brilliant build up of 5A. I think the best episode is the season 4 finale Face Off, which is one of the most intense hours of television ever created, with an incredible final shot. The cinematography and music is all perfect. I don't care what you're doing, watch this show now. You'll thank me later.
