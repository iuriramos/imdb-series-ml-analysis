I just love Breaking bad, please do not tell me episode 5 is the end of it can we get more please, i hope the is a plan ahead?

I have been waiting long now to be told the is season 6 coming up, is the anyone who is doing something about it or that is the end of it all? i just cant wait to hear the good news.

the story line is on point and it is indeed interesting and i would not mind to extra 10 episodes BB and it is indeed so different, the creativity is on point and you can compartmentalize between Breaking Bad and the random series I have ever watched.

I hope this massage get to the right people and if the is something on queue i cant wait.
