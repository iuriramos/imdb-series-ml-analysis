Breaking Bad (20082013) is one of those TV Series in which I loved so much that I had forgotten to write about it. I didn't realize that I hadn't put up a review so over the last week, I watched every episode again and it rocked.

Breaking Bad (20082013) is a perfect TV Series filled with a cast that will keep you entertained, and a story that can capture the audience. From season 1-5 the show stayed on point and right with the vibe through and through excluding the last two episodes. The last two episodes of Breaking Bad were probably the weakest of them all, it's as if they were told at the last minute to tidy things up that the show was going to be stopped. My hat goes off to the crew who made the show and how well the quick ending was pulled together, but too many pieces pulling together on closing made it seem rushed. Other than that, top end show; one of our favorites.
