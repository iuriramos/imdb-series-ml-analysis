Breaking Bad is a series that could go into TV history books! Nothing from these days can top these series!

I watched seasons 1 till 5 in about 3 months. So the storyline is still fresh in my mind. It is remarkably how good the total fits together. There really aren't any gaps. In the beginning, it became already clear to me that this is going to be something good. Great acting off course, and a new kind of story we never heard before in a series. Also, the story felt extremely realistic. Mister Heisenberg, or Walt, had my compassion. I understood him with a little trying. But the story evolved quickly. Things became serious and Walt had to deal with more criminal facts than just cooking. But still Walt seemed to pull me to his side. Walt is a flexible character an changes gradually into a psychopath rather than be a family providing man.

Also, on the artistic view, the camera-work and editing was done great. It was not a simple drama series. There was a lot of attention to beautiful flashbacks and flash-forwards. Also the camera shoots often in a lot perspectives. And if you pay attention, the use of music is very accurate.

Lastly I would like to prize the series ability for not only be a standard drama, but also adding action and thriller or even horror at some times. The blood shedding is realistic. There isn't that much killing. And if somebody has been killed, there is a lot of attention payed to the disposal of the remains and processing the loss.

I would recommend this not standard high quality series to everyone! (Well, except kids)
