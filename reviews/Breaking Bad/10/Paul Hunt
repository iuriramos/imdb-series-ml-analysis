Firstly and foremost i'm not going to blabber on with a comparison of other successful television series i.e, GOT, SOA, LOST, DEXTER and the rest of these brilliant projects. This is a series in an entirely different and unique realm of TV.

After hearing through the internet/tabloid grapevine that Bryan Cranston would be taking the lead in a new AMC series it got me very excited and anxious,..anxious with regards to the fact that this fresh series would be conveyed in a ''Black Comedy Drama'' setting, to which I felt intrigued whether Mr Cranston could pull it off? not only does he 'Pull Off' the role of Walter White in this 5 series bonanza, he moulds walter white into one of the biggest on screen marvels of ALL TIME, Bryan Cranston is a truly terrific actor who deserves nothing but praise and commendation for his electrifying performance as the power hungry, ruthless Meth Kingpin...Just for the record his display of Walter White is so good it grabbed the attention of Hollywood legend Sir Anthony Hopkins who personally wrote an email to congratulate Bryan Cranston on his depiction of Walter White.

Obviously the show isn't glorious purely on Cranston's acting ability, huge credits have to be awarded to the brilliant cast namely Aaron Paul Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, RJ Mitte, Betsy Brandt, Bob Odenkirk and many other worthy actors/actresses who brought this series to life.

It would be scandalous of me not to mention the brain behind this project, Vince Gilligan, a insanely talented and imaginative screen writer/producer/director who injected the show with a shot of pure class.

Overall I just can't describe how perfect this series is, there just isn't enough words, even with the 1000 characters I'm allocated for this review.

Bottom Line, just watch it, it will probably be the finest thing you'll ever set your eyes on. It certainly was for me.

Magnificent.
