My First review here, so let's go to it.

After Watching Breaking Bad this year i was in shock because it was Such a great show that i had to keep digging and finding more info about the show and maybe alternate reads of it, after seeing the color theory i will have to re-watch the whole show and pay more attention god i want to erase my mind and watch it always i'm jealous of EVERYONE who can watch breaking bad at first such a beautiful series my favorite of all time by FAR.

After the End and all of my research on the internet i have finally landed here and absolutely Agree with the grades (execpt the series it should be a 9,8 MINIMUM but h8rs everywhere), and man i think no series will ever get a 10 again because giving a 10 to another show would be the same that being said it's even with breaking bad and at this point no show is even close so like the title says: It will be Hard to give another 10 after seeing this show.
