A rave review of Breaking Bad doesn't do the show justice. My words have been said by many, but I'll say it again, Breaking Bad is the greatest show of all time. It goes to another level. The story is intriguing and, in the sense that many men with little income are diagnosed with the financial and physical burden of cancer, quite relatable. The use of symbolism is evident and is done in such an intelligent way. The show is written with such versatility and excellence. Vince Gilligan is able to write each of his characters in the own way; he uses wit and humor, while also effectively writing dark, dramatic scenes and lines. The acting is - for the most part - unbelievable, which is mostly a testament to the show's star, Bryan Cranston. He captivates audiences with his dilemma that they sympathize with, and he presents a dramatic, and sometimes laughable character, which he brings to life. Supporting roles filled by the likes of Anna Gunn, Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odenkirk, and Jonathan Banks are performed brilliantly. The show is directed in such an interesting and unique way. 

What really goes a long way with Breaking Bad is its standalone nature. You'll never watch a show similar (except its spin-off, Better Call Saul, which is also phenomenal). WATCH THIS SHOW AND WATCH IT NOW.
