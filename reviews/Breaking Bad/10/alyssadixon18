I cannot say it enough-The character development from season one to 5 is incredible. I am seeing some blossom, some deteriorate, some grow stronger-Its what keeps you wanting more! Totally worth starting at Season 1 Episode 1 if you have been considering it, jumping in the middle means you lose a lot of what makes you salivate for the next episode, that being the hints and sparks of things yet to come. You fall in love with Jesse's adversities and Walter is a character you can almost understand because of the things he encounters-even on his extreme level, you can still get him and who he is. So much action and hidden messages or jokes, its like seeing a new clue every time you re-watch the episodes. There is nothing I can really say negatively about this show overall. Some episodes are full of build up and can be anti-climactic but if you feel you are losing faith-give it another episode and your mind will be blown. Its one of the best shows I have seen out these days-I find myself cursing out loud because I become so invested in the action and the plot. I suggest this for anyone who enjoys movies such as clockwork orange or Django.
