Breaking Bad is a show about a man, Walter White, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Walter is a high school science teacher with incredible knowledge about Science, specifically Chemistry. The costs of Chemo Therapy have put his family in a awful financial position. Whilst on a ride with his brother in law, Hank Schrader (Who is also a DEA agent), he notices a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman running away from a drug lab. Walter tracks down Jesse Pinkman and asks if they could be partners in the drug bushiness, where they would produce 'Chrystal Meth.

Once Walter began his drug career, his life went down track. He went crazy with power, began to kill, began to put his family second and himself first, all the while his brother in law was trying to track down Walter himself.

This television show is a once in a lifetime experience. Everything about this show is perfect, the shots are sublime, the story is incredible. Everything is incredible. A must watch.
