Breaking Bad created by Vince Gilligan and the happiest writers in Hollywood, is about Walter White, portrayed by Bryan Cranston. A Chemistry-genius, who is stuck in a dead end high school teacher job with a pregnant wife, Skylar, and a teenage son, Walt Jr, who has cerebral palsy. After he gets diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer, Walter starts cooking the purest crystal meth in America with his partner Jesse Pinkman, Portrayed by Aaron Paul. Basically the whole plan that Vince Gilligan had for this show was to show a transformation from "Mr Chips to Scarface". It is the first time that a protagonist of a TV show has had such a drastic change from the beginning of the show to the end. Tony Soprano, Don Draper and Omar Little always stay the same person and never change which is why we are so interested in them. However Breaking Bad is all about change and transformation. Other than Walt, Jesse changes from a druggy man-child to a scarred man who has seen things that would even traumatize a gangster. Walt's DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank Schrader, also changes from a overweight joker who doesn't take his job seriously to one of the best investigators and bad-asses ever seen on television. Believe me half of the bad guys (Tuco, Salamanca twins) are killed by Hank in this show. Along with Walt, one of the best villains and characters I've ever seen is Gustavo Fring. There are many adversaries that Walt faces but none have ever been as dangerous as Gus Fring. A quiet force that likes to be well dressed and formal but is cold and calculating. The calmness that he had when he slit Victor's throat and blood sprayed across the room was truly disturbing. Then quietly taking a shower and cleaning himself up like there was nothing going on was truly frightening. Breaking Bad took the action that you normally see in blockbuster movies and made them better. The exploding non-meth scene with tuco, Walt running over the two drug dealers and, of course, the explosive death of Gus Fring and the final shootout with the Nazis were all shocking and amazing. Usually when I see TV shows or movies I think that that I can write better than what I see. I think anybody could have written a better finale for Dexter or have made the second season of The Walking Dead less boring. However Breaking Bad truly had some of the most flawless writing I have ever seen. Quite possibly only The Sopranos, The Wire and Game of Thrones have writing that is as good as Breaking Bad. In conclusion, Bryan Cranston truly deserves the awards and admiration he has received for his portrayal of Walter White AKA Heisenberg and Vince Gilligan truly made a masterpiece. The ending depicting the survival of Jesse and the death of Heisenberg was perfect and fitting. Breaking Bad is amazing! YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT!!!
