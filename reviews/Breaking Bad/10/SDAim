Although Bryan Cranston has won the Best Actor Emmy now two years in a row, I think people are still really slow to catch on to "Breaking Bad". Perhaps it's because it's on Showtime and not accessible to all, perhaps it's the premise which, if like "Dexter" is explained in one or two sentences, might seem off-putting -- I don't know. But I'm so glad a friend of ours mentioned it to us a year or so ago, and we immediately NetFlixed to catch up so that we can be watching this season as it unwinds.

I love everything about this show -- the acting, writing, directing -- and I have to put it up there with other great shows like "The Sopranos" and "Dexter" that find a way to skillfully inject humor into the most seemingly horrible/terrifying/grim situations. We have since turned several people onto this show, but my husband's best friend still isn't budging -- he insists he finds the premise too "depressing" and just won't give it a chance. Too bad -- he's missing a real gem.
