The reader's opinions are spot on. But, all viewers need to accept that 'Breaking Bad' is pure entertainment ... not a morality play or the balance of good over evil. Greed, avarice, and moral voids are part of all human life. That, in itself, is what makes this one of the best (if not the best) of American crime series in the 21st Century. Just as Forbrydelsen (Danish) and The Killing plowed new fields, so is 'Breaking Bad'. Breaking bad - Especially our ongoing 'war on drugs' adds a special cachet to the stories. All future US crime / drug / action / justice - including crime and punishment genres will be judged by this marvelous series. Wonderful ... we will not miss one episode ... and we live in Asia. We love it. Better than 'The Wire,' 'The Shield,' or The Sopranos. We can only hope that they find a way to extend the show for another season. Excellente!
