Let's talk for a moment about how this TV show looks - it's stunning. The blues of the New Mexico sky, the browns and tans of the desert, the lights at nighttime, and the blue of the pure meth. In an era of great TV, Breaking Bad'd stunning visuals put it ahead of the pack. Just look at the framing of the shots, the odd camera angles. There's so much to see here visually that you really shouldn't watch it on a small device, but always on a big screen TV. We know all about how great the acting and writing is, but the look is in a league of its own. Oh, and then there's Skinny Pete. And Badger. And Saul. And the Twins. And Hank. And Tuco. And so on.
