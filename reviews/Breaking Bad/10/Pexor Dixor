Yes. A Masterpiece. The full essence of the human condition and the opening of the Dark Door that lies in all of us. What would we do? How far do we go doing what we think it's the right thing even when everything starts to fall apart? Can we keep our goals or will we always want more and more? Can we stop? Can we give up? What will we do to protect the ones we love from the pain and suffering we caused them? Was it worth it?

This is the show. If you haven't watched it yet PLEASE DO and don't give up on it. Each episode is perfectly made and the Ending well... for me it was the best ending ever of a TV Show, you will not be disappointed and when you finish watching it you'll just stand up and scream not knowing if crying of happiness or sadness..
