WE WILL REMEMBER YOUR NAME.

This show, and especially this season has transcended television programming in a way like no other, we never in a million years deserved a gift like this, but we were lucky enough to have had it handed to us on a silver platter. How did it earn such universally high critical praises and become so absolutely adored among all types of fans year after year? It doesn't have mind bending, mesmerizing special effects, it has no zombies and it certainly isn't about vampires. Breaking Bad has shown us how a simple narrative with the correct execution and proper slow burn can become something that is so impeccable that it in itself becomes real. The father to all of this is the scripting and the writing, I will say it again, the writing. The show had an amazing staff and was perfectly cast but without the brilliant writing team to back them up it would have turned into another show with big stars who went to waste; boy did it not. This show had more memorable moments and lines than any program or film ever will. Breaking Bad dropped more jaws than any dentist would ever consider healthy, not by using grotesque savagery, instead simply by compelling us with consummately masterful story telling and the five greatest years of drama I will ever remember.

Farewell to a titan.
