It is impossible to think of every adjective to describe the epic story that is Breaking Bad. The show from beginning to end is probably one of the most incredible rides in the history of television. 

This series doesn't just dive into the drug trade and the criminal underworld that cooking crystal meth delivers, this show also dives into the lives of each character and makes you see the moral complexity of each and every character in the show. 

So why is it that I also said it is one of the worst series of all time too? Well it's pretty simple really. Once you see this show from beginning to end, you will be amazed... better yet so astounded, that you may not be able to watch ANY other show on TV because of it. No matter what you do, or what you say to yourself, you will almost always compare every other TV show to Breaking Bad and find that you will not find anything as incredible as this show is. The show is that amazing. I only watch Game of Thrones, True Detective, and Sons of Anarchy now because of it, and they still pale in comparison to this show.

And in fact, upon another binge worthy viewing of the show, it may actually be better the 2nd time around since you can actually see the changes that each person goes through without wondering what will happen next. I keep saying it to anyone that I'm friends with and others as well, you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching this amazing piece of art that truly will stand the test of time.
