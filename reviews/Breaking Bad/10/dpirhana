First of all: Breaking Bad is easily the best show ever made, great story, brilliant actors, 10 out of 10. Only one thing is a bit puzzling.. what is the point about all those allusions to Germany? Many characters (an they are not all nice guys) have names of German origin: Family Schrader, Ted Beneke, Gale Boetticher, Mike Ehrmantraut, Gretchen Schwartz, Dan Wachsberger etc. Walter White calls himself "Heisenberg" (a German physicist). Jessy uses terms like "Adolf" and "Hitler" to show his disrespect to certain people. Hank says things like "we are not in Nazi-Germany" or "there are enough Germans here to invade Poland". Last not least the company "Madrigal" that controls the drugdeals is located in Germany. To much for coincidence, or not. Anyways, the makers seam to have a special affinity to our country:)
