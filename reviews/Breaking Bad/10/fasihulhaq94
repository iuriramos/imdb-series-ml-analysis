I started watching Breaking Bad in 2011. I found the first season interesting but season 2 became somewhat of a bore and i left midway... DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.

I gave it a second shot in 2014 and it blew me away. I finished the remaining episodes in a week. The plot, storyline and character development is amazing and the main cast is brilliant!! Bryan Cranston plays a role that makes you sympathize with him no matter what monstrosity he commits but for me the standout was Paul Arron. The way his character changes over the course of the show was something to behold! If you have started watching the show and feel it is a little slow, PLEASE do not give up! It will be worth your while. Its the best show i have watched
