Breaking Bad is nothing short of enthralling. The writing, cinematography, acting, and plotting are all mind-blowing. The show is head and shoulders above the vast majority of what plays on TV these days. It's unbelievable. 

With that being said, this show is very dark, disturbing, and depressing, enough so to evoke intense anxiety and sadness in the viewer. This show is beyond suspenseful; it is riveting. At the same time, it is more heartbreaking than your average drama. There is a lot of tragedy in the show, yet enough humor to provide some occasional, much-needed comic relief. 

I have to admit, there were times when I did not care for this show. In spite of some shocking, gratuitous violence, I really enjoyed the first three seasons; however, the fourth season delves deeper into themes of addiction, guilt, and PTSD, and the result is unpleasant to say the least. The fifth season takes it even further, depicting physical and psychological torture that is painful to sit through. 

Even at its most disturbing, I must say it's actually hard to quit watching Breaking Bad because of how good it is. Breaking Bad is easily one of the greatest TV shows of all time, but I can only recommend it to viewers who have a high tolerance for graphic violence, abuse, and very dark subject matter.
