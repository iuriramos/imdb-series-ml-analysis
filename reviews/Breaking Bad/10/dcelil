This serial has been Bad example for the others so that they should improve themselves to reach the new standards set by legendary serial BB.

it would be great to see whole cast (except death ones) in new serial "Better Call Saul" where they can extend the story. 

in my opinion, Serial shows what will happen when ordinary people face serious health problems if they don't have enough financial source to afford the cost. People will better die instead of making a big hole in their family budget. Economical problems will lead people to Break Bad where they only can find temporary solutions with no happy end.
