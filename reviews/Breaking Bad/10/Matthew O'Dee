After hearing from many of my friends of a new show they have recently began watching known as 'Breaking Bad', i took it upon myself to join the group and view this show for myself.

From the first season and the depth of relationships of characters surround Walter White (Byran Cranston)I began a love for this show, and couldn't wait for each episode to be released to continue to view this powerful and dark story the writers behind Breaking Bad are producing. What better way to present this story than with a fantastic line up of professional actors and actresses.

One character that I felt a serious connection with was the character of Hank Schrader, portrayed by Dean Norris; Hank is a character who may seem at first to bring in humour and banter into the shows atmosphere, but as the shows revels more and goes deeper into the rabbit hole, we discover a darker side to this loyal police man.

I am currently on my second run-through of Breaking Bad, and i still feel all the emotions i felt in my first viewing. This show is powerful, engaging, thrilling in everything aspect and without doubt worth a watch. I would seriously recommend Breaking Bad to audiences, and give it my rating of 10/10 for its story, its characters, its camera work and visual style.
