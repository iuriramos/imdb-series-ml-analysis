You are lucky if you haven't seen Breaking Bad because what a treat you have in store!!! The acting is exceptional, the characters are intriguing to say the least, the story line is believable, and every single episode will leave you wanting to see more and more! I am a very picky viewer when it comes to movies and television shows and I hardly ever find myself addicted to a television show so I feel like if I love it then chances are pretty high that you will love it too! So go to Netflix or ITunes or Amazon, or wherever you go to watch television and sit back and enjoy one of the best shows you'll ever ever see! I really am envious of people who have yet to see Breaking Bad as silly as that sounds! But even though I have seen every episode I still am able to very much enjoy re-watching all six seasons. Enjoy!!!
