Watching two performances that changed the future of television is really a true wonder. Breaking Bad driven by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, is some of the best television you will ever be able to find. From sitcoms in the 80's and 90's, to the terribly clich√©d soap operas on today, this show is in another league of television. After being diagnosed with cancer, Walter White (Bryan Cranston) runs into an old student of his, and he gains the idea that if they cook and sell methamphetamine, he can make enough money to support his family long after he passes on (while trying to save his own life). I would not recommend this as a great television show, but as a six hour film. Each season seems like an overlong film, with great cinematography, perfect script-writing, and an electric performance by Brayn Cranston. It is arguably the best television show of all time, but I do not like to label. I love "Breaking Bad."
