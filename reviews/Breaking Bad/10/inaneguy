The very best program on TV. This is the first time I have ever felt it necessary to write a review for anything on IMDb. I think that it's safe to say that I was ecstatic with the first episode of the new season after the end of the writer's strike. I hadn't given my hopes up until I saw the second season and some continuity despite the strike, my hopes wouldn't have been given up in vain.

The key to making watchable entertainment is with good writing but the key to making GREAT entertainment is to design characters the audience can relate to no matter how morally ambiguous his actions. Breaking Bad not only does this in dramatic and broad sweeping fashion but with the quality and attention to detail normally reserved for doctoral dissertations. This is certainly Mr. Gilligan's opus.

In Walter White (Bryan Cranston) we find an educated and reserved hero forced into a roller coaster of self-discovery in which the very core tenants of our western traditions in life, morality and human rights are not only touched upon but exhumed, aerated and critically deconstructed. Why, when, how, and for how long? What are the limits of our humanity? For what would we be so compelled as to take the life of a stranger? In Walter White we see exemplified, the most timid of soul we would think least likely to violate the rules of society that bind us.

On top of this delving into the deepest of the shell that is man, we add great acting, striking reality and masterful writing. I love a concrete story without loose ends, this show pays off.

This show, for me, is truly compelling in that I'm compelled to watch every new episode, a first.
