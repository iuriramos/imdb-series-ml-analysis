Breaking Bad has changed the way we viewers judge television , once you watch this you will always end up comparing another TV series to Breaking Bad , always. The genius idea created by Vince Gilligan , a chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer partners up with a former flunk student to cook crystal meth. Walter White is very much a family man and will do anything to provide for his family , even if that means lying to them all , his wife, cerebral palsy son , sister in - law and brother in - law DEA agent Hank. It is very much so a dangerous road to take for Walt , but it is something he is willing to do. The continuous display of high standard acting from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul delivers us with an intense atmosphere right through the series , with twists and turns of the relationship between Jesse And Walt , it isn't something you can just take your eyes off . The series - long search for the meth genius 'Heisenberg' is Hank Shraders story in this series , with him only leading to realise n season 5 that it was in fact his brother in - law Walt , was the drug-lord mastermind. A true work of art from everyone involved and i highly rate this show to the highest standard , masterpiece.
