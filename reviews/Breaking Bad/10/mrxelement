Bryan Cranston...who would have known this marvelous talented actor can be such a menacing, dangerous, bad-ass that cooks meth and trying to become the most greatest kingpin of all time. He simply nails the role of Walter White from being a scared man who then transforms into the all mighty Heisenberg. Then we have our other characters from our wanna be gangster Jesse Pinkman, an annoying wife beautifully played by Anna Gunn, our D.E.A agent Dean Norris, and our purple loving freak Betsy Brandt. All theses people play their part wonderfully making the show exciting and not boring at all. As each season goes we get to met our baddies such as: Crazy 8, Tuco, The Mexican Twins, Gus, and Neo-Nazi brothers, including Heisenberg himself. This show will keep you on the edge wanting to know what happen next from the start. What makes this show perfectly is that everything ties in leaving no clues behind. What makes it even better is that Bryan Cranston leaves us a remarkable character who we can relate too and love till the end.
