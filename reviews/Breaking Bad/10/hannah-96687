Breaking Bad is not only the best show ever produced, it is also the only show that gets better and better with each season. The in-depth characterization, the superb acting, the witty lines, the beautiful cinematography and the captivating plot are the reasons this show is still rated #1 of all time by critics. I am happy I got to watch BB live on TV and I'm envious of those who will get to watch the show for the first time. It's so good that I was going through withdrawals after the series ended. I tried watching other shows such as The Wire, True Detective, Boardwalk Empire, The Sopranos, Deadwood, House of Cards, Lost and Prison Break, but none kept my interest the way Breaking Bad did. Even Game of Thrones, my second favorite show, couldn't compare to the consistency, thoroughness and shock factor of BB. Kudos to everyone who made this show possible for us movie addicts!
