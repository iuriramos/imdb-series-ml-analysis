Me and my partner sat and watched this together, we got addicted by just the first episode. The journey of the characters is phenomenal, how your opinion changes from one extreme to the other. Especially Walter White. 

I can't believe the difference in Walter from me wanting him to be not caught, then towards the end me wanting him dead. His character changed drastically, he became a evil, selfish aggressive man. 

And the journey of Jesse is always exciting and intense, with him battling his drug addiction time and time again, then his journey of being forced into things he doesn't want to do. 

Vince Gilligan is a very talented man, and has made a bloody good series. I've watched it all once, and no doubt about it I will be watching all over again, I've recommended it to everyone I know because it was probably the best series I've watched EVER!! 

Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul WOW! Fantastic actors.
