What a sublime and religious experience it was to watch this series. Bryan Cranston has become a great favorite of mine. The series portrays him as a chemistry teacher Walter White, who is making ends meet by also working as a cashier in a garage after school hours.

One day he collapses. He finds out that he has lung cancer and not long to live. He decides to set aside a large sum of money for his family before he dies - partly to satisfy his ego and partly for the love of his family. He gets his inspiration from Hank Schrader his wife's brother-in -law who is a DEA agent. Hank invites Walter to a drug bust where he spies a dropout student of his Jesse Pinkman(Aaron Paul) discretely sneak away. Walter follows Jesse and tells him of a plan to start-up a meth lab and make a lot of money for themselves. They make a vow of complete secrecy.

The series then deals with unforeseeable events that arise when it comes to selling the meth discretely without drawing the attention of the DEA. Walter wants to sell the meth in large quantity, but Jesse tells him not to rush it and keep selling it in small amounts while still making a good sum of money. Walter keeps on pushing Jesse and we see the first tragic consequence of that action. From then onwards, it is a roller coaster ride full of highs and lows till the inevitable end of the trip. 

The series is filled with colorful characters that you will remember for a lifetime, and an ending that will take your breath away...
