Breaking Bad displays perfection in every way possible. From the memorable multi- dimensional characters portrayed with excellent acting to the brilliant plot that is thoughtfully constructed so that every season, episode and second fits together perfectly. It's for any audience, from the analytical minded who consider all of the underlying messages, to the people who just want to watch a good story. While watching, it's impossible for anyone to not acknowledge the genius that comes from the makers of this show. To this day I haven't seen a better TV show and I really don't believe I'll ever see one better than this Breaking Bad
