Talk about a television show that got people talking. I haven't met anyone that at one time or another didn't bring up this show. When I saw the CNN report of people calling 911 because of a power outage during the final episodes of Breaking Bad, I knew this show was really special. If you haven't heard of it or seen it, do yourself a favor and take a weeks' vacation and watch it. There are several seasons, so make sure that you start from the beginning and enjoy every episode. At times things might seem to be a bit cruel, but that is what this drug business is all about. When there is a large sum of money involved, a lot of people want to get their share of it. You will feel bad for some of the characters in this show and you will feel sadness for others and there will be times when you feel like standing up and screaming, but it all makes this show one of the best you will ever witness. Hope you enjoy it.
