Ik had the luck that when VPRO started Breaking Bad they aired a week long every evening at 23:00 hours a episode of the Season one. At the start I realised that I've never seen anything that was comparable. There was comedy there was suspense. There was a normal family with his ups and downs. There was a brother in law at the DEA who had a very good relationship with his brother in law who gets into crime. But what was most astonishing was the fact that i could remember every episode. All of that beautiful filmed with sometimes surprisingly camera-shots and angles. Normally I watch a series but after a while the details and storyline are out of memory. Not with Breaking Bad. Every episode will stuck in your mind. The best thing you can do is sit down watch Breaking Bad and it will come in your live. All good things must end and sadly now the final episode was shown 11/5/2014. I'm looking forward to buy the Barrel so I can watch it again in remembrance of the Best Show I've ever seen
