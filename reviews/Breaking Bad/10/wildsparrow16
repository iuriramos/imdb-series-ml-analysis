It is too bad I got on the bandwagon for this one a few years late. It is simply the best drama I have ever seen. I did not think the subject matter would appeal to me, however, I was hooked from the first episode. Walter White is one of the most complex, tough, vulnerable, intelligent, and misunderstood characters ever created on television. The chemistry between him and Jessie is incredible. These characters are complex and incredibly vulnerable despite their hardened outer shells and line of work. You care what happens to them. Do not miss this show. Watch every episode. If you have ever loved someone, been ill or had no clue what your future would hold, or knew that you would do anything for your family, you will understand.
