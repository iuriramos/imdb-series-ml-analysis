Breaking Bad had a slow start. The first season took some time to get used to. The second season became interesting, and the third and fourth make it one of the finest dramas of all time. What's so interesting about Breaking Bad is that you simply cannot take any character's side and stay partial to him/her. The story picks up pace brilliantly as seasons progress. One of the major assets of this show is its razor sharp and quite splendid characterization.

Quite simply, Breaking Bad is one of the finest, American television has had to offer after the likes of Six Feet Under, The Sopranos and AMC's very own Mad Men.
