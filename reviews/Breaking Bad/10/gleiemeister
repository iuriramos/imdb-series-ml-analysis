I cant state enough how awesome the director and script is in this show. Its like Dexter with good artists and script. Pace is slow, but you are actually never bored. The show has no clich√©s, weird untrustworthy characters or poor acting. A MUST watch, give it at least two episodes before making up your mind.

Show never goes stale, you sympathize with almost all the characters have motives you can relate to, even if they want something completely different. The plot never gets out of line or far fetched, and episodes never ends in huge obnoxious cliffhangers. A fine mixture of crime, chemistry and soap all in one.

Good luck watching, remember to support the producer if you like it :)
