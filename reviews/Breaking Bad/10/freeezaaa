I don't know where to begin. This show fulfills everything I really expect to see in a good TV series. 

It has a way of even making the slow scenes entertaining. Not many films/series' can do that. It really is one of those shows where you cant wait any longer for the next episode. I recently bought all 4 seasons and have just watched it non-stop.

The acting is ace. I love the relationship Mr White and Jessie have, although at sometimes i feel pitiful for Jessie, the stray druggie who has a heart of gold. 

The way it incorporates all the setbacks to the drug production allows the TV series to expand its limitations and take it to unexpected twists, it is really hard to predict what will happen next in this show, which i love

All in all i believe it is yet to be beaten as a series.
