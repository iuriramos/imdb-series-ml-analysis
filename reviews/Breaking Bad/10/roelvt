For the first time ever I'm writing a review, just because the impact of this show. I don't like watching episodes weekly at all, I just wait until a blu ray becomes available. Not this time ! Had to see it right away every week. Watched many very good shows like Sopranos, True Blood, Dexter but this show is on top ! The perfect match between a superb storyline, stunning camera-work and soundtrack and most of all very, very impressive actors. Never watch TV shows a second time, but this show makes the exception. Really looking forward to buy the blu rays of all 4 seasons. I hope there will be a 5th season !! I'm very critical in spending time behind the TV. But Breaking Bad was every season high quality time. I envy people who are going to watch the show for the first time...you lucky guys !
