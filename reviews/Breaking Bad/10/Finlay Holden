This entire show is an absolutely flawless work of art. Fantastic writing brought to life by some outstanding performances, especially from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul whose relationship is really the foundation throughout all 5 seasons of the show. The great character development will leave you with strong feelings towards each character, be it love (Jesse) or hate (Skyler).

More than just a show about drugs, this show investigates how a 50- year-old man can turn from "Mr Rodgers with lung cancer" to a criminal mastermind and shows how this sends his life spiraling into darkness. 

This is done is such a way that will leave you wanting more after every episode - I finished the entire show in a week! I truly believe this show is unrivaled in TV today, including GOT which I am also a fan of. I have watched and re-watched Breaking Bad with family and friends, and if you have not seen it yet, I would highly encourage you to get watching! You will not be disappointed.
