So this is the one and only movie or television show I've ever given a 10. This is the best television show I've ever seen. Nothing else has ever rung more true than the script and performances in BB. Nothing more I can say about it. Perfect script, casting, acting, cinematography, foreshadowing, this is the benchmark now for TV and I'll be waiting for some ambitious genius to come along and try and take its heavyweight championship belt away. Watch it 2 or 3 times to take in all the juxtaposition and appreciate all the nuances. I'm not perceptive enough to catch it all the first time around. Bryan Cranston's extensive comedy experience lends just the right amount of levity to keep this drama true to life. Just go watch it. It's brilliant.
