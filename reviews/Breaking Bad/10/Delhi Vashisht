This's a serious story which indeed looks so realistic that in many ways it resemble how people really falls into crime! Rise in the story is scripted so well that in end if you would have been asked to resign from your job just to watch the remaining series, you would do that and think of yourself later :)

It's a masterpiece. I highly recommend this as the most watchful series. I'm a serious fan of Bryan Cranston, so I won't say that he has done role of his lifetime :) but he surely did a class act in this epic series for which he would always be remembered for and without him as "Walter White" "Breaking Bad" would have not been THE "Breaking Bad".

Aaron Paul has also done a classic role I enjoyed it but the real deal is Bryan's character "Walter White". Story revolves around him. Once you start watching this series you'll feel for all characters, you'll develop emotions for him and in end when everyone else hates Walt you'll become his greatest supporter!!
