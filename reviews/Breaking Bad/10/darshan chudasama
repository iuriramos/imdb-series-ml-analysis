this is a well made series so far there are only 4 series and do not know if there will be any more

well watching this series was great did not expect it , it got a low viewing rate because i think it was not as commercial as other but its one of them when you watch it , you want to see it till the end 

Bryan Cranston is the main character who is the dad in MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE , and he was the best thing about MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE and he is a true actor in this series and is very entertaining to watch , this series has a great ending 

the way its been shot with the camera is nice and there is some cg work as well that looks good 

i would like to say much more about this series as there is a lot to say but its best to see it for your self , what can i say but its well put together in my opinion
