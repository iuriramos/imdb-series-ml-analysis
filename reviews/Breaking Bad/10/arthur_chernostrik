I love Breaking Bad but honestly it is a bit over hyped. For my liking it's one of my favorite shows ever but I would have never expected it to have such an amazing rating. 8.5 IMDb rating sure but 9.4 is surprising. There are way too many filler episodes that build up for some epic craziness in the episodes following so you have to get through them. Also, I would have thought the acting, which I think is amazing, would hurt the shows rating. The actors play the characters so realistically that it might be mistaken for bad acting, especially Bryant Cranston playing Walter White. In real life, people in tough situations people tend to struggle with decision making. I believe that people who don't like this show, which I thought would be a greater number, don't understand that we are watching the characters from 3rd perspective. For us observing the events, it seems so obvious to how the characters should react, but put yourself in one of the characters shoes, lets say Walter's wife Skylar, and you would react SO SO similarly to how she did/does. The story line progresses so much throughout the seasons that it's hard to believe where it started. The build up to the main episodes is so great that it gets pretty predictable to what is the big thing that is suppose to happen but these main events are so crazy that even when we know what's going to happen, they are still surprising. If that even makes sense. You have to watch the show to understand what I am talking about. I highly recommend Breaking Bad. Try taking into consideration what I mentioned above when watching and you will be one of those people that understands the show and wont be skeptical of it.
