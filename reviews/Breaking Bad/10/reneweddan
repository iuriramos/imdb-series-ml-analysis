After the consistent awards this series has gotten, I caved in and decided to catch up on the craze, and I am everything but disappointed.

The story is about a high school chemistry teacher's introduction into the darker side of life, drugs. His wife is pregnant, his friends are successful, his son has cerebral palsy, and a couple other significant factors that cause his break-down from everything he once knew.

Bryan Cranston (Malcolm in the Middle), Aaron Paul, and RJ Mitte are my three favorite actors in this series. Bryan Cranston has won numerous awards for his portrayal of Walter White. Aaron Paul is one of the first actors I've seen that pulls off the "thug" style without being over-the-top or embarrassing. RJ Mitte portrays a kid with cerebral palsy extremely well, I hope he gets enough recognition. Anna Gunn and Dean Norris are both extremely talented in the series as well.

The series seems as if it has a limited storyline, but every episode leads to more potential, and it is bound to be a classic. The opening to the episodes are sometimes set in the future, which is creative and refreshing from the normal openings.

I cannot praise this series enough, let's just hope it continues to be successful. It's worth the time and money, perfectly perfect.
