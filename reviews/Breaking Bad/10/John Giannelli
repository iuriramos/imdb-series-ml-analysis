If you haven't already watched this series or are not sure then don't hesitate - just get it onto your watch list!

The use of unusual opening scene camera angles is fun. There are also some 'flash forward' scenes which just give enough away to put the full episode in context. All in all, the editing is outstanding and enables a quicker paced approach than some other more leisurely based series like the Sopranos. 

I watched the series via LOVEFILM but will be buying the box set so I can do it all again and see what I missed first time round. I've never done this before for any other TV shows. Life is NOT too short for a second viewing!

The next paragraph contains a spoiler so please stop reading now if you don't want to see it.

Spoiler START Only one criticisms and that is the unrealistic plane crash scenario. The coincidence is just a bit beyond what is acceptable even for 'poetic license'.
