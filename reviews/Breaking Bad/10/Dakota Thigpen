I am saying this to shut everyone up, For the last time, Breaking Bad Will always and i mean always be better then The Walking Dead No matter what, The Story is better, The Writer's are better, The show is better, You care about who get's killed and who doe's not get killed, it is sad, amazing, real, life, We are all saying Goodbye to the best Damn show on TV and one of the Best Show's of all time, if you have not seen it, then you are missing out on a Amazing show that will never be forgotten, If you are a fan of both show's, then that is great but do not say The Walking Dead is better, when you have never gave Breaking Bad a Chance, Goodbye to the Best Show on TV, I Am gonna miss this show, Breaking Bad was a work of art, a Masterpiece, and what a Amazing way to go out as one of the Best Show's of all time, Loved it all, My favorite show of all time, Great End to a Phenomenal show, Breaking Bad was just Awesome!!! #GoodbyeBreakingBad
