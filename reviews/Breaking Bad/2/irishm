I never believe any hype that claims a TV series is the "best of all time", just because my tastes tend to run differently. I do often enjoy some of these "bests", I just wouldn't rate them as highly. I didn't think "The Sopranos" was the best TV show ever, but I watched the whole thing and I got into it.

And then, there was "Breaking Bad". I just don't see it. Whatever it is that all these other people are seeing, I'm completely missing. I thought the first two episodes had some promise, but it failed to develop. I couldn't get with any of the characters, either to love them or to hate them enough to keep watching to see what happened. I wouldn't say my expectations were too high, because I make up my own mind about things and I wasn't familiar with any of the actors, so I really didn't know what to expect. But wow... there just wasn't anything here for me.
