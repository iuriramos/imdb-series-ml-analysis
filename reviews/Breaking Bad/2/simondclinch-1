When I read the synopsis a few years ago, already I felt that the storyline lacked interest for me and did not watch any of the series. Then recently some friends were so enthusiastic about the series that I finally got started on it.

So I watched all of episode 1 series 1 and then reflected. Now, it is not as if I am the kind of person who has trouble finding things funny that other people do. But I would say that let's say only half of the material out there that people will find funny will affect me that way. However, this material failed continuously to amuse or excite me in any way except for the suspense of the opening scene not being resolved until late in the episode.

I think of the first episode of a series as the pilot - therefore it sets the level of interest for an entire series. Which meant that after that I simply gave up on the whole series.

So what went wrong? Although jokes are never funny when explained, there exists an anatomy of humour that one can correlate to any given snippet. The general profile of something funny is that it has some element of surprise - it builds up a picture and the moment of laughter is when the viewer or reader is forced suddenly to see things another way. And generally that other way has to have a level of originality for the effect to work.

So I think the problem actually lies in the construction of the screenplay. As much as the ideas appear to be original, they do not unfold in a way that produces the comic effect. Nor therefore is there much occasion of suspense.

So for me the real question is why do so many people find it funny? I think that for me will remain a mystery.
