This show is stupid. It's a stupid show full of stupid Americans for stupid Americans. It fails when it tries to create any suspense and the plot is unbelievable. All of this show is terrible and a complete and utter waste of time. I regret every hour I spent watching this crap and it deserves none of the hype it has been given.

The characters are probably some of the worst, most unlikable, retarded characters I've even seen. Walt is a horrible person, Skyler is a stupid *insert word for a female dog here* (point in case, a shortened version of a scene. Ted: 'I don't want your money' Skyler: 'Are you blackmailing me Ted? Do you want more money?'), Jesse is pathetic man-child. Walt Jr just jumps on the bandwagon of hate, Marie is just a time filler and Hank a terrible cop who is incredibly insecure.

The only likable points in this show is when Gus walks out of the explosion seemingly unharmed, adjusts his tie then the camera shows his scorched face and he falls down dead and the scene where Mr.Minerals gets killed by Nazis. Hank Dying was my favourite scene as I hated him. I feel hatred towards the death of Gus as it led to the point where season 4 fizzled like a fuse on a damp firework and 'everything is going to be okay'. But oh no, the flower used to poison the child, the tension is palpable as a chemist isn't smart enough to throw away a goddamn potted plant (!) (sarcasm if you couldn't guess)

All in all, terrible plot, terrible characters, terrible writing.
