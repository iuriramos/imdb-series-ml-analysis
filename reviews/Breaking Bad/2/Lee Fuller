So disappointed with Breaking Bad, after so many people telling me it was brilliant, the ending being amazing. Well I couldn't disagree more, bored all the way through, apart from the odd 30 seconds at the end of a couple of episodes, then the next episode would start, and back to being boring.

I really wanted to like it, I just couldn't, nothing grabbed my attention, nothing about the show made me continue watching apart from the hope it would get better (based on friends & family telling me it would).

If you haven't seen it yet, I hope you enjoy it more than myself.
