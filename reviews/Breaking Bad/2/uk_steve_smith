Was expecting good things from this as everybody kept going on about it and had some great actors in it, but was very disappointed. It took me 2 attempts to watch it all. 1st attempt I only got to season 2 ep2 and gave up because I was bored. 2nd time round I watched up to season 4 as people said that's when it got good (It didn't get any better as far as I was concerned) I only finished it because there was 1 season left to go. It may have been better if I had of watched it before sons of anarchy but I had watched sons of anarchy before breaking bad and in my opinion S.O.A takes some beating and breaking bad came nowhere close to it. It was very slow and to be honest it was kind of like the saying "same s**t different day".
