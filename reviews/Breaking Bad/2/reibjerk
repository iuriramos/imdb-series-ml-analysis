See at the bottom for explanation on strangely spelled words;

This story starts off with some potential interesting plots and continues with some potential angles and plots. But sadly nearly all of what goes on - i.e. makes out the content of the series is based on an increasing stupidity ! Yes, stupidity! The main character who is supposedly a 'very smart chemist' and more, eventually fails to make any planning ahead. He has no ability to voice himself. And so on and so on. It is even a surprise that he is able to buy a hamburger at Macnudles, or take a p iss... It is just so annoying how everything he does fails because he is to stupid to do anything and this creates 'entertainment'.. Well, there's one slight exception; There are some parts - I call them parts - that are cut into the action that does not belong to any part of the main story at all - like parts of some other movies were accidentally put random in to this series. But again and again and again and again I have to watch one of the stupidest of men who initially were portrayed to have an IQ above (yes above) 50.... It becomes so annoying to look at all this stupidity - almost like me repeating myself now (only 1000 times worse). From another IMDb User: IMDb - you clowns. don't tell me there are prohibited words without telling me what the hell they are you time wasting goofs. For everyone else reading this. "P i ss ed" is a prohibited word. Can you believe this fuking sht? --- End Other User.
