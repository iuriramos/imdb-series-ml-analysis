Okey, so I thought this series wasn't for me because I wasn't really sure about the lawyer buffet and that stuff. But h*lly sh*it, How to get Away with Murder is sooo good. I think you have to start watching the series without knowing much about it, so I 'll just say that is about a law's teacher who basically teaches her students how to get away with murder (with a very specify murder, by the way) In every episode we have this individual crime, and the teacher and a group of students trying to win the case in court. But all the episodes are connected by the principal murder, of weach we see short scenes during the whole season (and of course, by the excellent cast of character that I have learned to love) This show is amazing, I specially recommend it for a marathon,because, my babe, you will never get enough.
