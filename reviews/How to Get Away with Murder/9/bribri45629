I think that people need to back off this show for not following real law school codes and such. Most people who watch this show I'm sure don't go to law school or practice law. Its A SHOW!!!!! People seem to forget that. It's to entertain not to follow real life things. Yes a lot of what happens in this show would never happen in real life but thats what so entertaining about it. Many shows and movies don't make sense. I could give a million examples of movies where everything that happens is unrealistic but thats how shows and movies are based and people need to remember that. Lighten up people and stop taking it so literally. If you don't like the show for the sake of you're not into the genre or you really just can't get into it, it makes sense but Don't listen to people's opinions about not watching the show JUST because it doesn't depict what actually happens at law school or in the criminal justice system. WATCH THE SHOW FOR YOURSELF and make YOUR OWN OPINION based off of that. I really enjoyed the show, its entertaining, and a good binge watch for netflix.
