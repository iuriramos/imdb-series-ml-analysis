The show is very thrilling and written in a very smart way. What I love about this show, is that they constantly make sure your mind is blown. The show keeps alternating between present scenes and future scenes which makes you very thrilled to know how can this character become this character and do these stuff, and by the end of the season, the present scenes and future scenes merge into one another in a very professional way that does not get you confused as to what happened. Every episode they give you a clue and show you one more thing about the story, which is great for me really, because I hate waiting for seasons and seasons to know stuff, and then get shocked that they canceled the show, or no questions were answered because the directors forgot details that happened all together. They let you know a lot each episode, but still not enough, only to get you hooked. The actors are absolutely great, each character displays a completely different personality than the other, but somehow they complete each other. 

Excellent Series. Excellent Script. Excellent Director and absolutely excellent actors.
