I had no idea for existence of HGAM before. A friend suggested me to watch it. Generally, i don't like series with mystery only and i prefer thriller or horror series, such as American Horror Story.However,one day i decided to watch a few episodes to spent my time. Result? I can't stop watching it anymore... Firstly, it is not only a mystery series. It covers a large range of preferences such as thriller,action and comedy sometimes. Annaliz, the professor of a group of university students, tries to protect them from a big misunderstanding with the risk of herself and her career, while, in parallel, she fights with their own demons. Viola Devis is unique in her role and very talented actress. The series has stopped until February and it is in the second season. I suggest it to all the people.
