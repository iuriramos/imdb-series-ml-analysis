I love this show it is better than Scandal. I feel like a kid opening up their presents on Christmas morning when this show comes on. Every scenes is so good it gives me chills. This show is definitely with watching. What I don't understand is all the unnecessary commentary and hate on this show. Of course it's not like a real courtroom lawyer, its and over exaggeration of what a lawyer and law professor does. no one but a kid would think this show is like real life. It's not meant to be like real life hence the words drama and mystery. Second the gay sex scenes make since to the story seeing that Connor uses his sexual prowess to get the information that he needs. He's and over achieving slime ball with no morals. It's a two for 1 special sex and private information no one can get, it's priceless. I suspect that most people who watch the show are 25 and older and have some real world experience, so gay sex scenes should not be a big deal.
