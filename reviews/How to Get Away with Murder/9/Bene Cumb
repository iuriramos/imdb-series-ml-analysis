I was hesitant to start watching, as I was afraid that the series would "absorb" me in all aspects - direction, plot, performances. And my fears came true, I had to make the time to watch them in succession and within the shortest time-frame as possible. It was all so intense (at times, a bit too much, or I am just accustomed to slow pace in legal dramas), and the performance of Viola Davis was splendid as usual. 

As for the other cast, it seems that male characters are more elaborate and versatile than female ones, with bigger difference within the gender. Alfred Enoch as Wes Gibbins is apparently the least cynical among the lawyers-to-be...

In the plot, at first, the beginning-with-the-end was slightly confusing, but its skillful inclusion inside other, prior events turned out be intriguing - based on the 9 episodes aired so far. In addition, the series contains topics and values not meant for strong conservatives, but hopefully they can be/get over them. If you like suspense with fast changing of events and scenes, and dominating leading performance, then the series is certainly for you.

How to Get Away with Murder is another fine example of the recent trend where TV series have become more interesting than movies, as great directors and performers have begun to work on/in them. I am looking forward to the next episodes already.

PS The plot has similarities with the Swedish series from 1998: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskyldigt_d%C3%B6md , starring Mikael Persbrandt. Highly recommended as well!
