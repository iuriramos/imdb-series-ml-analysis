There is a reason why over 13 million viewers can't wait for Episode 2. Great cast, great lead actor, Viola.

TV has changed. Shonda & ABC are redefining prime-time entertainment. I thought it was going to be impossible to top "Scandal" or even match it. Boy was I wrong. It's becoming obvious that we might be watching a lot of Shondaland TV for the next 4 - 8 years who knows 10 - 12 years even?

And oh the reruns are going to last 2 decades. Great writing. I think ABC should do a documentary on Shonda, her writers and team. How they cast and make such great series when we have been fed with redundant story lines for the last 10 years is amazing

How To Get Away With Murder is a sharp contrast from Scandal. I mean Scandal is supposed to be dark but O boy this is even way darker and twisted ... very twisted. Border line psycho even. Viola's character ... is so well written and dark .. OMG.
