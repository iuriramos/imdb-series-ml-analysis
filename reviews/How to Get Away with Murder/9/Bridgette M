Shonda Rhimes hit the nail on the head with this one! I can usually figure shows/movies out in the first few minutes but this kept my attention and kept me guessing. This isn't the kind of show you wanna take a bathroom break or have interruptions during because you just might miss something. I had to watch it a couple times because I missed a couple of key items. I like the realism of the competitive nature in law school. There are so many twists and turns that it'd be confusing if the plot wasn't so inviting. Professor Keating moves appear to be calculated from start to finish. I think she'll go to the edge of the earth to win in Love or War! You don't wanna miss it! #HTGAWM #TGIT
