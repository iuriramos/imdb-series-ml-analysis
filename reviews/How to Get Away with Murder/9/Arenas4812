Wow, what can I say about this show? It's excellent! Great acting, plot lines, and intrigue with the scripts. Viola Davis does a phenomenal job as Professor Annelise Keating,a "fancy" law professor at Prestigious University A. She uses the schools resources and (I'm assuming) TA's to help her defense team win cases for clients. The students are hungry enough to become the next great investigator, Savior of American law,etc. She chooses a team of several students to help solve crimes. I'm not sure how the series will develop, but this first season's been really good and kept me interested. Annelise's husband dies...but who killed him? Why did he have a mysterious trophy? Why does their relationship seem so strained? I am wondering if they can keep up the pace to this show. Overall, it's worth a watch!
