I really enjoy shows like this one. Shows with an interesting premise and even more interesting characters. One thing this show has that lots of don't? Diversity in the cast. LGBTQ characters. And they're portrayed in the way all characters should be; realistically. This show's got so many twists and turns, it's not just your usual whodunnit type of show, which is pretty amazing because there are way too many of those. I'd never thought I'd be into a legal drama but with the way the plot's set up, it's a no-brainer that I'd like it. 

If you're looking for a show with diversity, gay characters, suspense, drama, and an overall story that keeps you thirsty to tune in every week, please for the love of all that's holy, watch this show. Or don't, but that's on you.
