The most interracial show ever made, seems to be the main theme of the serial. But the plot takes the cherry. The twists through out the story is simply hypnotizing. Even though it is slow at the start, the end pays it off with interest.It seems to have been made with a message of women, gay and other empowerment and is not at all subtle about it. It has Gay sex in every episode..that girls might love. But all these negative points are well outweighed by the the story-line plus acting. Majorly the acting in the lead role "Anna Keating". It is impeccable. I can't remember the last time I failed to identify the killer beforehand. The director would amaze everyone with the brilliant work. "How to get away with murder" there could not be a better title than this.So, watch it right now, bear first few episodes with patience, then drown in its magic. Great Show!!
