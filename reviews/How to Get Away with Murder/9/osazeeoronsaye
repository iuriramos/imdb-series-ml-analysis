I detest long overly detailed reviews so I'll keep this quick. This show had me on the edge every second with little moments of respite. The chronological arrangement and tense soundtrack coupled with the most intelligently crafted plot will have you in cliffhanger mode from the first second to the last. Literally. The acting is superb, it can really connect and engage you as a viewer and keep you glued. I cannot figure anything bad to genuinely say about this show. Greatest thing about the show is how is how the plot develops very quickly and efficiently but you still get a lot of information given it is a 15 episode per season. You will never find a dull period or episode
