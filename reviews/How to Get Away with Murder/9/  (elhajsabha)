I was reluctant in the beginning after reading some reviews to watch this series. After some time I was able to get my self around and start the series. This is now one of my favorite series that I am following and watching closely. I specially do a ritual of making sure every body is sleeping to be able to watch without interruption. Obviously people would criticize that this is not real and do not relate to reel life. But after experience you can never know if part of it is reel true, although this would make you sick to know it is true but the suspense and the twists that are in this series are not expected and clever. I am known between my friends that I always guess what is going to happen in most of the times in movies and series, but this one nevertheless proved me wrong in many cases. This is why I am writing this review to recommend that you watch this amazing series as this is my first ever review.
