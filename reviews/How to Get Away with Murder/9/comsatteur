I was searching for a new TV show to watch because waiting for GoT and OItNB is torture, so I tumbled upon this one. At first I wasn't interested, but when I found out Viola Davis is the prima donna, I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did! I'm going to start with the story, writing and directing. The pilot showed us a promising start. The use of unconventional nonlinear story-telling is intriguing. The script is fast-paced, although sometimes too fast that the narrative impact is often left unfulfilled. Nothing usual with the directions, but altogether everything is working out. I'm not going to lie, there are many plot holes within the story, and the entirety of scenarios are too panned out with the characters. Speaking of the characters, Annalise Keatings is one strong lead. She is the your typical "pro" character with a tough, strong facade and yet shows emotional vulnerability within, but a paragon at that one. The rest of the supporting casts, the students and others aren't as well-built as Annalise but the show is just barely scratching the surface so we'll find out more soon. The cast, dear Lord, the cast is good! Viola Davis' portrayal of Annalise is very transcendent and somehow sublime. Judging by Davis' past roles, like that Oscar-worthy role of the maid in The Help, we can see that she's one of the best and most versatile actresses out there. I'm still annoyed that they cast attractive young people to the other featured roles, but after witnessing that their acting is actually acceptable, above average at best, I didn't have a problem with them afterwards. Overall, the show is worth watching and pursuing. You may find clich√©s and holes in the story, but How to Get Away with Murder can be one of the best shows that will open this season.
