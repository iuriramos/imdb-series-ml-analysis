This program is just genius.. it just keeps getting better and better with each episode.. This has to be by far one of the best TV program I have ever seen.. Murder mystery at it's best.. and Viola Davis and the rest of the actors are all great at their part of the role.. of course there is always the -"pull a rabbit out of the hat" just when things get into a tight knot, but it's so good, you will ignore that bit for sure..!! The only part of the story they smudged up was the murder of Lila Stangard.. In an interview on TV, outside of the show, Viola said that Sam had Lila murdered (as per the episode).. but in the TV episode, they never show who Sam was calling.. he just called someone for a favour.. it could be anything.. so they should have showed it more clearly I think..
