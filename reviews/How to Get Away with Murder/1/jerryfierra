As a lawyer, I was extremely disappointed that nothing this show presents about law school is accurate or even, for that matter, legal. And of course, every law student is an arrogant, narcissistic, nonredeemable idiot. A law professor would never premise a class as showing students how to practice law by focusing on how to acquit a murderer. A law professor would never violate attorney/client privilege by having her students interview a law firm client. Bringing her class into the courtroom to assist her defense, not happening. And on and on. The unfortunate thing is that the undiscriminating viewing audience of typical Shondra Rhimes' crap will eat this all up (and probably believe it is based in fact). This isn't a legal drama, it is juvenilistic pablum that will almost certainly devolve into everyone sleeping with everyone else and something blowing up. Raise the "bar" people!
