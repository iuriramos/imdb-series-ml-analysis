Watched the very first episode all the way through. Halfway through, I knew it was the worse pile of dog pile I had ever witnessed.

1- All the law students are not trying to learn how to defend their clients, they are learning how to break the law in order to get obviously guilty pieces of shite off with murder.

2- The skank law professor has sex with the lead to detective in order to convince him to lie on the stand and convince the jury that the med lab that worked on the evidence flubbed things to frame the defendant.

Yup, that's is right. A dedicated officer of the law lied on the stand for some tail, possibly losing not only his job, but his pension, and giving other defense lawyers an opening to file appeals based on possibly faulty evidence so that other criminals can roam the streets committing more heinous crimes.

3- These stupid, soulless fake students of cheating, lying, and depravity kill someone else, and now they are trying to cover their own effing tracks.

The people who watch this show and love it, have no fricking taste. This show has no place on teevee. I have seen porn and slasher movies that are better than this tripe.
