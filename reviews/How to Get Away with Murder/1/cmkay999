. . . or an accomplice to murder? And everybody cheats on their spouses? This is why I stopped watching Scandal, and I won't be watching any more of this series.

But I really don't understand why I have to post a certain number of words for my review to be accepted. It's ridiculous. Brevity is the soul of wit.

Having to write 10 lines about a show this bad is almost painful. Do you like causing me pain, IMDb? How about a review of you? I've noticed some really bad changes to the site since you were taken over by Amazon, and objectionable company all its own. I guess I won't be visiting your site much, either, from now on.
