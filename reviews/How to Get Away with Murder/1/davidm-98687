Seriously, this show could have been finished in 2 or 3 episodes of a mini series. Murder plots are bad enough when terrible acting is involved (no one in this show has anything glowing about them), so why stretch one murder plot across multiple seasons of a TV series? After the first few episodes, the suspense died down..or should I say murdered. So why are people watching it? There are TV series addicts, and no matter how horrible the show, they will sit there and watch it. True couch potatoes. This show is strictly for couch potatoes. Nothing interesting. Nothing new. You won't learn anything from watching it. Someone, please give this show the ax, meat cleaver, poison, or anything that will put it in it's grave.
