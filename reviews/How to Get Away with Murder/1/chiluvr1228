It may be hard to believe, but there was a time in TV history where  even married couples had to be shown sleeping in single beds. Now it  seems just about anything goes. Where are the censors? How does this  trash get on the air? Sex scenes, oral sex, etc. The TV  censors are letting more and more of this crap be shown. And boy is  this show confusing. 
I like Viola Davis so gave this show a try and I wish I hadn't. She  plays a ruthless defense attorney who teaches a class on how to be a  great defense attorney. 
While this lawyer & professor (Annalise) is upset about her husband's  supposedly infidelity, she was unfaithful herself. Nobody has any kind  of morals on this show; not the lawyer, cop or students. 
Possible spoiler I missed the pilot episode so I'm a little confused  about what is going on with her students. Did they kill someone and are  trying to cover it up? Did her husband have an affair and then kill one  of his students? No idea and I don't care as I will never watch this  garbage again. If you have any kind of morals or sense of propriety,  this is not the show for you.
