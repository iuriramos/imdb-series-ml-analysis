This show sucks. Badly. The ensemble is terrible acting. The writing is hacky. And viola davis is good but her emmy win was undeserving when compared to tatiyana maslany in orphan black. Davis is best part of show but they focus on the ensemble of young 90210 students and their dumb dramas. Th he plot and dialogue is clich√©. The music anf tone sucks for a crime drama. The whole thing wreaks. Shonda rhimes keeps getting praisr for making garbage just like greys anatomy. Its like reviewers and critics are all dumb flaky fans who know nothing about writing and acting and directing. Like if the bar of reviewing Bieber was all tween girls. Bizarre that all the idiots drown out reason that this sjow sucks. I have no idea how or why it has an 8.2 rating. Reading other reviews it seems clear that most people find it flaky. I think this 8.2 rating is either rigged or being blindly voted by muddle aged women and black people.
