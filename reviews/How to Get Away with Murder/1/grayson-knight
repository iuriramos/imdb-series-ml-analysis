If you went to law school and/or an attorney, this is IMPOSSIBLE to watch. While a number of other movies and television shows allow you to separate from reality when legal concepts present themselves (or attempt to stay accurate) this show is sooooo ludicrous it is impossible to take seriously. It is aggravating and completely off base. You would have to be almost brain dead to buy into this writing. The acting is okay, and Viola Davis is great, as usual. However, the concept of the show and the writing attempts to market the premise as real, but it is so far from reality it is impossible to take it seriously. If you are familiar with law and the legal profession at all, stay away!
