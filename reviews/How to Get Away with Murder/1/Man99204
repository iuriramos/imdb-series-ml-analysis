Absurb Pile of Cr--

This may be the most poorly written program of the 2014 Season. It is so bad it will make your teeth hurt.

I went to Law School. The actual experience is absolutely nothing like this turgid melodrama. 

Viola Davis poses her way through every scene wallowing in every melodramatic moment after another. Law Professors simply do not act like this. Davis lacks the personal authority to effectively play this role. 

Watch this programs now - it will not be around by mid season.
