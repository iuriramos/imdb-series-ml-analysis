The lack of morals by lawyers implied by the title "How to Get Away with Murder", and taking the perspective of the guilty really would be a GREAT plot, but sadly it's not this show.

Instead we see an angry black woman playing at some sort of fantasy law that's so out there it literally makes you cringe, even if your aren't a lawyer, she walks like an angry tranny and talks much the same way, and she really seems like she has some sort of IQ problem in comparison to the the rest of her profession.

She teaches law, and get's a LOT of help from her students regarding actual cases with little regard to what is realistic or proper for their profession, and she does it all angrily. There is a lot of minorities in the show, and like everything else they get that surreal treatment, where everyone is portrayed so over the top that their personalities become almost cartoonish. It's just unengaging. I wish they would have stayed closer to an actual plot instead of this overacted soap filler.
