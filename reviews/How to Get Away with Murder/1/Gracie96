This show won't last the full season. Jumping back and forth between the future and the past is difficult to follow, and not an easy progression like in other shows (i.e., Person of Interest).

The characters are too over the top and not very likable (i.e., the gay male, the black student who gets into the class at the last minute, the snooty know-it-all student, etc.). Viola Davis is a good actress, but she is not John Houseman (The Paper Chase)--in fact a remake of The Paper Chase would be a better option than watching this show. The two sex scenes (gay and straight) were unnecessary.

I won't give this show a second chance because it's just plain awful.
