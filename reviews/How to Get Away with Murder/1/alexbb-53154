LOL - wondering about the viewers who give this show a good rating...

It's a really awful and dumb show with spoiled, whining women, cheating men and stupid and sometimes illegal twists to win the cases - but not in an entertaining way.

Each character is more obnoxious than the next, worst of all - in each episode, women are either cruel or crying and accusing, or both - it's a real pain to watch them act, talk and always complain or cry or demand or accuse or lie or cheat... - seems like the show was created by a very unhappy divorced wife to get her anger out...

And the best thing - the only half-decent character in this show is killed - LOL 

Not recommended.
