This show has the ability to be a really good crime show, but spends too much time going back and forth from present to past, etc.. I stopped the show during the VERY graphic and unnecessary gay sex scene. Totally offensive! Any sex scene that graphic is not OK for network television. A truly well written and produced show doesn't need filth to draw people in. Producers and writers should watch The Blacklist to learn a few things. The actress who plays Voila Davis is a fantastic actress however she is sidelined. Would have like to see more of her involvement. Also, it's unfortunate that the strong female figure is flanked with infidelity and a poor moral compass. Overall, a disappointing experience with the show that I was really excited to see!
