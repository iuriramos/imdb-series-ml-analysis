As a Philly native and an attorney, I truly wanted to enjoy this show. Unfortunately I just cannot force myself to get into it. I do not know where to begin with my disgust with this program. It is the furthest thing not only from law school, but from the actual practice of law. The law professor would be fired from her teaching position almost immediately for a number of reasons. Furthermore, the law professor would also be disbarred in every episode I've seen so far. I thought Franklin & Bash and Suits were insulting to attorneys, however this show is an utter disgrace to the legal community. 

I find it humorous how the only bad reviews about this show are coming from attorneys or law school students. That should give an idea of how bad this show really is.
