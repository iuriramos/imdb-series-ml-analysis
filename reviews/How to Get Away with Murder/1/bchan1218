I decided for check this program out after Viola Davis won the Emmy for this new show. I only watched the first episode and utterly hated it. I gave it the whole episode to see if it got better. I don't know why she would have gotten an award. I instantly disliked her character, I found her totally demeaning to women, lawyers and humans. She gave a moving speech while accepting her Emmy, this horrible show doesn't reflect well. It was too jumpy, to hard to believe, not one redeemable character. People at their worst. I would not want her as a lawyer, especially having her students in on her case. And a contest to see who will help her. Awarding one who knows her secrets! Previous reviewers who are lawyers say no way this would happen. Shouldn't we be showing lawyers in a better light? Are there no better movies/TV for Miss Davis's talents? Her Oscar was well-deserved, the Emmy was not. I found her to be over-acting throughout the entire episode. I think this often happens, either over doing it or completely wooden. And again, yes, I saw just the one, my husband agreed that was all we could take of this program.
