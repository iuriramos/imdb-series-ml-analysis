For anyone over 60, this show is very similar to the movies shown at the drive-in theater any summer weekend evening back in the 1970's. People would pay to get into the drive-in theater, but they wouldn't go to actually watch that crap, if you get what I mean. Maybe you don't. I can't believe network TV is presenting this stuff as innovative entertainment. It was sleazy junk back then and it's sleazy junk now. The only difference is this generation was raised by puritanical, former sex and drug fiends, so they think this is cutting edge. Listen kids, you only think you like it because it's abnormal and shocking, but it isn't anything new or edgy, it's crap.
