If you are student of Annalise Keating you probably won't learn any law but one thing for sure you will soon become murderer. By the way I have probably better knowledge of USA law even if I never visited US, nor learn their law system and - as you can clearly see - my English is not even close to be good. Unfortunately even great actress cannot hide lack of decent material; they didn't write anything close to the level of e.g. weakest episodes of "Good Wife"; so to project credibility she quite often just shout and of course every judge is easily convinced by her because we all know that logic always loose with scream. There is not single innocent character in this drama and worst of all is A. K. I just hope she will end up behind bars. Sooner the better.
