I have some great ideas for future Shondra Rhimes shows: soft-core porn in a fire station; soft-core porn in a gift shop; soft-core porn in a high school (I sure there would be no moral aversion in Shondraland); soft-core porn in the military; soft-core porn in a cemetery; soft-core porn in a Prius; soft-core porn in a drug store; soft-core porn in a gun shop; soft-core porn in a ballet company; soft-core porn at Disneyland; soft-core porn in a swimming pool; soft-core porn in a tree-house; soft-core porn at the laundromat; soft-core porn in the middle of the street. Just a few suggestions for a person famous for innovative, original ideas that capture the intellectual curiosity of the American public.
