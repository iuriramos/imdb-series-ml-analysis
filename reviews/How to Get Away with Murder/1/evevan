I like Viola Davis and I was so looking forward to this TV show. So disappointed that such graphic scenes were flashed before our unsuspecting eyes. Very disappointed. ABC is owned by Disney, is it not? I do not believe that Walt Disney would have approved. What a shame. Good lawyer shows are few and far between.

The few actual law references upon which the show is based are few and far between. The criminality with which young college students appear to be involved is a put-off. 

Early on we are exposed to oral sex, adultery on the part of the main character, gay sex scene and beyond that I do not know because it was too revolting for me to continue to watch.
