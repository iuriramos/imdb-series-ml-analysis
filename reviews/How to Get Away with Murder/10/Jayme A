I am very surprised at how many negative reviews this show has received, however having read through these I am of the opinion that many of those reviewers are reactionary and extremely right wing. Judging this show on it's sex scenes/shock moments fails to appreciate its intelligence, and the level of suspense which has been maintained from the first episode. It is so unusual to find a show which keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout each episode. So many legal dramas become formulaic and predictable very early on, this is so not the case with How to Get Away With Murder. I am also appalled that so many reviewers seemed so upset by the inclusion of homosexual sex scenes. Surely we should not allow intolerance to inform our judgement of a great show!
