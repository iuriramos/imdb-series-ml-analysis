Can i just say that so far (after one episode) i think this show is amazing and has a lot of potential to be a hit. 

Unlike so many shows these days that have mildly entertaining pilot's and take a few episodes/half a season to get hooked, i was hooked after about 3 minutes of this show. 

It's a fresh idea about Law students and their Criminal Law professor who teaches a class about how to defend a client who is up for murder and win. I wont say much more than that because i don't want to spoil anything for you. 

Definitely worth watching even if Law shows aren't usually your thing. 

Some people may say it's not realistic but perhaps thats a good thing, i thought it was clever and entertaining and really isn't that what TV shows are suppose to be?
