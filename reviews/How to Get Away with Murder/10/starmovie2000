OMG! I can't keep my eyes on it. It is incredible, how great any story match perfectly into another. At the beginning it look like one of those series who would be like any other student story's! But no way, of course it is a law thing but by the same time it is better than any crime or law series. It is so hard not to spoiler, just watch it, you will totally love and enjoy it. The first thing what I want to see in the morning is, what's next. Of course it is odd to see an over sexual guy, but everyone knows, it is "normal" but we never get it, or want to know. The pressure between the characters are perfectly done, the way anyone freak out is so natural. I am repeating, sorry for that, but watch it. I totally love & recommend
