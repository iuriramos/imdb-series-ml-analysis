For starters its the first time for me to be not be provoked by a dialogue at any point in the show. Unfortunately for most show on TV/Cable the dialogue lacks sense as if those characters on the show are awkward and won't talk to each others disregarding their relationship; example would be Breaking Bad (too much angry reactions which could've been simply avoided by a simple to moderate conversation) But HERE in how to get away with murder the characters talk to each others, a spot on dialogue. The Drama is focused, conflicts are well organized, no exaggerated sex scenes, the acting is brilliant, and the treatment of the scenario is super, there is no passive incidents in this show. Awesome arch, and again for me the fact that there's a perfect reasonable dialogue I can make a whole sense of whatever is happening and for almost the first time, Minimal or none plot holes!

AND VIOLA DAVIS!
