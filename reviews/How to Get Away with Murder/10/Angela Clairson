I am a lawyer myself and really love the show. People saying it's not realistic obviously know nothing about law practice/how the world works...Of course it's glamorous/shocking and over the top, otherwise no one would be watching. Good acting, nice plots and also groundbreaking new area's like gay sex (really don't understand all the haters while other series have loads of hetero sex), nicely and sexy done! Hurray for Jack Falahee for nailing his role! Maybe it's because I'm from Europe and we're not that hypocrite here....but really, wake up to the new! Shonda Rimes is obviously attacking many (US?) taboos and doing a great job putting an older black woman in charge of the show, with her sexuality intact, Viola Davis is brilliant.
