if you want to make a series a masterpiece take all the ingredients of this show and there you have it. The narratives, suspense, and twists blow me away. The second season is just as good as the first. Shonda Rhimes owns story telling right now on ABC and is in her prime. This show is a major gut punch for the week to week viewer with its dramatic cliffhangers. Im not going to get into the premise I'm writing more about the second season and how it doesn't disappoint and instead has twists and turns galore. don't miss this show. its so captivating and engrossing i absolutely love it. i don't know how the writers did it but they created 2 seasons of a masterpiece.
