I honestly couldn't believe how many bad reviews this show got. Yes its very unrealistic but its also suspenseful and exciting. Yes, there are some very awkward sex scenes but most things on TV do now. That being said I find myself craving the next episode every time one ends. Its kind of nice to watch a show you know there wont be a happy ending to. Its different and crazy and i think thats what makes it so great. Most shows having to do with the law are about catching the bad guy, but this show is about the bad guy and you find yourself sort of rooting for them. hopefully most people realize lawyers aren't getting their assistants to kill people off for them, but it does make for some interesting twists.
