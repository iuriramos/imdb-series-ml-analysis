Look, I'm just going to get straight to the point. I love, love, love this show. what's not to like? It's humorous, dangerous, exciting, unique and the actors are fantastic. I don't think another lead would have been as wonderful as Viola Davis is playing this completely flawed character that is more hard on her self then people give her credit for. I mean the character is a complete mess on a human perspective, but just like the rest of us, who here isn't a mess? 

People have been moaning that the law she teaches is not realistic. so what!? it's a TV show, it's science fiction, not real life. so just enjoy it!. the story lines are captivating, they're exciting, and they always leave you wanting more.

no complaints from me as a viewer. I give it 10/10 and if i could give it more i would.
