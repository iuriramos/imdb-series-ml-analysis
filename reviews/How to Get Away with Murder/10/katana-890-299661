Let me just say, Spoiler OK, SPOILER!

This latest episode rocked my mind- OK I nearly got up out of my seat and leaped into the TV screen.....

When Viola's character (Im so excited I cant think) Is at the end of the episode, and she is sitting in front of her mirror she takes off a wig.

Im like, oh---- OK....She wars a wig, whatever- People do that.

Then she starts taking off her eye lashes and Im like wait a sec....

Does she have cancer?

then she starts to remove her makeup- and there is a LOT of black showing up on the wash cloth- And Im thinking as I rise up from my chair- IS SHE WHITE?????? What????!!!

Then oh my lord- I think...Wait..........is SHE A MAN??!?!?!? IS SHE A MAN>>???

Oh my lord- This episode made me so crazy it was amazing!!!!!!
