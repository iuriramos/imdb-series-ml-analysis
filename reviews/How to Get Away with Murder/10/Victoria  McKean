this TV series has got me hooked, it's an absolute thriller. have read a few reviews and would suggest not to judge characters based on previous performances! after the first episode I could not get my eyes off the screen, highly recommend this series. such am emotional and dramatic roller coaster, very scandalous and enjoyable! the basis of the story is taken a little bit out of context, once you get past that it is very enticing! at first it can be quite confusing gradually it makes more sense and has most definitely, easily become my new favourite on TV at this point in time! throughout the episodes there is a lot of unexpected situations! Whilst watching this do remember that what happens on TV isn't always true, but it's not a bad thing to have an imagination and enjoy yourself a little! again, highly recommend it!
