When I first started watching this show, I thought it was truly horrible. The only thing that kept me coming back was hoping that the storyline would get better and the characters would become more in depth and sympathetic. I had gotten used to watching another kind of show that it took me a while to "get" this one. Yes, as other reviewers have pointed out, you have to make this a sort of fantasy story in your mind, because it would and could never happen in real life. Once you do that, just keep watching. The show really becomes great in the last 4 to 5 episodes. If you love crime stories with twists and a dose of humor, then I think that you will love this show. The second half of the season, the story did become more interesting, and the characters became people who you care about (not to say you will like them, but you will want to see what happens to them). I'm looking forward to season 2.
