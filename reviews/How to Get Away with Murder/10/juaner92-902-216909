yeah the first 3 or 4 episodes are slow and have some repetitive things but if u r patience it start to take u and is great! how the match the classes with real cases and with the real problem. OMG is fantastic! really good! i love the main character great actress! Also i love the passion scenes, there are for all the tastes gays and straight also the different kind of personalities make the series very interesting, because you cant know what will each character do after each problem. is like a battle between each one, and things u think u know change in a blink of a second. You cant miss and episode, cause u will be loose. i hope there will be more that 3 seasons or at least 3 with a good end!
