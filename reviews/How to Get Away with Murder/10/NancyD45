One of the best things on TV this year. Viola Davis is astonishing and is the glue of the entire show: she is mesmerizing in her role and is both a bold and strong female lead. This is the first time I have seen her acting and I must say I was blown away. Supporting cast members are a little awkward in the first episodes. However as time progressed, the plot thickened and the characters came alive halfway through the season. Jack Falahee is great, and so is Alfred Enoch, but what makes me love this show is definitely the suspense elements it has in every episode. You learn something new in every one, like finding a puzzle piece under the couch that you didn't know you had before. Every episode opens up a new part of the whole picture, and when you find out the ending, you're in for a surprise. And ladies... Charlie Weber?!? Need I say more?!? What are you doing still reading this review! Go turn on your television and tune into the crazy thrill ride that is HTGAWM!!!
