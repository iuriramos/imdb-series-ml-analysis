I think that no one has not done anything like this to would be comparable to this series.

This is a incredibly good , great acting, the story is very interesting with permanent plots and resolution, everything is in its place without any exaggeration, and where has it does not matter. I'm picky person, and nothing does not hold my attention for a long time, but this one left me speechless.

When you're done episode immediately have a desire to continue. I look forward to further development of the series.

I think this is nothing but a masterpiece, and I can not wait for the third season and I look forward to every new advance, because It would be bad to interrupt this masterpiece.
