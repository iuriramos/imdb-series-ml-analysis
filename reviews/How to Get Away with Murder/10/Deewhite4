How To Get Away With Murder is the best show on TV. Viola Davis is phenomenal! She looks great and really owns the role as a powerful attorney. The young cast members are holding their own as well. Week after week I stay up well past my bedtime to watch this show. If you have not seen this show, you do not know what you are missing. I implore you if you want a very captivating drama series this is the show to watch. You will not be disappointed. The plot continues to deepen. It is a true whodunnit in the sense of the word. I sit at the edge of my seat biting my nails trying to figure out what will happen next. This show keeps getting better and better. I am hooked!
