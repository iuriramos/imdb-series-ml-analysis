The premise of this show is a spin on the law dramas of old but told in a new way. The characters are so different with secrets that are quite shocking. The actors play these very intense roles with remarkable believability. Best of all Viola Davis because her character is a mix of hard edged Black Woman and a truly disturbed emotional wreck. She does it so well I would be upset if there is no Emmy recognition. This is exciting writing with excellent acting. I love this show. If you are looking for a TV thriller that is like a page turner book- This is it. ABC has got something here and it is my hope that they keep it coming. Good luck to the show.
