You are a team of lawyers and you have manipulated the law all your life. You have proved guilty people innocent and vice- versa. And one day, you commit a crime by murdering someone. You know the law in and out so you know what you're getting your hands into. You get away with murder. That's how to get away with murder for you. The plot, the screenplay, the direction, the performance delivered by the actors is spot on. The storyline in the first season is so great that it'll leave you restless by the end of it. I couldn't sleep for a week, without thinking about it. It left me scarred and traumatized. You must not miss out on this one. You can't not say that your mind has boggled.
