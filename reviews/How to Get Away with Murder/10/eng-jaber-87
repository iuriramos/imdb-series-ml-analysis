I don't understand all the bad reviews surrounding this show. It's a very entertaining show full with mystery, backstabbing, drama and so much more. Some talked about the sex scenes. what era are you from people? it is innocent network sex scenes. This show got me hooked from the very first episode. great cast and the lead actress should be at least nominated for an Emmy. if that didn't happen hen there is something wrong with this world. Highly recommended for viewers whom like courtroom drama and a touch of mystery in their show. This show got me to start an IMDb account just to write this review. This should be enough to tell you how good this show is. Hopefully it stays on TV for a very long time. A+
