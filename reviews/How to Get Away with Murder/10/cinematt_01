I'm loving everything about it so far. Viola is amazing and the students were very well cast. The show is very inclusive of all types without resorting to clich√©s or stereotypes (which isn't to say they aren't realistically portrayed). Early fave is Connor (played by Jack Falahee). Even in their few scenes together, Connor & his "not-boyfriend" feel more real to me than most gay couples currently on TV. As for the other students, I'm looking forward to finding out more about them. It's not a reality-based study of law and I fully accept that. I'm along for the ride. It moves at a fast pace yet still allows time for character development. Can't say the show is for everyone, but it's at the top of my Can't-Miss List.
