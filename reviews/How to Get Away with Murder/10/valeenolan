Well, I am not an attorney so my view is not clouded by what is real or accurate. Frankly, I don't care. I absolutely love this show because it hooks me at the end of each episode, every single time. It does not have to be real or accurate for me because I just want to be entertained and that it does for me. I watch television to be entertained not to compare what it is like in the real world....Sometimes, I do not want to be in the real world, lol. I love Annalise and all the characters but I have to wonder what will happen once the flashbacks catch up to the modern episode. Will the show be over or will another 5 students take their place? Pleeeeease keep this show on the air.
