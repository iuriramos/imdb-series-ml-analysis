I started watching, because of Scandal, another of my favorite shows, so when I heard that creators of it make another show i was curious. As almost with every show we had a rough beginning, but now, as I watched half of a season, I started to love it. This show will definitely surprise anyone, nothing is really obvious. I don't know if it's accurate from the legal point of view, cause I'm not familiar with it, but for me it doesn't matter. I like the depth of almost every character, the more time we watch, the more we know about every single one of them, their backstories are really interesting. I strongly recommend watching it!
