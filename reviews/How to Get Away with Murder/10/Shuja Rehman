I have watched so many shows over the time that i can't even find to relate to it. The story line, the perfection in execution, acting, suspense ...ahh God knows i am short of words!

Right from the beginning how the story revolves around one lawyer, then her students and their own lives.... Superb

Moreover it has got story, not like the seasons which are merely dragging the story and the audience with new entries and exceptions thrown for them specifically. 

LOL again if you are watching it for law class and justification of justice system in your country.
