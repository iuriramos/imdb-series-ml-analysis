If you think that any of the subjects listed above would make for a good suspense court room murder mystery drama, then you absolutely must watch the (surprise) ABC drama "How to Get Away With Murder. I cannot stress enough how intriguing, exciting and suspenseful this series is, I also cannot explain it any sort of conventional sense, there is simply too much enticing surprises and intricately woven plot devices and subjects to even try to adequately describe this series. The best I can do is to say that there are multiple story lines and plots all interconnected, and many of them are non linear switching from one mystery to another.
