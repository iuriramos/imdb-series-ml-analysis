The directors, actors, writers, everything about this series is just WOW. Absolutely worth your time. I first watched Viola Davis from the help and from there she became on the top of my list of the best actresses ever, that's why I decided to watch this show and absolutely I was not disappointed and it actually surpassed all my expectations. Viola Davis is a beast. She definitely is. Her acting is superb, real and captivating. Without her I don't think this show would be as great as it is now.

The series is full of twists. Well, UNPREDICTABLE TWISTS. It lives to saying, EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED.
