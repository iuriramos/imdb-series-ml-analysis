Oh my God! What is this? This is Full Blowing Phenomena. And as this, it can either be totally irking or totally loooooooooved. But there's no way one can not feel about this! First and foremost because of Viola Davis!! Viola Davis is making history in the genre. She is so many things, she goes through so many states, that you cannot unsee a whole range of her acting abilities. She is stunning. The whole cast is so well balanced, it is a pleasure to see them again and again. And if you love mystery and are good at letting your imagination go, you are gonna be HOOKED.

Now consider the specific times in which this is happening : Viola Davis in this show is making more to Honor black actors and actresses but also to Honor the history of the black community than any actual formal speech.

Also this series deals with real people, so if you have a hard time acknowledging that you have flaws and that no one is perfect, this show is not for you. Life gets messy sometimes, guys. If you wanna take a wild ride into it, watch this!

With love, Leila.
