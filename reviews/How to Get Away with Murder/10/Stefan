Finally I managed to watch this show and have to say: wow! I'm overwhelmed! I went to law school in Germany as well and don't understand why American lawyers write these bad reviews. I learned, that READING and UNDERSTANDING what was read is fundamental. This show is a drama show and fictional. How come people who studied to become lawyers don't see the difference between fictional drama and documentary? Who in the world would watch a show as boring as law studies are in real life? After two minutes everyone would have fallen asleep.

Not with HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER. The concept is awesome, I find similarities in many of the characters (which by far aren't just selfish idiots!). Competition, self-esteem, loss, betrayal, still the urge to trust someone... We all have to deal with topics like these - and if they are presented in a fascinating, sexy, well- written and beautifully photographed way - then I call it PERFECT ENTERTAINMENT.
