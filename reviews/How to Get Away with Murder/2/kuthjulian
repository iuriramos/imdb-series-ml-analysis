Casting from Barney ( one of everything), formulaic episode structure concerning case of the day ( as bad as Shark), annoying flashbacks , worst possible gay stereotype and just poor legal arguments. If you weren't sure why people don't like lawyers, watch just about any episode. If you enjoy sudoku, then you might enjoy trying to following the love interests of all involved, but only if you are not very good at it. If you have some brain power then you will probably have stopped watching. Sometimes you watch a second episode thinking it has to get better (Sleepy Hollow)and finding out it doesn't.You may get sucked in to wondering who did what to whom and why, but even if you are tired after a day of studying (obviously adults will not be watching this), you are better off watching almost anything else. Simply dreadful
