This was a great show until season 3 where I think they must have hired a new writer because the forced anti white script is just hard to listen. Constantly white people are called out and called derogatory terms for absolutely no reason. Constantly there is instances where the racist narrative doesn't belong but some writer just had to slip in a comment about white people. At one point a black character says "I don't want to waste my time teaching you how to get rid of your white habits". There is also mystery part where we as an audience don't know who is causing problems for one of the black characters but other black characters instantly say "the person must be white trying to smear a black women's career". Really?? Where is all this coming from. When I started watching this I loved the cast as it featured a multicultural cast without any forced racism but in season 3 it's some how because extremely racist against white people.
