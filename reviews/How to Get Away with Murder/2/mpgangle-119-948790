I wanted to like this. I really, really did. After about five minutes, though, I looked at my husband and said, "I am finding it hard to suspend my disbelief." He replied, "I am, too." The premise is interesting to me: a complex, strong, female law professor and her students tackle ambiguously moral subject matter. But the acting was heavy-handed. Without spoiling anything, there was a scene in which one of the actors changes mood abruptly, which came off more psychopathic than complex. I don't think that was the intention. There was subtlety neither in the acting nor in the directing. There were things that would have been more interesting in allusion rather than in hitting us over the head with graphic imagery. And I know a little about the law (disclaimer: not an attorney), enough to know that very little of the legal stuff was realistic. Reading the other reviews here confirms this. In fact, it was so unrealistic that I just couldn't get past the liberties taken in order to advance the plot. It seems to me that a better director would have known her craft well enough to understand other devices with which to move the story forward, without cheap reinvention of reality. I should actually retitle my review; I didn't make it through the whole hour.
