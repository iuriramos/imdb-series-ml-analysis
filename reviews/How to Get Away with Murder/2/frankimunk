I was expecting this to be great after all the hype with previews, then came episode one, which being utter nonsense at 100mph, I chalked up to hubris for being deliberately over the top because maybe it was intentional so that they might pull in viewers.

I thought after a few episodes it will calm down and become watchable, but sadly not so. It just went from awful to ridiculous. Absurd plots and story lines.

I've heard talk of 'Person Of Interest' being cancelled, yet I've loved that show every episode from the pilot, if they can canx a good show like that, but air shows like this I despair.

I think even the Title is sensationally contrived in order to bring in viewers, after all 'How To Get Away With Murder' is quite the grab, but the show needs to improve and become plausible pdq or it will fail.

As for Viola Davis' maniacal acting, it's like she's insane and is infecting these students with her insane behaviour! I don't mean to be disrespectful but her mad acting seems to be set the tone, 

When I watch it I feel the need like saying calm down already! The actress Lisa Well is still playing Paris Geller-her character in 'Gilmore Girls'!

Shut it down and put the money and resources into another show more deserving.

I'm not watching anymore, as of episode 6 I can't hack it, it wears me out! If there are people who do enjoy it, I don't understand why... Give all the students a trophy and say goodbye ðŸ‘‹ please...
