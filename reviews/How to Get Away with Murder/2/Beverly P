Was watching this while it was the solving of a mystery. Done now! Last couple of shows nothing but EVERYONE exploring their gayness or discussing 8 hour orgasms. Come on! This is not realistic and just tells me the writers have nothing more to offer. Everything on TV does not need to reflect around this one politically correct issue. I get it! Some people are gay but it doesn't have to be the basis of every show. In my career, I have never sat in a room and discussed my sexual habits with all of my co- workers but I can see why we have issues at our large hospital with employees who think this is the way people actually communicate. This was a group of talented actors that you have now taken off course. No more! Moving on!
