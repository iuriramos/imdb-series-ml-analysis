I'll be honest, I still watch it, not because I enjoy it, but really because my girlfriend is sort of a television fascist. I watch what she watches until I get too bored, or frustrated, and run off to the bedroom with a book or a tiny laptop screen. There is no compromise with Millennial viewing habits.

So I've seen enough to know that I've already seen this. It's almost a procedural, as in it fits nicely in the mold that so many other television shows today do.

NCIS? Elementary? SVU? Law and Order? It doesn't matter, seriously it doesn't, in shows like this you can take the dialogue from just about any lead character, give it to just about any other lead character...in this show or any other like it...and it will still make perfect sense.

You've seen most of the characters before. You have heard variations of the dialogue so often you could write it yourself. You've seen the drama. You've seen the canned character flaws added to make the cardboard cut outs seem mildly different. You've even seen the plot twists coming when they happened four years ago on the show you liked that was almost just like this one.

In fact, if you are watching it and enjoying it, it's probably because you probably don't react well to change and have a deep craving for mediocre redundancy.
