I started watching this show expecting something really interesting. Unfortunately, I didn't notice it was a Shonda Rhimes vehicle; I had disliked her previous series, "Scandal" and many of the things I disliked crept into this show as well.

Having watched two episodes, I am considering giving up on it already. The flashbacks are repetitive, although they vary slightly to reveal new aspects of the "murder" so you don't dare fast-forward through all the stuff you saw before in case you miss the new reveal. This is like watching the apple tree in your back yard for months in the hope you will get an edible apple before the birds and bugs ruin it.

I've never been to law school or worked as a lawyer, but the courtroom scenes just don't ring true for me. Pulling rabbits out of hats belongs in a magic act, and it's just overused in legal drama.

And finally, IMDb, I have an ID and a password - why in $%^&&%% do you also need me to fill in a Captcha? Do you think people are skewing the reviews and ratings with robots?
