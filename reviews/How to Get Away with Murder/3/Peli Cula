I was quite curious when I heard about this new TV show as I really enjoy crime stories. No need to say that I am deeply disappointed. 

I find the characters portrayal quite superficial and overly dramatic. Moreover, the crime story which is supposed to be the main plot is stretched over and over again throughout the episodes. On top of that, you can add poor dialogues... and there you have it : an unrealistic show that is impossible to watch! I cannot relate to or just like any character. At some point, I simply decided to give up. 

However, I feel really insulted because it seems that some creators just take the first idea that pops into their minds and try to turn it into a 'serie' deprived of substance. If you don't know what I am referring to, you can also check Scandal (from Shonda R. again...).
