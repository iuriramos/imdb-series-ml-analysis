The show should be re-named, "How To Get Away With Having Sex Everywhere." 

I honestly think all the sex scenes are due to poor writing skills. Many shows are able to fill an hour without having any or few. 

There is much less focus on the law cases than who is sleeping with who, where and when, but this is typical of this producer's shows.

Too much filler due to writer's not being able to come up with enough material. 

How many times do we need to see the lead character in bed with her co-star in the same show? I counted at least 3 in ONE show. Good grief.
