Having watched Shonda Rhime's Grey's Anatomy, I was kind of expecting a lot of drama with How to Get Away with Murder. However, having watched several episodes, I'm not liking the way the legal system is being portrayed nor am I enjoying the unnecessary scenes that act as a filler to the script. 

Though I'm fascinated by the cast and what is actually happening, I think the storyline could move along much faster than it's current state, and that can be rectified by focusing on the quality of script and dialogue instead of attracting more shock-and-awe attention at every possible moment, especially with the overdose on sexual scenes and illegal activities of Keating's law students. 

It's extremely far-fetched to have the legal system portrayed as such, and a classroom being taught by a lawyer/professor who teaches her students how to be "good" lawyers. It's ridiculous, and the combined talents of all the great actors and actresses on this show are not enough to save the series if it continues on like this.

The most intriguing part of the storyline is the murder plot, which you can only see snippets of in each episode. That's what's keeping me going. But overall, it's not the greatest show and I highly doubt I will keep watching after we all figure out the outcome of the murder plot. 

If you're into a whole bunch of pointless, far-fetched drama and filler sex scenes that push your boundaries, then How to Get Away with Murder might tickle your fancy. If not, then either stay tuned to see whodunit or give up watching as the show's not going to change.
