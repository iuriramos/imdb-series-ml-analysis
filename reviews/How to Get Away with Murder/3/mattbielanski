This series takes place in an alternate universe where the US never developed the 5th amendment, rules of evidence, or any other common aspect of our legal system. At least, I hope that's the case. 

If that's NOT the case, then this is the most poorly-researched legal drama in television history (a history that is riddled with poorly- researched legal dramas, mind you). If a character is being portrayed as a "brilliant" lawyer or law student, then they should be demonstrating at least a basic knowledge of our legal system. None of the characters in this series do that at any time.

It's probably a great show if you got a "D" in your high school government class or can otherwise block out any knowledge you have about how criminal law works in the US.
