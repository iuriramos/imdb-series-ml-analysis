I love shows that give a person reason to think and this doesn't do that and honestly the people are not likable. Only one of the elected team is really likable. The other's are largely stereotypical which isn't interesting. I personally do not want explicit info on something that happens to someone's A-hole. How is that about criminal justice? The concept of the show offers many interesting possibilities but it gets bogged down and misses the boat in my estimation. I gave this show a couple tries to like it because I'm a mystery fan. I hope something will be done to make this more of a cerebral adventure and give the viewing audience characters with some character.
