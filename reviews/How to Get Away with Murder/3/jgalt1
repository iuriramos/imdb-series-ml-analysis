Like many shows on any network, it has a cast with lots of pretty people. For that, you start with a 3 rating.

I was warned .... Shonda Rhimes created it. Why I would think this would be any better than the unwatchable "Grey's Anatomy" or "Scandal", I have no idea. A fan of Viola Davis, I gave it a chance.

I feel very sad for her. Such talent and to have it wasted on pablum like this ... ugh! The sad excuse for dialog on this show -- it's painful to hear desperately try and yet fail to bring life to any of it.

It gets a .5 point for having a queer major character who, God bless him, isn't your standard limp-wrist excuse for a life form that most shows, if they even have queer characters, usually feature. But, like many of the major characters in Rimes' shows, he is a fatally flawed, manipulative bastard.

So, I now I know for sure. If Shonda Rhimes is attached, run, run for your life. Even the dreadful "The Haves and Have Nots", Tyler Perry's trash on OWN, is preferable. Aaron O'Connell (can't act his way out of paper bag -- not alone in this cast, unfortunately) is shirtless in at least every other episode. And, unlike the boys on HTGAWM, he is all ink-free muscle.
