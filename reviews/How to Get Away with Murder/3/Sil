The series, which conceptually is a badly disguised Dr. House meet the good housewife rip-off, disappoints on so many levels: - A little suspension of disbelief as the price to pay for entertainment is fine, why must some producers/scriptwriters insist on outlandish retarded plots with zero credibility? - The main plot that last for so many episodes is A. remarkably unoriginal and uninteresting. B. Shows the almost infinite laziness of the producer, trying to make it interesting by showing small playbacks each episodes, so that the viewer is tortured by being force-fed the same boring sequences again and again and again and again. That's a fantastic way to amortize a cheap production financially, but what about the sanity cost for the viewers? - You will not mistake the cases with those of the good wife, as most of them are uninteresting and you end-up the episode wondering if you learned anything. - Not sure if the scriptwriters or Viola Davis are responsible for the atrocious Keating character, so far from the brilliance of a Dr. House, and more whiny and crying than a baby - while supposed to be a fear inspiring lawyer, boss and teacher.

The disappointment is all the more bigger because the cast isn't bad, because the law is complex enough to be the source of many interesting cases and because group dynamics could make for interesting situations.
