I looked forward to this show's start last season after seeing the repeated ads for it all summer in 2014. The premiere left me confused as to how Rhimes was going to handle the rest of the season. Was it going to be filled with flashbacks without ever laying the groundwork for the characters' personalities? Not once did I develop any long interest in what happened to the roles the actors portrayed. None of the characters were ever fully developed, thus leaving nothing for the viewer to care about. 

Each episode there was a case quickly solved but the murders still seemed to take precedence over the courtroom drama. The ideas behind the legal cases could have been developed further, showing how the young wannabe attorneys handled themselves, approached their cases and their strengths and weaknesses as attorneys. None of this was shown to the viewer, leading to genuine apathy among the people I knew who watched the show. When I brought it up after a few months, a friend was surprised to hear I was still watching it. I should have followed her advice when she said she gave up on the show after a few months of unanswered questions and lack of character development. 

I've got my fingers crossed that there will be something different @ 10 P.M. to replace this especially since watching the first episode of the 2nd season. Sorry, Shondra, while I love Grey's Anatomy & Scandal, I just can't get interested in your latest creation. I gave it a full season and even decided to try once again but it was torturous for me. Better luck next time.
