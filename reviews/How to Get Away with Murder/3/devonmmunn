Note: I've only seen the first season on seven episodes of the second season and Warning: Will contain mild spoilers OK, so I decided to check this out cause it is fairly popular and I ended up overall disliking, my main issue is the characters, my god, these are the most frustrating characters I've ever seen, now this could be Intentional, but that doesn't negate my opinion, cause all they do is constantly make stupid decisions, lie, cheat on their spouse, f@ck up someone's life or kill somebody, ugh, they go on my nerves so bad, along with overwhelming melodrama, if you love it that's fine, but personally, I really didn't like it
