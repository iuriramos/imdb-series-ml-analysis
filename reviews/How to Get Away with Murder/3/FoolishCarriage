If your idea of an exciting legal drama laced with murder mystery is listening to lines like "My penis needs an orgasm," and watching repetitive flashback scenes of a woman's face as she slowly suffocates while trying to suck air from inside a plastic bag tied around her head, then this show is for you!! Or, if you want to watch extended scenes of sexual activity, both homosexual and heterosexual, this show is still for you! I am supposed to write ten lines to make it a review; but there's not much more to say about this show. I thought it would be interesting and dramatic; instead it is vulgar and tasteless and tells me the writers are too lazy to create good, suspenseful drama and feel a need to fill the show with sex scenes in EVERY episode. These are not germane to the story; I don't need or want shock value filler. I've always been a Viola Davis fan; but I'm surprised to find her apparently OK with this show that would be better suited for the late night erotica. I have begun to record it because I have to FF through the crap; and I find very little left. Likely will quit watching altogether. I feel this is a bait and switch situation. Expecting good mystery and drama -- getting conversations about a girl who's never had an orgasm and a gay man counting down to the moment he can use his lover to get off. They have reduced every gay relationship on the show to nothing but sex.
