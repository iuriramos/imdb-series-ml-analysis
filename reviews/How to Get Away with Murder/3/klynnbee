I wanted to like this show and I can get past the unrealistic nature of the show, but it's the despicable characters that I can't stomach. I've yet to find one redeeming quality of any of them. It leaves my stomach turned and feeling disappointed in human nature. I gave it most of the first season to see if it would redeem itself, but not so far with one episode left. On top of all that, the main character drives me insane with her indignant attitude toward her cheating husband when she was cheating on him too. Clearly Viola Davis is a good actress if she can make me hate her character so much that I want to scream at her to shut her whiny, duplicitous face.
