When I saw the commercials for this show, I actually didn't know who Viola Davis was.(I don't get out much...) However, I do like Shonda Rimes so I was going off that and now I can say that I like Viola Davis as well.

I really like this show so far. My lawyer friends hate it so I'm thinking it must be good. As far as it not being realistic in it's court room portrayal...Have you hung out much in a court room? It's about as entertaining as watching dust accumulate. If it were like real court, it'd be a snooze fest in 10 minutes. Which this show isn't.

The one thing I will say about the premise of the pilot episode-lot of similarity to when Elle Woods first arrived at Harvard Law School. Unprepared 1st day student, shark professor with a law firm that just happens to take 4 students to intern/work...lol, just sayin'.

I actually liked most of the characters and we'll see if they get fleshed out as the season goes on. There were a couple that were a little too formulaic but time will tell.

All in all, I'm definitely going to keep watching to find out!
