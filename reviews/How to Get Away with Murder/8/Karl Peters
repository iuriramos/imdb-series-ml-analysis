...in almost 56 years of life I've never worked or been "friends" with this many lying, deceptive, backstabbing, self-absorbed pricks such as these lot! With chums/colleagues like this who needs enemies...or a law degree? Compelling viewing though and top of the pile for network telly, I'll continue to watch. Entertaining, for sure and good acting (I'm sure glad it's acting!) Viola Davis is awesome, as expected, and the rest of the lesser known cast are no let down. From the get-go the viewer is hard pressed to decipher the motives of all the various characters at play and the reverse time sequences do well in keeping up the suspense, ever-drawing nearer to an undoubtedly nasty conclusion. This would be good as a mini-series, hope it doesn't drag on to infinity and spoil the ideal.
