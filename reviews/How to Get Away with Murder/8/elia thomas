HA! The other reviews make me laugh. The one about Viola's hair just makes me sad. First of all - to the lawyer who rants about how unrealistic this show is, you imply that you think all other shows are realistic. They are not!! Also, implying that anyone who watches this and hasn't gone to law school will think it's real IS arrogant. Secondly, she did not violate confidentiality since the client was clearly aware and OK with involving the students. Now, this show is unrealistic, but fun. The acting is good, and from what I've seen, the plot is laid out well. I am looking forward to seeing more. If you want something that will change your life, maybe take a trip to a third world country or watch an acclaimed documentary. BUT if you are interested in a simple guilty pleasure that has a bit to do with crime, give it a try!
