Viola Davis is just awesome and brilliant. Totally think she rocks it as an actor. The writing is mediocre but worth watching because of Davis. I am hoping the writers upgrade story content and give the characters a little more emotional depth .... 

I am not sure why American television sometimes seems to dummy down plot lines or characters. At this time slot really we can use a little more intellectual stimulation rather than the one or two dimensional characters they offer us. Also the plot lines I don't know seem rather contrived although if you suspend the stupid premises they are built upon, you can sit through it.

I am hoping the writers get it together as I have really enjoyed Davis' acting.
