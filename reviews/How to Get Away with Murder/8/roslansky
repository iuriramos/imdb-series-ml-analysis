This show is so fun to watch. Sure, it is probably not very accurate when it comes to practicing law or going to law school, but it is definitely entertaining!! Lots of OMG moments. The idea that a professor is teaching/using her students to defend some outrageous murder suspects is pretty far fetched, but if you go into it with the expectation that it is purely entertainment you will not be disappointed. So many twists, cliff hangers, deceit, love, lust, pretty people, and some humor as well. I recommend this show for anyone who likes a little psychological drama in their lives. It it characteristic of Shonda Rhimes and her past endeavors. I love the way her mind works!!
