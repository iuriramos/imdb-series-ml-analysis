Just tiny spoilers at most.

Well first of all, yes, this show isn't very realistic but that's pretty much the case for 95% of shows these days and it doesn't make it less good in any way, in fact the lack of realism makes it interesting.

What makes "how to get away with murder" better than most similar shows, is that the characters actually behave human, they are afraid, panic, fall into deprivation when under shock, protect themselves at the cost of others and each character has his own range of moral levels. Each character is likable, built up nicely, does have a past and has a vivid range of emotions and facets.

Another point that makes this show great is the intriguing flash-forward-structure that makes you want to know what'll happen next no matter what as well as the thrilling story arcs and the surprising but convincing plot twists. The show isn't afraid to let its protagonists fail and suffer, distrust each other but forces them at the same time to stick together.

What makes me give it only 8 stars instead of 10? Well the thing that keeps this show from being amazing instead of great for me is simply that Wes gets more attention than Laurel. Yes, I do realize that's not a reason. No, I don't care.
