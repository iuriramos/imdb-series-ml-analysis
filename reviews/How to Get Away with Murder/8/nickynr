Viola Davis who i loved watching from "the help" is doing a great job here too!! Pretty strong character at the same time vulnerable..mysterious..Plus all the other law students adds up to the drama of this serial!! (P.S the gay scenes were unnecessary) I didn't find it hard to follow the past and present they show at times..its easy to realize which is which unlike some reviews i read here. I'm not explaining much here and create spoilers for you all who have not started watching yet. Until now i would say this show is Brilliant!! and Worth watching!!So please keep up this pace and the suspense at each end of the episode!!

8/10
