To start with, The show is good, something parvenu, I wouldn't argue on saying this is the best show ever, however the last episode was appalling.

Again, I can't judge the entire season with just 1 good episode. The show started with 1 murder and the residue of that continued till the end and I'm hoping the same will have it's effect even in the next season(if there is one).

However, I believe the show should not be judged based on the legal parts, this is a show not a LAW school, where you will literally learn everything about LAW.

It's all about drama and how you evade from murder.

Overall, I have enjoyed the show.
