I love the show. It is compelling, suspenseful, exciting, and mysterious-even mouth dropping! The actors are great and casting was done beautifully. They are very convincing. I look forward to watching the show weekly and feel the show can go a long way...but, I can't stand and am disappointed at the gay sex scenes. They sere no purpose and actually takes away from the show's effectiveness. The show doesn't need that input it can and will stand alone without it. The gay sex scenes add nothing to the show but it takes away greatly its integrity, purpose/impact. Lose the gay sex scenes. If not this will be the ultimate end to a great show.
