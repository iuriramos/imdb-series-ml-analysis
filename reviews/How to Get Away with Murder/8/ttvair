I watched the TV show with actress Viola Davis, How To Get Away With Murder. I thought it was done exceptionally well as the other murder mysteries/police shows. However, it had a certain spiciness cause the main character is strong and sexy who knows her stuff. She has secrets and is going to train her students to yes you can get away with murder in many ways. Slippery slope and ethics combined with mortality affects everyone. I hope the director will add more of the issue of reverse discrimination or harassment at work since it is subtle reality of the American workplace. This is not her Viola Davis's main job in the drama, but maybe she can assist another lawyer or her student. This would make some interesting drama.
