After watching the mid-season finale of the show I was left wanting more and am anticipating a great finish.

I thought I'd check out what other people thought of this show and am left shocked by the amount of negativity revolving around it! This show was brilliant, I'd highly recommend watching it (even if it doesn't accurately portray law in general). There was also no shortage of diversity when it came to the cast, all who played their characters very well. The constant flashbacks were exciting, the script was well written, the development of the characters was top notch.

I don't see where they'll go with Season 2 and hope it doesn't become too repetitive or milked.
