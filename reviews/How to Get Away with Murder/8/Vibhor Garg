Spoiler Alert (background story)! having being watched over several serials till date, esp of the genre crime, mystery and thriller genre. this is a must watch.

every episode of the show moves so fast and yet it is gripping. you wont realize where those 45 minutes went. the plot is very interesting and all the main 5 characters have their own background story with respect to the the main plot and are revealed slowly and carefully after in each episode.

viola davis has done an excellent job. loved her acting form the 1st minute. every episode contains different case but the background story gets better n more interesting after every episode. i would advice the viewers to give it a chance till the 3rd episode and you shall see how the plot unfolds.
