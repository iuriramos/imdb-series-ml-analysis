I doubt the writers intention was to depict exactly how things are at law school. The show is based around the title and is good at what it does. The law students characters I agree are a bit boring amongst other things but I feel they are portrayed as any student would be at the beginning of a new term, shy, competitive and new to the game. As the season evolves so will the characters. To all the law students reviewing the show, jeez give it a chance Nobody wants to watch a show titled "How life is at law school" I agree it's not the greatest show out there and I don't think it going for best drama of the year award but nevertheless it's a good show to leave on when all the lights are off and I'm ready to go to bed.
