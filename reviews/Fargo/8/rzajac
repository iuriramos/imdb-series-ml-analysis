When you first start watching, the pastiche is so thick you fear you might not be able to ignore it.

But, in my experience, as it simmered along, I found that the story development swept me up and bore me along. I was able to stave off the sense that they were trying to ride along on the weighty prestige of the original movie--or movies; pretty sure they were tapping "No Country..." as well.

It's pretty much character development, touch-and-go story development, and superb production values.

Speaking of those values, though, the fey approximation of the original soundtrack music had a cloying effect that wouldn't let go, unfortunately.

But it was a great venue for the talent, turned to good theater.

Loved certain of the casting choices, e.g., Key and Peele! Odenkirk! Goldberg! And everyone else does a sterling job.
