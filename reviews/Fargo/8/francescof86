The show is populated by amazing characters, each of them giving precious moments that make it completely worth following each episode. The directors focus on them and their motives behind every action they undertake while keeping the suspense up so to make the audience guess what will happen next. This, coupled with the location, makes for a rewarding experience and one cannot help but thinking why TV is getting better than Movies in terms of talent behind the camera and story-writing. The story is told in such a clever way that there is no element left undeveloped or told in a banal way. The actors are superb and truly commit themselves in order to embody every contradiction, aspiration and responsibility for their action they hold. Patrick Wilson ("Hard Candy", "Little Children", "The Conjuring") is a revelation and, hopefully, his brilliant turn will give him the chance to star in more worthy projects. Kirsten Dunst ("Melancholia", "Midnight Special", "Marie Antoinette", "The Virgin Suicides", "The Cat's Meow") , in the most complex and dark role among the others, is once again able to display every bit of her character. Ted Danson, Jesse Plemons and Jean Smart play equally effectively their key roles. The rest of the cast is also outstanding. My vote is 8/10
