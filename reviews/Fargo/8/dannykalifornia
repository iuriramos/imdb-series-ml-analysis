Ummmm ..WOW. I too have been looking for a replacement for Breaking Bad. I found it. It is not as good as Breaking Bad....It has some plot holes...some predictability...But DANG, it has me wanting more. I don't know if I like the stunt casting...but so far it works. The time jump to a year ahead was an inexpensive plot ploy that BB would never had allowed. If Fargo wants to me in the same league as Breaking Bad....it needs to have a more Long Term perspective.....Time jumps suck and brings down the integrity of the "Whole"

Watch this show from the beginning....(just like.......)

Character development is slow coming at times....But eventually satisfies...

Watch it....but watch more than one episode at a time
