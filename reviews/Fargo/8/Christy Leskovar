Until the end, very well done, David Lean-esque wide screen vistas, a very cinematic sweeping score, also Lean-esque. There is terrific dramatic writing on cable TV these days. What made "Fargo" different was that there were actually nice people in it, which made it all the more intriguing. We had good people to root for as a counter to the menacing, charming villain played by Billy Bob Thornton. Some of it was quite gory; however, what could have been the most gory scene was not gory  very artfully and cleverly done. I liked that the dialogue was not heavily peppered with profanity. All of the acting was tremendous but especially Martin Freeman  the quirky character that he created in Lester. My only fault was with one part of the end that I wish they'd have done differently. I read that the next season will have a whole new cast. This viewer will miss Molly and Gus.
