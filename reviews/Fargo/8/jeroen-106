I had problems watching Fargo the first 30 minutes, being a fan of the original motion picture. It's so weird to see the Fargo theme without

its characters. Luckily, this show draws you in pretty quickly.

I'm personally not a fan of Lester Nygaart's character until now. I guess this is not just Martin Freeman, but mostly writing and direction. 

I thought it was almost unbearable to watch him being bullied by his wife. It just doesn't seem like a couple who could have been married for so long. Why is she so mean, at the same time accepting her marriage? Even divorced couples aren't that hateful. There is no love at all which isn't very plausible. I also didn't like the scene where Lester is desperately trying to sell insurances to a couple. It felt like a bad rip off from the original movie with William H Macy as a frustrated car salesman. At least that character was played with frustration under the surface, whereas Martin Freeman was trying too hard, "playing" to much instead of "being".

Luckily the writers dared to write an original storyline (unlike the dreadful From Dusk Till Dawn series), and the inclusion of Billy Bob Thorton was a great move. That guy cracks me up and is a great "replacement" for the original movie's bad guys.

I'm curious what the next episodes will bring but generally I really likes the first episodes, albeit with a couple of weak scenes and directional mistakes.
