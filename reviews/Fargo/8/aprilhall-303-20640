I was looking for the "quotes" section that I've seen on IMDb, that I've seen before on this site, but perhaps they only exist for Movies on the site.

So, I went ahead and posted a couple of real beauts here. Apologies if I've missed placing these in the correct location.

PS Since these are quotes, they might "spoil" some of the show for you, so don't read ahead if you don't like spoilers.

Two great lines from the new series, Fargo:

"I've taken shits that I want to live with more than them." "grieving widow", former stripper, Mrs Hess says of her two sons, just after seeing one son accidentally shoot another son in the ass with a cross bow, for the 2nd time, apparently.

And contract killer says to young drug dealer when being offered a zombie kit "it's already a dog-eat-dog-world, friend, I'm not sure what worse a bunch of zombies could do."

You be the judge. There are 3 episodes so far.
