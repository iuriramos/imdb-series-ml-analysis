Series I was so well done. Series II was so weak I didn't finish watching it. Not sure what happened. Such great character and story work in Series I. Series II just wasn't believable and horrible to watch. So we abandoned the show. Shame! Wondering whether Series III is worth my time. Hmmmm.... Comments anyone who has a similar opinion... What are your thoughts on III? Thanks I don't see why I need to write 10 lines. What is this policy guys. Check the content. The comments are valid. Thanks I don't see why I need to write 10 lines.
