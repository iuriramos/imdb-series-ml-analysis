season one was great it had such a great feel to it.. much like the movie.. season two on the other hand doesn't feel the same.. its OK, but as of now i could stop watching it and not really care.. the first season I had to watch.. i think some of it is because of the writing and characters, and also the acting.. 

Jeffery Donovan doesn't fit the part at all.. the reason i loved season 1 and the movie is everyone is eerily calm.. Donovans character is too angry and loud.. and to be honest he is pretty much the only one in the entire show who is...and for me it ruins it.. i realize thats a weird reason to dislike a show but it doesn't feel the same with his attitude.
