Fargo's first season is a show with a lot of violence and a lot of tension throughout. The first episode is absolutely terrific. Yet, from there on, while the action and tension still are there, they only happen because certain details are passed over by the show runners for convenience. The cops in the show, while some are complete fools that are there for comedic effect, there are others that know what they are doing, but still do not do what a common sense police officer would do. And it was hard for me to just let those details go as I watched the show.

To give an example of this: I rob a bank with working security cameras. I make a clean getaway in Chicago. The police investigate the crime. They have no idea who robbed the bank and the trail is cold. So, then I rob another bank and the same thing happens. It is exciting for the sake of a television show. But New York City has security cameras throughout the city, where the police could have easily tracked me on where I went, arrested me, and prevented the second robbery. Yet, I choose to never even mention this in the show that the police could do this even though it is common knowledge that they could--all so I could just advance the plot.
