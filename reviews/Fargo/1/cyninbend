I quit watching half an hour into this sexist, insulting piece of garbage. The movie is one of my favorites of all time. Yet I soon discovered that the best character in it--and the only female not a stripper or a hooker, or a housewife with no lines beyond nods or screeches--had been changed into a man. A perfect flawless man with a none-too-bright pregnant wife at home and a dingbat moron employee sidekick. Take out a brilliant woman and add 2 more stereotypes...did the Coen brother married to the star of the movie version get divorced and try to divorce the movie character as well? That was the inescapable feeling I got, and enough to make me shut off after the 2d moronic group of comments by the now-demoted female cop and the corrections to her flawed reasoning by her new boss, the now-male police chief. I wish the Coen Brothers were sentenced to read the book Backlash cover to cover for ruining a great movie's memory. I still have the DVD if I ever forgive them tho I'll never watch this tripe of a TV show. It's a shame people are still so unenlightened they buy into such stereotypes, judging by all the good reviews.
