I watched this show (I bought it on DVD) because I absolutely love the original Fargo movie. I rate the movie 10/10, and there are very, very few things that deserve that high a rating. I own the movie, and have watched it many times, and have had the pleasure of introducing others to it. Unfortunately those making this series appear to have totally missed what made the original movie great (at least for me). They have imitated the style of the movie, but have totally and utterly failed to capture any of its heart. The original movie certainly has merits on many levels. The cinematography and music are great, for example, and some of that is imitated reasonable competently in this series. However, after many viewings, I feel that the real heart of the movie lies in its characters. Almost every character in the movie is a delight to watch, even the bad guys, stupid and misguided though they may be. The TV series simply does not have that at all. Most of the characters are just annoying and unpleasant to watch. Deputy Molly comes closest to capturing the strength of the original movie. But she is not enough on her own. Her Dad is pretty good too. And Martin Freeman does a good job as Nygaard. Also Colin Hanks as Gus. But I wouldn't fault any of the actors. The writing and direction is just completely missing what made the original film a jewel to watch and re-watch. To give this one star compared to the film's ten is to over-rate it - it's not close to a tenth as good as the movie. Somewhere around a half a star would be closer to the truth. If you love the movie Fargo, I wouldn't recommend this series to you at all.
