The series premiere is one of the worst things I've seen in a long time. It is unbelievably bad in many different ways. To think that the Coens were involved with this blows my mind. Freeman's accent is terrible, and literally unintelligible at times. The shot selection at its worst is cliché, and some of the edits help land the clichés. The characters and dialogue and scene construction are god-awful and ham-fisted. There's a nagging wife, a dweeb salesman, a local bully, and so on. Everything about this is like an elephant playing piano. It's "quirky"(tm) without being at all charming or even original in the way that a series based on the movie could have been. Good grief. Willa Paskin's review on Slate gets at some of the problems of the series.
