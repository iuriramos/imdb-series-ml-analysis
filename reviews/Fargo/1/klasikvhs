HORRIBLE! Fargo is in my top 5 films of all time and this looks like some bootleg ripoff. They claim it's new characters & story lines but its a lie. The characters are cheap 2 dimensional facsimiles of the amazing performances from the film. The plot points are thoughtless and the performances, shallow. Scenes stolen right from the film. Snow covered highways. quirky north dakota types that seem like actors trying their best to be unusual. All in all it is a horrible, HORRIBLE idea for a TV show ripoff of an absolutely incredible classic film. Billy Bob Thornton is the only actor portrayal that is worthy of an award nomination.
