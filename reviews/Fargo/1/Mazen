A friend of mine was always going on about this series and insisted it was brilliant. I have always been reluctant to watch season programmes but after watching BREAKING BAD which was superb, I thought I'd give in and watch the first season of Fargo. Well, I was extremely disappointed with the series and the acting was very basic. Billy Bob and Michael Freeman were somewhat acceptable but the rest of the cast was really awful. Gus Grimley was a wimp and reminded me of a comic strip character who actually was a wimp, Solverson was supposed to be a detective, the best one mind, but still played the part of a simpleton cop 'very successfully!!!' and I could moan load's about the other actors... I couldn't believe the script and choice of actors for the police in particular. They were made out to look inept and stupid and, dare I say, simpletons! The way they spoke with "Oh Jeez" and "Yep" and "Oh boy" and so on was so basic and although the storyline was interesting, it was hard to believe that it could have been true when you consider the level of acting. If the series was meant to emphasise the stupidity of a police force in the US, it succeeded - in every way. And to play the devil's advocate, I did watch the COMPLETE season 1 and although the plot was interesting, the bad acting from season 1 will prevent me from watching any of the others.
