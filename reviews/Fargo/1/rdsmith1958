Derogatory characterization of Midwestern whites, pointlessly violent, moronic dialog...a horrible take off on the original film...the Coen brothers showed the culture with humor and good natured parody...this show was crude, insulting, and exaggerated to the point of being idiotic...the scenes were unrealistic in terms of behavior to the point where I swore they were actually making a parody of the movie...then I realized they were merely trying to be imitative...the fact it averaged 9 stars is truly sad but not surprising ...I have to say I only watched one episode but I could not stand another one...I'm sure if blacks or Jews had been parodied and made to look this idiotic and depraved, the ADL and NAACP would have been all over the producers in a NY minute...
