Terrible, just bad. 
I just came from Fargo, and although I liked the movie from the Cohen  brothers. I found the people and the town are nothing the way the show  nor the movie portrays.  
Most of the actors and actresses have poor Dakota accents on this show  and there is little of the actual city portrayed, with nothing but ice  and snow portrayed.  
The homes are on the show are nothing but California homes with some  plastic flake on them, and look nothing like the neighborhoods in the  REAL Fargo. 
I do not believe the show has actually been shot in N. Dakota. Most of  the trucks in the show are not even 4x4's and that is all people have  up there if they own a truck. 
In all, a poor job of actually portraying life in Fargo.  
Really poor. Really Really poor. FYI Poor
