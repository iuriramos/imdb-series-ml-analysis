Rule no 1 of fight club XXXXXXXX sorry IMDb reviews:.

If it's a 9 rated movie then it's been hyped.

With a current overall of 9.0 and an S02E01 rating of 9.2 then this is a prime example.

Setting a series in the past does not mean that the standard of acting should be set back into the cheesy quality of a 50s B movie (that said I love B movies) and re-hashing successful old plots should not be done for the sake of it.

Not clever or ironic, this is a lame and contrived performance of tired subject.

I thought Ted Danson did an excellent job of re-inventing himself in the CSI expansion but he has undone much of that credit in this performance.

Frances McDormand killed the character of Sheriff Marge Gunderson in the 1996 original and no follow-up is necessary other then to line the pockets of greedy producers. Anyone wanting and ongoing taste of excellence should just re-run the original movie once every week or two and you will have a far better feeling then watching these re-hashed series.

Current rating of the Oscar winning 1996 original is 8.2 which is about right. This falls well short of that mark.
