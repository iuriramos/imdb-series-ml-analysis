What people find entertaining shows how low humanity has fallen. Stupid people killing stupid people through the decoration of dead animal meat flesh to tantalize your blood thirst. 

Its not clever, it is just ugly.. . it is all just ugly vile and a waste of time.

If you like this show, maybe take a look at yourself and wonder what the hell is wrong with you. Do you find it uplifting to know there are people more inept as you? Do you like to see stupid people get away with murder?...or is it the quirky satire that leaves you feeling satisfied that 'ain't life strange' with the notion you have escaped your real sad life for an hour. Wow....how pathetic is that.
