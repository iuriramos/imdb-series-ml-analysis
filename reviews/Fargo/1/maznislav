I mean come on. This is some kind of believable story or something ? It starts great and the first couple of episodes is setting you up for something amazing. And then what happens ? Of course you have this demi god guy that is like a superman walking on earth knows everything even before it happens. Every police officer is pictured as a not very intellectual individual and their only purpose is to shoot everything that walks or let the suspect go. In my opinion this is a very bad production aiming very high and landing almost on point zero. No point of watching this unless you have an IQ lower than 70 and your only entertainment is to see some gun fire. And even in this case you can just watch some documentary on guns. I can only compare this with the pure mediocrity of second season of True Detective or the mindless nonsense that happens to be the new Tarantino movie.
