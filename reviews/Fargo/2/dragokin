In the era of remakes it was Fargo's turn to become a TV show. Aiming at audience that appreciates their work and that was presumably too young to witness the movie in the ninety nineties, the Coen brothers embarked on another ego trip. This time they were executive producers, but even so their signature is all over the show.

The writing is in line with everything the Coen bothers have done. A bunch of wannabe weirdos, deadbeats and idiots are in a story that won't lead us anywhere. Most of them are in their thoughts, barely communicating with each other. The amazing thing is that eventually a lot of people might consider this as the ultimate entertainment.

I'm not sure whether i've seen too many movies and TV shows or i'm simply too old to be the target audience, yet i wasn't able to connect with Fargo. It could be that i take movie watching too seriously and cherish the time i invest into it, but Fargo was wasting my time. And it remained unclear whether this should be a black comedy, a crime drama or both.
