The acting is very nice but the script is shallow, over the top and pointless when you look at it from beginning to the end as a whole.

The so-called "true story" gimmick rescues it by keeping it attached to a possible reality.

Actually in some way that is synonymous to cheating.

Massive plot holes and side stories leading nowhere shows it was made for just TV for a predesignated duration.

After all unreasonable escalation of the tension and curiosity, plot concludes with a disappointing ending.

Another overrated series at least....
