I made the mistake of buying the series on Blu-ray. Jeez! It apes pretty much every Coen Bros movie, from Blood Simple to No Country for Old Men- and steals numerous beats from Fargo the movie- which I love dearly. I would have bought into echoed beats from the movie, mind you, but many of them are merely lifted- with no organic purpose to the story at hand. Then there's the bad guy- Billy Bob Thornton. Loved Billy Bob in numerous roles- particularly The Man Who Wasn't There. Love that movie! But here...jeez again! No! And I was down for an amazing series- hence jumping the gun and buyin' the damn thing. It's impossible to connect to this story - episode after episode; the bad guy appears to be a step ahead of everyone, and shows no concern for any flippin' thing. Why's he doing stuff anyway? I still don't know, nor do I care. 

Most annoying character- Martin Freeman as Lester Nygaard. Most appealing character, Bob Odenkirk. Characters that I feel utter indifference toward- everyone else. 

Anyhoo- yea, I hated it. Long live Fargo the movie.
