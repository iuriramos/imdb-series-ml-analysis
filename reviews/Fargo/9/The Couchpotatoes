We can thank the Coen brothers again for this brilliant show. I enjoyed every single second of the first two seasons. Both great stories, told and acted brilliantly. All the actors that participated in the two seasons did a great job. Being European myself and only knowing the proper English language I had a lot of fun hearing the accent from Minnesota. Unlike the southern accent that I really don't like, the Minnesotean accent is a delight to listen to. The way the story is been told and filmed makes this show stand above a lot of similar shows. It looks almost perfect to me, can't really say anything bad about this series. I am already looking forward to a third season in the hope we get another great crime story like the first two. They were quite unbelievable with a lot of actions and twists but certainly a great entertainment to watch.
