Well, To be Honest, after reading some of the reviews and ratings, I gave this series a try. Although at first I had a comparison of this show to "Breaking Bad" comparing as "Walter White's" Character is somewhat likewise to that of "Lester Nygard" but then after couple of episodes when it got intense, I was like NO WAY these two can be compared as they belonged to entirely different leagues. 

Now, What is amazing about this show is that all the movies like "Rush", "Captain Philips", "We are Marshall's" etc., have a TRUE STORY Inspiration which is moulded into excellent watch by some of the finest Talents in the movie industry. "FARGO" is the best of them in Television yet (True Stories Explained).

Billy Bob Thornton is the best as Lorne Malvo. Excellent with his baleful influence with a cunning smile everywhere. 

And Martin Freeman is simply astonishing with the character of "Lester Nygaard" Oh he so lives up in the character that for a moment I had a doubt that 'is this the same fella as Dr. Watson from Sherlock ?' and to my amusement he is although he must have really worked hard to get that accent perfected.

All the cast were put as they should have and the performance of each and everyone of them was astounding, even the 'Hess' Kids.

The Story is so gripping that I watched it Non-Stop for Ten Straight Hours Jumping the Lunch as well on a Saturday morning. 

I Recommend it for all and I Hope it continues to Amaze me with another series (I Hope The Coen Brother can come up with something)
