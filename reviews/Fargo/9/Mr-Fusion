that FARGO was successful in retaining the feel and atmosphere of the original Coen Bros.' movie (and stand on its own unique tone) or that it was so damn good in the process? As a long-form TV series, no less. Billy Bob Thornton's never been so captivating; he balances charm and menacing like you wouldn't believe. Martin Freeman meanwhile takes dweeby Lester Nygaard to Walter White levels of despicableness - and plays it like it was a snap. There are terrific performances across the board (an honorable mention for Allison Tolman), but these two were amazing. 

FARGO is one hell of a series; consistently engrossing and and only gets better as it wears on. It didn't take long for this show to have me cursing the screen when the weekly cliffhanger arrived, and that one-year-later time jump was a daring move and it was anyone's guess where this story was going. This show made for top-notch television, and I can't wait to see where they go in season 2. 

Please let this get renewed.
