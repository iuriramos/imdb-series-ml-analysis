Once i was surfing in IMDb for best crime come action series like DEXTER and other series. Suddenly FARGO caught my eye. First of all, the poster is something different, it got all my attention. And i went through the story line and the other reviews and i was little puzzled whether to download this series or not because am not much into DRAMA kind of thing. But believe me when i say "this is a must watch series", this series has got MARTIN FREEMAN and BILLY BOB THORNTON, both of them are best actors and i went for it, i downloaded and i watched till the latest episode. This is one of the best series, because you will never know what's going to happen next and who will die. The episodes are constructed in such a way that the viewers must watch the next coming episodes. FREEMAN and BILLY BOB's portrayal of Lester and Malvo is exquisite. 

I say go for it guys.I think the 2nd or 3rd episode is little slow, but don't stop watching, because you might regret later.
