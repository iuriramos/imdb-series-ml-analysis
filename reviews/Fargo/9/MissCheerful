One of the most outstanding series of the year, with a fantastic & all lovable cast, exciting plot, and brilliant story telling. I don't remember enough about the movie, only that Frances McDormand was great. This was quite different, especially when the story developed differently (I think) and was drawn out into a full series.

What made the show so outstanding has got to be the performances by the whole entire cast. Everyone, from the perfectly cast detectives, to the Oh so cool Billy Bob Thornton, Ted Danson the sweet dad, to my beloved and brilliant Watson, I mean Martin Freeman. It was just a dark comedy throughout. The show was hilarious, yet chilling at the same time - to witness a regular Mr. nice guy spiral into evilness. I love stories with endings where everyone gets what they deserve. So satisfying!
