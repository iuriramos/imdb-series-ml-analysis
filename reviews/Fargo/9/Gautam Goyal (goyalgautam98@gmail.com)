From the very first episode, the show keeps you glued to your television sets. 

The transformation of Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman) from being an innocent loser to a coldblooded criminal has been portrayed exceptionally. Billy Bob Thornton plays a dark, merciless hit-man, Lorne Malvo. 

The series brilliantly describes the train of events which follow their first meeting at a hospital.

Not having seen the "Fargo", the 1996 movie , I didn't face any difficulty understanding the characters, their past, or the storyline in general. It is a standalone series and watching the movie is NOT a prerequisite. 

With the correct amount of humour, great characterisation, and outstanding performances by all the leads, the series can be counted amongst the best in its genre. 

However, this series would not be appreciated by all. With a tremendous amount of blood and violence, the series is ideal for dark comedy lovers, or lovers of the crime genre in general. 

It would be unfair to judge the show entirely on the basis of its first season, as the coming season appears to be narrating a different incident altogether.
