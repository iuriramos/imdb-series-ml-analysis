/refers to Seasons 1 and 2/

As the Fargo movie is one of the finest pieces I've ever seen, I was somehow hesitant to plunge into the Fargo series - in spite of noted cast and accolades. Apparently, I feared that an extended story with different and/or inserted characters could create confusions and unnecessary intertwines.

But from the 1st episode, I was "caught" by the story-line, the approach and distinct characters and performances (particularly Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman whom I have always admired and followed in so diversified roles). As the depiction of "bad guys" excelled the "good" ones, I found myself in feeling often for Malvo and Nygaard, regardless of their felonies, wishing more scenes with their presence. True, when they faced their fate, I was not frustrated, and I never identified myself with them, as they were no good persons committing accidental crimes. 

Season 2, however, had more interesting/versatile performances among the supporting cast - Jeffrey Donovan, Bokeem Woodbine, Nick Offerman, Jean Smart, above all, and there were less scenes I could giggle or express wow!/wtf!... But it is still a solid narration, with a number of actors in uncommon performances. References to and connections with Season 1 events provided additional value, but unlike Season 1, the solutions here based more on teamwork (local mob vs. distant mob vs. police). But the 1970ies era was well captured, and "irregularities" in the plot (Hanzee's motives) were quaintly included and clarified.

Thus, 9 points for 1st season and 8.5 for 2nd one. Well done, and I am looking forward to Season 3.
