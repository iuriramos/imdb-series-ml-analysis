I went into this series expecting a shoddy movie tie-in. Boy, I was wrong. Right from the first twenty minutes, the series had me hooked. It was dark, but not morbid. Set in the small tight-knit community of Bemidji, the cold rural city provides the perfect backdrop to the masterfully dark plot. Martin Freeman impresses me again, I found him to be decent in Sherlock, and it surprised me to see him put on such an authentic Minnesotan accent. 

But the real stand-out acting performances are form Billy Bob Thorton and Alison Tholman. Thorton's character makes the show. His violent, psychopathic character causes trouble wherever he goes, and he finds a great target in Lester Nygaard whose life is utterly destroyed by one sentence. Yes Or No?
