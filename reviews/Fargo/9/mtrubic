Great pilot.

Very true to the spirit and tone of the movie - love those accents and adorably eccentric characters up there in Fargo.

Billy Bob is one of those creepy villains whose silences and simple turn of phrases speak volumes. 

Great twists and turns - very unpredictable. Knew there had to be a reason why so many accomplished actors are a part of this production.

Writing is excellent. 

Character introductions are particularly well done in Fargo - masterfully so. Adam Bernstein's experience really shows in this production. 

Exemplary - keep it up.
