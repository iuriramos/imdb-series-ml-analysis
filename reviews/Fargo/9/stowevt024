I watched the show last night and I was begging for more. The killing and murders at times seem over the top. However, that being said, I loved it. It is much like the movie "Fargo" and then again it is not. People are getting killed from the get-go. I know it is only the first episode but based on that I would rank it up there with "Breaking Bad" as one of my favorite shows. I hope the Drama and tension keep building. Billy Bob Thornton is a sociopath and Martin Freeman (from the Hobbitt) is fantastic as the hapless character whom much of the first episode orbits around. Great TV. A big thank you to FX. I cannot wait for the next episode.
