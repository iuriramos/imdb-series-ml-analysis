Unmotivated character actions, ludicrous scenarios, a protagonist as unlikeable as the antagonist, and that incessant claim that it's all a "true story." These things detracted from my enjoyment of Fargo: Season One...yet I could not look away. Maybe it was those little moments in the show that kept me sustained, the lines writer/creator Noah Hawley gives Lorne Malvo, delivered with delicious malice by Billy Bob Thornton in what may be his best turn since Sling Blade. These moments of transcendence, these hints at something more than man, something sublimely and timelessly evil. Maybe it was the captivating performance of Allison Tolman, understated, riveting, sweet without being saccharine, driven and imperturbable, like a good cop/deputy should be. Maybe it was Martin Freeman's ostensibly gormless but ultimately wormy, sinister Lester Nygaard. 

And so while the wild, unbelievable scenarios kept on, and the body count stacked up, I kept watching. I kept watching through the episode with the epic "blizzard" - really one of the poorer uses of CGI I've ever seen on screen. Kept watching through the silliness - like the FBI agents Laurel and Hardy routine. Kept watching when, in the penultimate episode, something happens which seems to make absolutely no sense. I won't spoil it, but it really threw me off. 

And then I came to understand something. It had been percolating throughout the series, but the final epiphany came with the sublime final episode: This show is about something. I won't say what, because you should discover it for yourself. I will say this: Lester Nygaard, he's not the protagonist. Both he and Malvo are the antagonists. They're equally rotten. It's Deputy Solverson that's the hero - patient, methodical, temperate, brave, loving. You'll come to root for her - and her fella Gus Grimley. Oh yah, sure, you'll come to see it, as I did, that this show is a little bit of magic. 

You betcha.
