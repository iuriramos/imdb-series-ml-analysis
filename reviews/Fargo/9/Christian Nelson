Fargo is a new Fx series which plays as somewhat of and add on to the 1996 movie of the same name. The show succeeds in capturing the humor, violence and overall finesse of the movie in sublime fashion. The show hosts and extravagant cast of actors including Martin Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton and plenty more. All the characters have interesting personalities and it really mirrors the overarching theme of the show of standing up for your self and how you must eventually pay for your actions. The show is violent and dark however it also boasts in its mundane humor exploited ever so well by the actors. I would recommend Fargo to those who enjoy Breaking Bad and any other good dramas, trust me it is well worth your time.
