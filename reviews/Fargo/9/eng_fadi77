Within the dark and cold theme of this show lies different layers of perceptions of human affairs, human fragility and the potential of human evil. All mixed together to give us an elegant and well built work of art. Plus and contrary to many shows of the genre, most of the events are completely unpredictable. The actors did a great job in portraying the common psychological human traits without making it look dull or uninteresting. I would also say that it has many elements that had been shown in other great shows, and with a good outcome fortunately. The metamorphosis of character and black humor as in 'Breaking Bad', the conflict within police and the character's philosophical sense (though not very obvious) as in 'True Detective' the atmosphere of a tiny and kind of abandoned city which adds more and more to the element of mystery, just like in 'Twin Peaks', and finally the absurdity and morally weird acts and reacts of certain characters, just like in Quentin Tarantino's movies!

P.S: This is my first review and English isn't my first language so this might not be very well expressed or arranged, but I hope you will get something out of it!
