Things Tend to Move at a Reduced Speed in Very Hot and Very Cold Climates. The Weather is Influential and has a Dynamic Effect on the People. This Excellent Adaptation TV Series From the FX Cable Channel Certainly Knows That and the Show Tends to Appear in Slow Motion, or At Least Reduced Speed.

The Speech Patterns and the Way the Thing is Paced is Deliberate and Demands a Bit of Patience from the Viewer, Especially in Today's Hyper-Stylized, Quickly Edited Media. The Coen Brothers Work is Mostly Put Together in This Slowed Down Method. 

The Thing Is, it is a Style and Tempo that Demands Good Writing, No Excellent Writing, Because if the Viewer is Asked to Accept a Paused or Restrained Pace then the Dialog and Characters Have to be in Full Control to Capture the Full Attention of a Restless Audience.

This Does Just That and the Banter and Behavior of the Quirky and Lovable, the Evil and Stupid are Commanding Personas...They are All a Heartbeat from Reality that is Pulp Fiction at its Best.

The Acting is Great All Around with Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thornton as the Centerpiece but the Peripheral Performers Contribute Immensely When Either of These Two are Off Screen. Allison Tolman as the Focused, No-Nonsense, Every-Woman with Skills, Character, and a Baby On Board in the Second Half, is the Identifier, the Reasonable One, in a World Gone Mad. 

She is the There for Some Sanity and Holds Things Together for the Audience as the Bizarre in the Blizzards Just Keeps Getting Weirder and Weirder. The Cast Along with the Writing, Music, and Visuals are All Top-Tier-TV and FX has Another Winner. The Cable Channel has Made Some of the More Offbeat and Edgy Shows in Recent Years.
