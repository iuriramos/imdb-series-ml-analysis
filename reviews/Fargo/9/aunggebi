It is definitely one of the best TV series in 2014. As soon as you watch episode 1, you can feel that this show is totally different from other shows. In show, everyone looks like bit dumb, but that is the key point of the drama. Because of that, without some graphic murder scene and special agent who follows the criminal in amazing way like special memory or psychic skills, it makes its own chill mood.

Local deputy, Molly is not special. Actually she is below than normal in some aspects. But she follows the trail to the criminal in her own way, slow and steady.

Lots of people give claps to tBilly who acted murderer in show, but I really want to give an award to Allison(Molly). She was more than great. In some scenes she shows irreplaceable actings.

As one of the most favorite shows, I can recommend it to almost all American TV series fans all over the world, specially someone who look forward to something new and special.
