At start it looks simple , a typical murder mystery, that kind of thing. but as it progresses it takes you to deepest and darkest form of the human nature. As it said that its based on the true events happened in Minnesota back in 2006, it definitely gives you feel of reality devoid of any dramatization of the actual events.

The story is very unexpected and surprising at some moments.I did not see Coen brothers "Fargo", hence I can not compare between these two. But I am very positive that new one will give good fight to the classic one.

The casting is so superb that performance given by the cast looks very natural. The overall feel of the series is different as its set in winter and in snowy town of Minnesota and sometimes in North Dakota.The background score suits to tragic and sometimes comic nature of the situation.

Currently I'm on the 8th Episode of the season and eagerly waiting on what gonna happen next. If you're still searching for good TV show after breaking bad , you can surely give a try for this one.
