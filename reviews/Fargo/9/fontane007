Just watched the final episode and I have to say this has been a fantastic series. Billy bob Thornton as a clever but psychopathic mob hit-man was brilliant throughout playing the character to the fullest. Then there was Lester played by Martin Freeman of The Office and more recently Bilbo in The Hobbit, it took a little while to get used to Freeman's accent in the series, but his acting won me over and he was great as the bumbling hen pecked husband, who slowly changed as the series goes along. The show ran at a great pace and I thoroughly enjoyed every episode. I was a huge fan of the original film back in the 90's and this series, which is a totally different story to the film, still has the same atmosphere and feel as the film and is all the better for it.
