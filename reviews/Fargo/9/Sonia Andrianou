After Dexter finished, I was in denial to see any other series. Not even the trailers.

Fargo...WOW...Billy Bob Thornton...WOW...mind-blowing. I have no words to describe, how excellent is the story, the actors, each episode which doesn't leave you with a big question-mark on your forehead as a sucker (as so many other series do, because they think that this will make bigger numbers and more success - thumbs down-), but it leaves you filled and comfortable to expect with more open eyes/heart/mind the next episode! Genius!

Seems October 2015, wayyy too long, for the next season to begin. Which will be a new story, with total other characters and so on. GENIUS. I loved the idea and only. A MUST watch.

And why did I vote 9/10? Nothing is perfect, right?
