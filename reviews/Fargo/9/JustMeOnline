I decided to watch it, because i liked the movie very much, and this TV Series was in the same level of quality, with the same environment, with more cold crimes and a good investigation...

The two top actors were great in this, and i'm not a fan or anything of both (B. B. Thornton and Colin Hanks).

I recommend it to everyone who liked the movie and wants to see more crimes in that cold place... and of course to see what happened to the money buried in the snow.

Don't know if there's gonna be a season two... seems like it.
