Great cast. Newcomer Allison Tolman is surprisingly good. Superstar Martin Freeman has sold me to the idea that he is now a guy from Minnesota and not a Brit. And I love watching Keith Carradine in anything he is in. But, let's face it. Billy Bob Thornton steals the show here. With his stoical persona, he is to me a twins-representation of cerebral Mr. Spock (with haircut accordingly) meeting the almost indestructible Luc Besson's hit-man Leon.

Best show on TV since Breaking Bad. A bit over-stylish at times since camera work and soundtrack are sometimes in the way of the narrative flow, but hey, we cannot complain about pushing the TV media to its limit which this show does superbly. A must see.
