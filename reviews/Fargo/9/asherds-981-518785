I decided to give this a watch as I enjoyed the movie so much and love Billy Bob Thornton. I was not disappointed. It starts slowly with mild humor but soon the darkest humor starts to build. There have been only two episodes so far but the story lines are so well written and the comedy is so dry and razor sharp, one can't help but laugh. I hope that Colin Hanks will have a continuing role as this seems to be the perfect vehicle for him. This is some of FX's best. I'm finding that more intelligent TV is possible and this proves it. Billy Bob Thornton, in one scene, is showing his contempt for a thug who is threatening him in one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen on network TV. Although there is a lot of violence, somehow they make it all so funny! This is a show that is bound to get better and better with character development. I would love to see Billy Bob stay with the show but somehow I doubt he will. I can't imagine he would be satisfied with a weekly television series. I would watch it just to see his humorous character each week but the other performers will not disappoint. Lets have more shows like this please.
