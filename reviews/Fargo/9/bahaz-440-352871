Since it's only the Pilot, I can't write a complete review of the entire 6 episode series but I can say my wife and I won't miss one and will undoubtedly lobby for more episodes. With good to excellent regional dialects, the dreariness of the area in winter and blank stares of the otherwise reasonably intelligent people, it has captured the essence of the movie Fargo, absent, of course the irreplaceable Francis McDormand, who wears the curse of such a huge success by an otherwise rather plain journeyman actor who may never again reach that pinnacle, even as the husband of one of the irrepressible Cohen brothers. Too violent, too much strong language so well done they are basically ignorable in the context. Excellent production values with music which enhances the mood without drowning out the dialogue.
