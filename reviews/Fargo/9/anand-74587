Fargo is a great show. The best part is the simplicity with which the story progresses. The story is really smooth, yet not easy to anticipate. Since it is about real events, it is easier to relate with the scenes. The show doesn't fail to capture the audience.Talking about acting, The two main characters played by Martin Freeman and Billy Bob amalgamate perfectly. Freeman has done better job than he did in "sherlock". I give him five stars out of five, for his role transformation in this series. The third main character of a female officer is quite depressing as she tends to brings down the tempo. I didn't like her..somebody else could have done it better. Then comes the sound track,its appropriate and doesn't kill the mood. All in all.. It doesn't stand out like House of cards or Breaking Bad..that we love discussing with others but Fargo is a very good T.V series that would not disappoint its viewers. It was nice to watch a show with not an outlandish theme.
