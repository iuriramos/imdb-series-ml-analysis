Fargo(Season 1).

I really liked the Coen Brothers classic movie of the same name so watching this series was a no brainer for me. The series is of anthology type, meaning each season will have its own set of characters and story etc and will conclude with it.

The show follows a chain of events triggered by a drifter arriving in a small quite town in Minnesota and how law enforcement tries to uncover it. The pacing somewhat reminded me of breaking bad, how slowly everything comes into place and when it does, its exhilarating. The series also has this unique tone covered with a thin layer of dark humor. And it is amazing how horrific events are blended with humor etc in this show.

Acting was amazing all round. Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thornton who play the main characters Lester and Lorne, especially, completely stole the show. There were countless moments where I was just mesmerized by the dialogue and its delivery, especially by Lorne's character. The sinister and evil badass aura of Lorne was masterfully portrayed by Billy Bob, I gained new respect for this man after this show. Martin freeman (Sherlock, The Hobbit) continues to deliver great acting, this possibly being his finest.

The show also had a lot of other characters, mostly great. The niceness of some main characters really contrasted the evilness of others. The unusualness of the show was that the 'Bad Guys' were WAY WAY more interesting than ones who you were suppose to be rooting for. Really made situations tricky for the viewer. :p

The show was beautifully shot, perfectly delivering the cold atmosphere where it was set in. And MAN the soundtrack was awesome, especially the opening one, a great piece.

A great series that I highly recommend everyone to watch.

9.3/10
