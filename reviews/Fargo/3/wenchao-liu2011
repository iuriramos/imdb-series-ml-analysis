The opening statement is a lie. Most of the events in the show are fictional and have no factual basis whatsoever.

It's a shame that a media production claiming everything "has been told exactly as it occurred" contains so few elements of truth.

The 1996 movie with the same name started with the same lie and became a success. However in today's internet era it has been much easier for people to find the truth. The producer need to be reminded of that FACT. 

Overall this show is of quite good quality and more enjoyable than most other shows. I would have given it a 8 out of 10 had not been for the deceptive beginning message.
