I've been looking for a TV series to binge on (since I've finished everything else, having withdrawals!) Saw all the excellent reviews about Fargo, thought I'd give it a shot. Feeling very disappointed... I'm on Episode 5 season 1, and finding it hard to push myself to finish the first season. Overall, I find it on the boring side, the stories are NOT funny to me (and I wonder if it's just funny to people from the Midwest? who get Midwestern humor? I don't know) But I'm finding the stories and humor and characters annoying. Officer Molly, supposedly one of the likable characters, is one of the most annoying to me. With no one to like or root for, this show is overall just extremely annoying, and I do not understand why people like it so much? (unless you identify with the Minnesota culture & humor and characters). I will keep watching but right now, I am not enjoying it! I'll give it a few more episodes.....
