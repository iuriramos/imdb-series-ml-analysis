Funny when it had to be funny, violent when required, emotional when needed. This was perhaps the best series of 2014 alongside True Detective. There have always been doubts about a TV to Movie or movie to TV spin off but this one was genius. Not only the story was good, but the direction was quite amazing too. Plus a cast that everyone dreams of. If someone was missing Breaking Bad like crazy(just like me) I think this is the show that can fill that gap left by Breaking Bad. The connection showed to the movie was quite brilliantly presented too. You might not notice it, but it'll be there. The whole cast was brilliant but Martin Freeman stole the show for me. At one moment he'll be a dangerous and mean guy and at another he'll be a miserable timid middle aged man. His transformation was excellent. Summarizing it, there couldn't be any better dark humor show than this. it's a must watch.
