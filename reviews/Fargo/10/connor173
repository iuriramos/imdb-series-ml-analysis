This takes the Movie a step further.. I rated the movie 9... this is the first 10 I've awarded since West Wing... and to be honest.. it is better than West Wing. The writing and acting are superb.. please can we have more.. and if not why not make a series about the "Billy Bob Thornton" character I was doubtful about the casting of my fellow countryman Martin Freeman in the role but he has made it his own... brilliant timing and delivery. I love the way they manage to weave comedy into the drama.. the Bullies (Hess) two son's fighting in the background was a touch that even Charlie Chaplin would have admired. The strength in depth of each character makes you never want to miss a second. It is a long time since I really looked forward to the next episode of a series. MORE please..
