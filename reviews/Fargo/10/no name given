I don't know art but I know what I like and it's usually art. This show is incredible, particularly the cinematography and direction. Amazingly they stay true to the original movie but create something more unique and beautiful. The production design is extraordinary too. Set in a time when I was growing up, I can't find any fault with the production design, the scenes or the characters. I'm not smart enough to explain some of the quirky parts of the show so I wish they come out with a DVD/bluray with commentary to fill in the parts. In particular, the elevator scene is amazing. I'd pay good money to find out how they did that. 

On the other hand I kind of wish they wouldn't make shows this good. It's like you have your favorite restaurant and you always look forward to going and then you have one bad experience and it throws you in a panic because you don't know if you should kick her to the curb or try again, or is it because you changed or he changed, or whatever and the suddenly your diagnosed bipolar. Maybe it's better to stick with reruns of matlock.
