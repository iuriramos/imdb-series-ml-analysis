Right off the bat, I have to say that this show is highly comparative to True Detective. When True Detective ended, this show popped up. And which do I prefer? Well, while True Detective is of a higher quality, this show is more enjoyable. Another thing it is compared to (more obviously) is the film it is inspired upon. Lester's like Jerry and Molly's like Marge, and the film and the show cross paths at a few points, like they both have a parking lot scene, and the buried money pops up. But by far, the stand-out of the first season is Lorne Malvo, because he can get under your skin at parts and give you a chuckle at other parts. I will update this review by season, and as a side-note, the limited edition beanie is great, and I bought it since it's getting cold up here in Minnesota. If you enjoyed the film, you'll like this.
