Season 2 review:

Coming off of no doubt a flawless season 1 filled with amazing characters created by Noah Hawley and one of the best villain played by Billy bob Thornton, how can you possibly top season ones season?? I mean it was perfect!!!! Easy. Noah Hawley decided to have season 2 set in 1979 as a prequel. Where true detective failed in its sophomore season, Fargo succeeded. Better characters are introduced to us this season and just when I thought there couldn't be a better villain than in season one...the curtains lift to introduce us to mike Mulligan who is absolutely brilliant and just as good with top notch dialogue and humor. There are many easter eggs in this season to connect to the first season and a wink at the film just as the first season. This season is superior to the first and has now been renewed for a third I can't wait to see the direction and characters. Each episode is filled with laugh out loud moments followed by drama with an unbelievable soundtrack. If ever you were to label a season a masterpiece the second season is such. It's the most fun I've ever had watching TV and finding and connecting the subtle clues thrown in. This season will win Many awards and has now staked it's claim as one of the best shows in history. If you haven't watched you are incredibly lucky I wish I could binge up to date. Congrats to Noah Hawley showing show runners how you come back BETTER then EVER
