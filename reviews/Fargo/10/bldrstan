OK! Fargo the movie is one of my all time favorites. Anytime I see it on the TV I will watch it. Season 1 blew me away with it's great story, superb acting by Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Allison Tolman, Colin Hanks and the rest of the cast. Each week I was glued to my seat waiting for the next surprise. Noah Hawley has done a masterful job in creating two great story lines, one for each season. I have been been binge watching season 2 on demand and cant stop. This seasons cast of Patrick Wilson, Kirsten Dunst, Ted Danson, Jean Smart etc. are doing a great job of keeping me enthralled. I definitely will be watching out for season 3.
