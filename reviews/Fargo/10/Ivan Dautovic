This is beautiful, the story, the characters and their development, killings, dark-comedy, oh I'm in love. You know those TV shows where for example you have annoying characters and you know they won't die? Well, nope, here it happens in a blink of an eye, already in the first episode. Also what is really great is that this TV show is a poetic uprise that means destruction of a man that is on the edge of being washed away. He is whipped by his wife, boss, friend, brother, everyone. And then comes a manipulative man who sets him on a path to show them who is the boss. Also acting is outstanding, what else to expect from these actors. To sum up, a beautiful poetic cold bloody masterpiece that is a must watch.
