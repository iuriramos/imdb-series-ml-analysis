I must start by commending the great piece of writing in this show. Mysterious, unpredictable, unfathomable characters and sudden plot changes keep you glued to your seat and your eyes on screen. The cast is vast and I like how they intertwine with each other and cross each other's paths in several ways. Characters share a common history in many ways. Superb dialogues, great cinematography, locations, clothing, all of which contributes to the overall image of the show. I have not seen anything like this before, the closest it matches to is True Detective but True Detective is rather more dark, grotesque and serious. I think it might become one of the important shows of this decade. And I think that the quality of television shows is increasing tremendously in general after shows like Breaking Bad and the quality in movies is sort of deteriorating and I say this because of this show.

10/10 from me.
