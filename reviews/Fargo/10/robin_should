Having watched 9 episodes of Fargo I start to wish it wasn't going to end soon. I keep this show for last on my watch list for the week as it keeps surprising me and gives 50mins of pleasure. I can only praise the writing, all the actors are brilliant, even down to the small parts. Every scene seems to have perfect lighting, making it all seem so intense, whether it's just Molly with her Dad in the coffee shop or Lorne committing some heinous act. The Cohen touch of humor manages to break the suspense at just the right time so that we, as viewers, don't get overwhelmed. I give this a 10 because I can find no faults.

I can only hope that they may, one day, see fit to give us another one of their masterpieces.
