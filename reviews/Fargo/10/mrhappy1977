I have never written a review before on IMDb but for Fargo I had to. Now a lot has been written on here saying how brilliant the show is. I agree with all of it and echo what they say. What I would like to add is I was a massive fan if the film by the same name, but the way this mini series has been put together just is aw inspiring. Billy Bob's performance is by far his best yet, deserves an award of some kind. Not anything less than 10/10 performances from the whole cast. I think because, throughout the series you are reminded this is a true story it really makes you think, and there are a lot of, "wow" and "no!" moments. Griped me from the first to the last second of the series. To some up......Awesome!
