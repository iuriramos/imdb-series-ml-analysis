I just finished the first season and I already want to watch it again. It's not for everyone, but if you appreciate dark humor, twisted irony and a few vague metaphors, give it a shot. It's unpredictable to the point of defiance; every other scene is a twist or a giant leap forward in the story of these complete sociopaths. And the bumbling police chasing them are fun to watch, along with a few hot-shots (mostly played by comedians) who end up like all the others. If you aren't familiar with the movie Fargo, you may not understand what's going on. There's a very empty feeling to every outdoor shot due to the snowy whiteout and a subtle score/soundtrack meant to build tension. If you're invested in the story, the scenery and the atmosphere compliment the "true-crime" feel of the show perfectly. All the characters feel real, even if their actions are ridiculous. Certain moments on the show will stick with you for a while, especially the gruesome bits. This is what Breaking Bad fans are gonna start watching.
