Fargo is a great new show. It starts slowly but the longer you watch it, the more it sucks you right in! When an episode ends, you're left there wanting more - and it does so in a completely fresh way. The beginning is pretty chilling but at the same time amusing. That's what Fargo does. It is story-telling in its truest form, sometimes you don't need words to explain something but then other times you can use words to explain something in a completely different way than everyone else does. Billy Bob Thornton does a great job with his character - he is malevolent, yet also likable. Same goes with Martin Freeman, who portrays Lester as a scared man, who was never good at anything but starts to 'take control of his life', as best as anyone could. The landscape in the show is amazing - snow everywhere so that you can feel the cold atmosphere at all times. The most amazing thing about this show is - characters that are supposed to be bad, are often likable, either for the humorous behaviour or by the things they do to help others. However cruel they might be, you always feel like they're not THAT bad, much like WW from Breaking Bad.
