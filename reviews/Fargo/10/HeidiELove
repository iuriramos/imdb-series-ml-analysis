The series based on the Coen brothers' Oscar-winning film begins with the arrival of Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) to Minnesota town. Lorne's actions brings major changes to the lives of insurance salesman Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman); Officer Molly Solverson (Alison Tolman), the daughter of former chief (Keith Carradine); and single father Duluth Deputy Gus Grimly (Colin Hanks). Other people in town include grocery chain owner Stavros Milos (Oliver Platt), widow Gina Hess (Kate Walsh), and Deputy Bill Oswalt (Bob Odenkirk).

This is one of the best TV shows I have seen of late. the writing is exceptional, the acting is incredible, the plot and its eccentricities are delightful and all in all an incredible Dark humor that could only be brought to success by the legendary Coen brothers. 

It is a slay ride following Thornton on his menacing path through a somewhat "simple" idealistic town. 

I could not find a better quote than from "USA Today" Robert Bianco, Apr 15, 2014 "What separates Fargo is the depth of its characterizations and the individuality of its approach". This Award Winning Series came at a pivotal time when the entertainment world thought nothing could possibly replace or have the same affect as "Breaking Bad".
