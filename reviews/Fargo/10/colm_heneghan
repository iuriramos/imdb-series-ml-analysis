Some people can't watch this because of its dark humour but I loved it. You get sucked into malvo and nygaard's actions it's hard not to watch. Brilliant acting by both billy bob and martin freeman(come a long way since his days in The Office Uk ) Hope Alison Tolman and Colin hanks continue to grow in next season. Please bring ex-chief Bill back into it(once he is finished with Better Call Saul) Have to laugh at the bimijdi/Minnesota accents and deadpan humour especially Freeman (being English) Deserves loads of awards especially Noah Hawkey for producing this magic. Good to see Coen bros. on the scene again. Love the fact season 2 is being considered ! Look forward to it already.
