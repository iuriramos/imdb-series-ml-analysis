Wow! Fantastic! Murder, mayhem plus over-the-top hilarious Minnesota-speak. If you liked the movie, you're gonna like this too. First TV episode had more action and maybe a little less comedy in the dialogue/dialect of the movie, but the Coen Bros. influence is omnipresent. One concern I have is that if the murder rate continues (4 dead in episode 1), they're gonna run outta characters by mid-season. But let's trust show's writers to overcome this hazard. Observation on Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton character): maybe it's my imagination, but I see some of Anton Chigurh ("No Country for Old Men" bad guy) in Malvo. Both are obviously sociopathic hit men whose "work" doubles as entertainment. To wit: Chigurh shoots at the crow while crossing the bridge, the fun and games with the coin toss; Malvo antagonizes one of Hess brothers against the other with fake "lawyer" phone call. Later he cons the motel janitor kid into pissing in the owner's gas tank, then makes anonymous phone call to owner to catch kid in the act. My hat is off to FX for coming up with this magnificent replacement for the season ended "Justified". Fingers crossed that subsequent episodes are as entertaining as No. 1. P.S. - Can't wait for somebody to haul a wood chipper outta the shed!
