The ten line thing is a drag and the person I want to mention would not approve because he never wasted a word. The person in question is Jim Thompson. Season one was exceptional. Season two is better. Undoubtedly the creators of this have read Thompson. He was the greatest pulp writer ever. Hard to understand why he's mostly out of print now. Special mention for Kirsten Dunst and the actors who play Floyd and Dodd but really all the writing, acting, direction and production is about as good as it ever gets. But back to Thompson (since I've got two more lines). We all know about Hammet, Chandler, Hadley Chase, Ross Macdonald and Cain, though I doubt many read them now. But Thompson was the master of writing about amoral characters.
