I saw this show quite a while back, and have waited for a few months to decide if I still like the show and it wasn't just hype-like. Spoiler alert: I still do. 

From the first episode, the show explores the characters of Lester and Lorne Malvo. Lester being the submissive salesman, and Lorne Malvo, the dominating drifter who likes to mess with people, sometimes for his own amusement. The show is witty, with many thoughtful anecdotes and not moody and has all of the subtle dark comedy that the Coen Brothers are known for. The pilot was in my opinion the best pilot to have aired since Lost. The deaths were unpredictable, and the show never felt that it was dragging itself over. I felt the ending provided a good closure for the show, and despite having many connections managed to weave them together by the finale. 

Overall, the show was brilliant, and one of the best shows of last year.
