I could have easily given a 10. When I first heard of this, I thought they were going to ruin one of my favorite movies. When I watched the first few minutes of the first episode I thought "oh no, they're ripping off the movie". By the 10 minute mark, I was fully engrossed and knew this is brilliant. I've never thought much of people in my office who rave about a television series. Now, I'm one of them. FX has it's biggest winner, in my opinion. What fascinates me even more is that it's based on a true story from 2006(?). Billy Bob Thornton reveals insight to everyday murder with some hard to deny reasoning and a wicked sense of humor. Martin Freeman's role reminds me the most of the original. He does a fine job. Allison Tollman didn't quite replicate the movie character, and that's OK. She didn't need to. She made it her own. I have never been captivated by a television series, until now. I'll change it to a 10.
