I normally think of TV as popcorn for the brain, the boob tube, etc. But, welcome to the new age of television, where a show can be as good as any movie. Fargo FX in particular is more of a mini-series than a TV show, and it's excellent. Maybe any one hour of Fargo FX is not quite as great as Fargo the movie. Maybe the first episode is a little bit rushed and little bit sick; but it's calmer as soon as the second episode. If you take all 10 episodes together, it basically gets everything right. It also explores a lot of original territory, even as it references Fargo the movie and a number of other Coen brothers movies.

You've got Lester Nygaard, who is like Jerry Lundegaard (from the movie) except not like him. Then Lorne Malvo, the evil counterpart with clear similarities to Chigurh from No Country for Old Men, except not quite like him either. Then the policewoman Molly Solverson, who is a much more complete and warmer character than Marge Gunderson (again, from the movie Fargo). Molly is a hero if there ever was one. Then the complete originals: The crazy hit men, one deaf and the other his interpreter. The two FBI agents, who actually care more about philosophy than about their jobs. The two teenage brothers who are even dumber than anyone in any Coen brothers movie. And so on.

The one minor reason to hold back is that you might ideally watch the movie first. Fargo FX is not a sequel in terms of plot, and not really a sequel in terms of characters, but it is an artistic sequel.
