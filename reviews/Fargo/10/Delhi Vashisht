I never knew about Sir "Billy Bob Thornton" until I started Fargo. I just watched 1 episode late in the night and I was so impressed that I had to take next day off from office to finish-up the complete series then and there itself. I couldn't wait till morning or next day. This's a true incident and a tragic one, so one couldn't enjoy the way story concluded or the incident happened but the way negative character has been done by Sir Billy is stupendous! His role's so strong that he'll make you fear for yourself. Negative figure with high confidence as if he's more than human!! If you're interested in watching true incidents and with one of the finest acting that you could ever imagine or would have never seen in your life then this series is for you.
