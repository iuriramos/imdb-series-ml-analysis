Billy Bob Thornton was exactly what this show needed. I saw the movie but it didn't captivate me like this mini-series did. The writer combined with the actors/actresses were perfectly matched. There is no way I could miss a single week. I didn't want to miss an episode because every single one was intriguing. What was going to happen next? Who was Malvo going to get rid of next? He seemed to elude authorities constantly and it seemed impossible for them to locate him although he was in plain sight. The character of Lester was hilarious yet sneaky. How could there be very little suspicion cast upon him especially when his 2nd wife was murdered! I can't imagine what other true thrilling stories this writer can come up with to share with the world, but I hope the powers that be will allow it. I never viewed the movie with as much enthusiasm as I did this TV series. Please give us a 2nd season!!
