It is just so good, perfect story, perfect acting, and perfect pictures.

Every detail in Fargo is well thought and utterly entertaining, especially season 2 is just brilliant. The violence, the action, directing, split screens, the humor is just so thrilling and takes you deep inside the world of Minnesota in 1979, I just Love it.

It's like every move or picture in Fargo is a well written and well directed piece of art. And the best thing about it the actors are the color which gives the picture it's glance.

I know I may sound like a fan-boy but I think it is a perfect series. Best TV series 2015.
