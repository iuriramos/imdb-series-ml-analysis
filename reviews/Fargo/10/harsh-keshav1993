I was Skceptical about the show when i started watching it as i had found Fargo the movie rather overrated and i knew the show would take some references from it;but boy oh boy,the pilot simply blew me away.

This being the golden era in U.S. television,you involuntarily expect something special from almost every show that has a stellar cast like Fargo.And this was quite special. The writing was worthy of something like a Pulitzer. Episode after episode they had something brilliant to show. the acting was superb with no exceptions. Martin freeman did the accent quite well. Billy Bob Thornton exceeded all expectations and delivered a performance to behold.

In a sea of TV shows all claiming to be the next big thing,Fargo is a quiet,beautiful mermaid waiting and deserving to be appreciated.
