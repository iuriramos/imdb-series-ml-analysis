Second series of Fargo is one of the best TV shows I have ever seen. For me the first episode was a bit hard to swallow with all the visual story telling retro-avant garde. However, once you get used to it, the story and the cast is breathtaking right from the start.

The parallels of the touching family story, the story of the criminals by accident and the war of the gangs all framed by a series of deus-ex-machina UFO apparitions is just amazing!

The contrasts between the Kansas City Gang, Solverson, Gerhard and the Blumquist family characters are crowned by the incredible performance of Kirsten Dunst as Peggy Blumquist and her male counterpart Jesse Plemons as Ed the butcher whose absurd love story just blew my mind from the beginning till the end. 

The 2nd series is thrilling, dark and incredibly funny at the same time. It pulls you into the depicted era and the almost biblical/magical realism/mini-saga, which tackles deep subjects like values in life, the nature of good&evil, bravery&cowardice and the sources of conflicts between people on so many levels.
