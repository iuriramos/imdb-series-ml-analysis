I have just recently watched the eighth episode of Season 2 of Fargo and have decided to finally write a review of the entire series, because I think it deserves all the praise under the sun. It is truly gripping drama, and despite to different character's between seasons, the show has stood fast and actually matured in the genre with more grueling scenarios and intense exchanges.

Noah Hawley's first adaption from the film in Season 1 was spectacular, exhibiting confident persona for its many characters and pushing them to the very edge of their emotions until they become genuine human beings. To envision that, you had Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman and Alison Tolman acting their socks off with superb conviction, so much so that they fell into their characters like naturals, each with their own defining personality. Whilst depicting these striking events and how it effects the town of Bemidji, sails to highs above many other television series, not just in its genre, but further afield too. It's witty, it's dark and above all triumphant for not being afraid of pushing the boundaries.

Now, in Season 2, I've reached the point where I haven't got enough energy to praise the entire spectacle that is Fargo. The cast is outstanding, ranging from downright hilarious to bloody terrifying (I'm referring to Nick Offerman and Zahn MzClarnon, who aren't even the main characters by the way). The direction is unique and experimental (my favourite kind), with the new method of splitting the screen to allow different perspectives for all the characters. Lastly, the writing is genius, with witty one-liners and unpredictable developments. One minute we're laughing at the best joke in the world, and then crying at the loss of our favourite character (even if he is the bad guy).

If there's any TV show that deserves an Emmy this year, it's Fargo (and I don't just mean one). Absolutely stunning to watch - and I've still got two more episodes to watch.
