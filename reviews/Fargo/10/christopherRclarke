Review of S1. 

Many of the negative reviews you will read on here talk about the 'senseless' violence in this TV series. Perhaps they should stick to watching The Sound of Music or I Love Lucy. 

The first season does amazing justice to the film, similar in many ways with lots of classic tie ins. The humour is also the same and Bill Bob does an outstanding job as a villain. His dark humour and classic one liners are etched in time. Martin Freeman is as good if not better in this than the Sherlock series. I hold new respect as him for an actor since the Hobbit film series was terrible.

Allison Tolman is a great actor, and comes across alluring and strong. All supporting actors are fantastic and classical comical, keeping to the same theme as the film. 

I have watched the first season three times and ready to put it back on again. Season 2 is also great, not the same theme as the Fargo film but still classic in its nature and references to the film and first season.
