After the conclusion of the first season I'm am absolutely sure that this show will be remembered for it's amazing writing,perfect acting, dark and fascinating subject material, and comedic tie ins. If you enjoyed the film by the coen brothers then you will, without a doubt, love this show. In my opinion it far surpasses the movie in excellence. 

It tells the story of a loser who's wife doesn't love him and regrets marrying him. He accidentally tells a hit man (played expert by Billy Bob Thornton) to kill a bully of his. Things escalate from here in a comepletely amazing spectacle of coincidences and murder that will keep you in the need of another episode.

If you like anti hero stories like breaking bad, dexter, and The Sopranos then I'm sure you will fall in love with this quirky and mysterious show. I can't wait to see what happens in season 2.
