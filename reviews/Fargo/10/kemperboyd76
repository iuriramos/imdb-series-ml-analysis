As a huge fan of the Coen brothers 1996 original, it's accurate to say that I approached this particular series with a mixture of emotions... Fear, dread, terror that those involved might destroy the legacy of said original & curiosity, hope and excitement that something special may be waiting.

I was absolutely thrilled to discover that Fargo is nothing short of a revelation. 4 episodes in and it's fast becoming one of my all time favourite series. It contains everything the title promised... an incredible script, wonderful direction, beautiful cinematography, oddball characters performed brilliantly by an outrageously talented cast and more charm, dark humour, pathos and style than you'd see in a dozen average productions.

Of the terrific cast, a special mention must go to Billy Bob Thornton as the hilariously malevolent Lorne Malvo, a weird hybrid of Anton Chigurh and Rumpelstiltskin.

So with my fears well and truly banished, I eagerly look forward to bathing in Fargo's brilliance and splendour for weeks and years to come.
