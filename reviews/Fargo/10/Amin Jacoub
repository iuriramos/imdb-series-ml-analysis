As a big Breaking Bad fan I was reading that Brfeaking Bad will define how the future TV shows will be created. It meant in a way that will upgrow even movies. And yes, the Fargo came, and it really proves that the new era of high quality TV show raised. I was quite a fan of the movie Fargo, but Fargo TV show looks better to me, having even more bizarre elements and overall context. I was actually amazed how god this show is, not to mention casting one the best actors from movie world. Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thornton made an impeccable performances, but hell, all of other actors also do. Collin Hanks, Bob Odnekirk, Oliver Platt. Simply awesome performances. I liked how they made a connection with the movie Fargo, yet it is so richer in details, conversations and overall plot, mush better and unique. Bizarre, unusual and funny with dark comedy elements and real violence was a great way to make it as a TV masterpiece. Not everyone will admire though. All that would not be made so good, I believe, without legendary Coen Brothers as a producers. Their influence is obvious, and that quotes and conversations by Lorne Malvo reminds me on Anton Chigurh from "No Country for Old Men" (at the gas station). Every episode is made very tensed and rich, and the whole story rise to its peak that simply leaves you breathless. The ending is supposing to be like that, and what I can say is that I am exciting for the Season 2. I believe they will cast some memorable persons like it was in the first season. Spectacular.
