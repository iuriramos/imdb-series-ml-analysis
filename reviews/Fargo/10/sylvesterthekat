This series blew me away. That it's based on true events probably gives it added gravitas that a made up story would not possess because you'd think it was perhaps a bit OTT. But this stuff happened! 

The cast are superb, there's not a wrong-un among them. The actress who played the dogged cop Molly was outstanding and I hope we see her in more shows to come. Everything was pitch perfect, from the accents to the actors. Billy Bob Thornton gave us his best work in years, he totally brought the improbably evil character Lorne Malvo to life and Martin Freeman was utterly believable as the inept insurance salesman at the hub of the tale.

I don't want to give anything away so can't really say too much more about it other than to say do. not. miss. this. The finale is so freaking awesome you just won't believe what you're seeing.
