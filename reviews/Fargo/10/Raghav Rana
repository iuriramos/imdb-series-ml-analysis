Given the tough job of emulating the success of the movie by the Coen brothers, Noah Hawley has done what many thought was the unachievable and created something that is equal, if not better than the 1996 classic bearing the same name. 

The fantastic visuals and irresistible soundtrack is accompanied by fresh writing and brilliant acting. With each season being self contained as a miniseries, the writers are able to create a gripping storyline which encompasses you as a viewer. Season 1 follows the journey of Lester Nygaard from an emasculated male to becoming a cold hearted killer. With the same wit and dark humour that the movie possessed, Fargo creates the aura of reality and a certain terrifying and chilling aspect, initially provoked by the initial warning before every episode. Perhaps the greatest aspect of Fargo, for which it has become synonymous with is its unexpected bursts of violence. These horrific acts give the feeling that no one is safe and has you legitimately fearing for the characters life, exceptional edge of your seat viewing. The writers of the show deserve great applause for their ability to explore and flesh out the flaws of each character and have you confused for which character you want to live or die. 

Fargo represents what is truly great about the golden age of television. With its impeccable score and amazing visuals it delivers a final product which deserves to be ranked amongst one of the modern greats.
