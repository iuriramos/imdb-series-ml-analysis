Season 1 and Season 2 are amazing.

In every sense: amazingly written, perfectly shot, great performances: beautiful production around the scene.

And trust me, pay attention to the writing. I can't say more, without fear of adjusting the experience. I'm planning to write a more in- depth spoiler version and critique of the piece.

It stays true to the movie. In every scene. And expands.

One thing I particularly find interesting, film wise, is the incredible use of parallelisms and tangents in the story.

Just perfectly timed and balanced.

I can't say more. Just watch it and find out for yourself.
