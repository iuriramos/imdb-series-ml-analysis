In an age overcrowded by reboots and remakes, re-imaginings and derivative products, it's heartening to see such a creation as Fargo, the TV show. Did this need to exist? Absolutely not, and it smartly avoids any commonality with the original Coen classic beyond the setting and the tone. It is « inspired by » Fargo, in the best sense of the word, because it somehow captures the essence of the Coen's snowy surreal thriller and applies it to arguably a more interesting story. 

Season 1 begins in deceptively comfortable territory, very close in spirit to its predecessor and following an underachieving loser with a convoluted, slightly nasty scheme. Here, the winning ingredient, once you get past the perfect emulation of tone and language, is the starring combination of Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thornton. The former's unfortunately named protagonist is less pathetic than William H Macy's inspiration, and develops a meaner edge. The latter is simply terrifying. It is a strong testament to these two actors' great work here that they manage to outshine the amazing turns from the rest of the cast.

Season 2 goes the True Detective route by starting fresh with new characters and story. Unlike that other show, free from its source, it reaches even greater heights of originality, poetry and madness. The highest compliment one can probably make is that, in an age of quality television, it raises the bar significantly. If it only meets its own standards next year, the upcoming season will be a real treat.

The best thing on the small screen right now.
