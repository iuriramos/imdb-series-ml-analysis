The Series Fargo is amazing. Nothing much else to say actually. The mini series is filled with quality acting, terrific soundtrack, and an amazing script. Every scene in Fargo seems to hold a kind of weight on the story, and if it doesn't, it's developing a character. I have not seen the original movie named Fargo, but because of this series I will. After watching a series like Breaking Bad, I really thought my expectations were high, but this series is on a completely different level. Billy Bob Thornton's character was played perfectly, and so was Freeman's, in the end I feel they both did their best with the characters, and it was a job well done. Thank you Coen Brothers, for ten episodes of quality served on ablu-ray disc.
