Considering that I think Fargo the movie is one of the best of all time, I wasn't sure if the TV show would measure up. But it did indeed! It feels very much like the movie, but still has its own completely different storyline. I'm amazed by the detail, the quirkiness, and the humor of the story. Great job! There's a great job done with casting. Billy Bob Thornton is just awesome as the evil Malvo. The characters are very well written and a delight to watch. Spoiler: Episode four pays homage to the movie linking the two story lines. See if you catch it. If you love quirky, funny, and dark mysteries, this one will blow you away. I can't wait to see the series finale coming up next week.
