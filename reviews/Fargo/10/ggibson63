This show is surprisingly amazing. I didn't expect much from this show when I first started watching it, but right off the bat, the first episode left my mouth hanging open in shock. It was so intense and so much happened in the first episode! Then after the first episode, the season gradually keeps building and building with suspense. Malvo is an evil genius, and he's easily one of my favorite "villains" of all time. He's so manipulative and sneaky, I just love it. This show reminds me of a combination of Breaking Bad and Bates Motel. Lester's character reminds me of Walter White in a way, how he used to be so innocent and nobody treated him with respect, but as his character develops he becomes a bad ass. I just can't wait to see what Malvo does next! It's quickly become one of my new favorite TV shows. Billy Bob Thornton does an incredible job as Malvo, and I don't think anyone could play Malvo as good as he does. His character gives me the creeps in the best way. I really hope there is a second season, even though I know this is a mini- series, but it's so good and I'm not ready to give it up. My favorite episode of the season has to be episode 6 because it was so intense and I was shocked and in tears and it was an emotional roller coaster. Sure, this show can seem slow at times, but it's all build up for the intense, dramatic, and amazing scenes coming up (which is another similarity to Breaking Bad). I just really love this show and I don't want to see it end.
