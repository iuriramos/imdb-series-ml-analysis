As an lover of the original film, there is always skepticism with a show like this. After watching the pilot episode I must say that it was a very enjoyable watch. The dark and sometimes humor filled tone of the original in transported into the series through clever and quick dialogue. The characters are casted very well with Billy Bob Thornton brilliantly dark whilst Martin Freeman is great as Lester Nygaard. Fans of the 1994 original will enjoy the pilot immensely as it inter-twines the same feeling as the Coen Brothers movie. It's good that the Coen brothers have involvement with this project as I'm sure it will help the future episodes stay true to the source material.I can't wait for the next episode and I'm sure it will be a great first season. 10/10 (pilot)
