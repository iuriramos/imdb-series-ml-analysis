Fargo contains some of the best storytelling and characters on TV. The Coen brothers influence can be felt throughout the series. It's violent, funny and sometimes absurd(especially in season 2).

Noah Hawley and his crew are in the realm of genius that was found in Vince Gilligan and his crew. The writing is superb with slow- building tension in the second season. Fargo surpasses expectations in its technical prowess. Everything from set design, cinematography, costumes and dialogue is meticulously arranged in great periodic detail. The cast is perfectly chosen with Patrick Wilson, Kirsten Dunst, Ted Danson and Nick Offerman being the standouts. The villainous roles are perfectly executed with wit, humor and outright strangeness. The interesting Minnesota characters are masters of passive aggression. Polite exteriors cover a very violent displacement which makes for great characters and television

Fargo has the production values of film but it still remains grounded. The film was great but the series is excellent. Fargo deserves all the acclaim and awards it's getting. It is one of the shows that make the phrase "Golden Era of Television" plausible.
