To say this FX series is better than the movie is a huge understatement, trust me when I tell you, I loved the movie, I've seen it countless times and it's that type of movie that is just timeless, if you're flipping thru the channels and come across it, you just have to watch it to the end from what ever point you catch it, just a great things go from bad to worse story, this series tops it in every aspect, I guarantee you'll remember Billy Bob Thornton's Lorne Malvo just like you remember Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter and Heath Ledger's The Joker as the perfect Master Manipulator villain, the series storyline even intertwines with The storyline from the Fargo movie in a perfect way, it has that tension that grabs you and you know something bad is going to happen, the series feels close enough to the Fargo movie but much darker, more graphically violent than the movie and just great character writing, there is talk that this series will be much like The True Detective series, where they use different actors every year to tell different tales, one of my all time favorite series, damn near perfect, ACES >> 2 Thumbs up!
