ref Season 2

The show switches from dark comedy of season one to a much more complex gangster story full loaded of black humor, awesome acting and tributes to Coen Bros Cinema. Cinematic is pretty different from the one we saw in season one, but yet one of the best and smartest in modern TV show. So if Season one was exceptional, season two doubles the scores. I've really appreciated also the way the first couple of episode smoothly takes you from the "family's interiors" ambiance of season one to western open space of season two. Some episodes (in fact, most of them) are so well done and worthy that can stand by themselves as excellent action/drama movies. Simply superb!
