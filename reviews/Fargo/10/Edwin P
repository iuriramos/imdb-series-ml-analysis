Fargo is great.

Pros: Just the right amount of humor. Just the right amount of intensity. Just the right amount of weird.

Cons: None

A roller coaster ride of a show. Sets up scenes beautifully. The characters are not your average theater heroic type. They have typical human traits, which is what draws you to them. It has a dull atmosphere, and for that reason everything that occurs is just that much more extreme.

Do watch.
