From the very start with that drive down the cold empty road to that beautiful finish, the first season of this was incredible. It's amongst the best of television and kept me counting the days till the next episode.

The only things that links this to the original Fargo (1996) are that its set in the same world, has similar themes and the same setting. Other than this the story is unique, following how Malvo begins to change everything as if he were rotting them from inside and tries to ruin the lives of everyone he can with little care.

All the dialogue is very intelligently written with a great natural feel to it. With this dialogue comes an effective mix of both dark comedy and beautiful drama constantly putting the characters in unique situations. 

Probably the shows strongest players are Freeman with his brilliant descent from a quiet husband into a sinister man and Thornton who's ability to manipulate mixed with a cold calculating persona will make you shiver in your spine. Both of them give one of the strongest performances of their respective careers. Certainly the shows best moments are their shared scenes as the two share a great chemistry together which make for many intense and funny moments. 

On top of this the setting is beautiful with incredible shots of the Tundra wilderness and it's vast landscape throughout the show. The cinematography used is possibly some of the best I've ever seen on television with a sense of emptiness giving the show a distinct and interesting feel. 

It's unpredictable, tragic, beautiful and a clear demonstration of how to do TV right. I can only hope that the next series will keep to the same brilliance as the first.
