This series is excellent! Great scenery shots, very good acting performances. The story has got some elements of the original movie, but it's going a different road. You can see the hand of masters. By masters, I mean the Coen Brothers. They are special in the movie business and their works translate well to TV series.

I Loved the acting of Billy Bob Thornton. His modest approach of his character made it something totally new. His Dialogues are brilliant, but his long hypothetical monologues are genius! Martin Freemand does what he does best. He is perfect for the role he's playing. You can feel the anger inside building up. Waiting for that fateful moment that he's losing control of the beast inside of him. I think that a lot of people will recognize his character.

The only point of critique I have is the 'Hollywood Ending'. All the bad guys go down and the world is in balance again. That's a shame, because it doesn't add up with the realistic view through these series. It also cuts the road for a sequel.

This series is a must see!
