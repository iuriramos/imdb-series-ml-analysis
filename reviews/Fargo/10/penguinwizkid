I absolutely adored Breaking Bad and was very sad after its finale. For months I searched and searched to find the "next" show. True Detective was solid but it's 8 episodes did little to satiate my appetite. Then I found Fargo. From the pilot I knew this show was going to be insane and incredible and it hasn't let up at ALL over the course of the season. The acting is superb and the plot intricate and compelling. The wait for Sherlock to return is NOT fun, but Martin Freeman's brilliant work as Lester is helping me get by. Billy Bob Thornton is also at his best in every episode. I'm already dreading the wait before next season, but I know I'll make it somehow. At this point it's not quite as good as Breaking Bad got to be at the end, but I say Fargo is already better than the first few years of BB and has no where to go but up. Everyone should get watching this show because in a few years, everyone will be watching it. I love it and can't wait for season 2! FX has really stepped their game up recently.
