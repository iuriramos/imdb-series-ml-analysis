Let me first start out by saying that Fargo has some of the best acting i have seen in a TV show yet. All the cast from Martin Freeman to Patrick Wilson knocks it out of the park. For those who don't know Fargo is an American Black Comedy Drama Series on the Network Series Fx. Let me get right to it and say that. The writing is so funny and quirky, its a very dark comedy drama that just doesn't let you off the edge of your seat. This is my first review for a TV show or movie ever and i feel that Fargo really deserves a 10/10, if you've never seen this show i would highly recommend it. The Directing is very coen brothers style, it really gives you that western type feel. Nothing that i have seen throughout my days of binge watching has kept me engaged in the story and the characters as much as Fargo has.While Shows like Breaking Bad and Lost have those amazing characters and story, it doesn't feel like its setting itself is a character like Fargo, you feel that everything is connected and theirs a bigger message its showing you. Overall Fargo is a must have TV experience for any TV show lovers out their.
