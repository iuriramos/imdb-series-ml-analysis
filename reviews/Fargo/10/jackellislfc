There aren't many TV series that I can become fixated too. Fargo is my only exception. I cant honestly say that I have ever watched anything more intriguing, exciting and enjoyable. With countless plot twists, superb acting and scenes that stir with your emotions Fargo certainly can't go without a miss. Staring Martin Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton and Colin Hanks (Tom Hank's son) it doesn't boast an A-list of star celebrities but I must say their acting in extremely complex roles was superbly executed. If your bored of the typical and slightly predictable shows like Walking Dead and House of Cards then take some time out to watch this. I promise you won't regret it.
