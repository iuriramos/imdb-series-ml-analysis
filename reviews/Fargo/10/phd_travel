There is a lot to like about this miniseries. There is a host of quirky lovable characters villains and heroes, cute accents, and dark comedy interspersed with a crime drama. Like many fans of Breaking Bad who were looking for something to fill the void - this is it. Not as intense, it is more comedy than drama. The story is original, well crafted and makes you feel for the different characters.

Like the 90s movie this is set in a frozen landscape with the kind, quaint characters with their Minnesota accents. Billy Bob Thornton plays Lorne a contract killer in a role perfectly suited for his comic and dramatic skills. Martin Freeman (showing so much more real acting than in the Hobbit) plays Lester a victim type who gets his own back with the aid of Lorne. Just as with Walter White, I was still rooting for Lester no matter what bad things he did. Allison Tollman plays a kind smart policewoman and Colin Hanks a policeman. Breaking Bad fans look out for a different looking Saul (Bob Odenkirk) playing a na√Øve police chief. Good support from Kate Walsh in a small role and Keith Carradine.

Deserved to win the Emmy and Golden Globe. Looking forward to next season.
