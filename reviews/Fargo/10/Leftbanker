Another remarkable series set apart from the herd by good acting and terrific casting. The two seasons thus far have been completely different and equally entertaining. I hope they can keep this up. This is yet another series that makes me bored with feature movies and their totally formulaic approach to storytelling. What I love the most about Fargo is that it is wildly unpredictable at every turn in the story. Because it is a series they have the time to develop some really strong characters even if they aren't even central to the story.

I didn't even put two and two together to link Jeffrey Donovan who plays Dodd Gerhardt with the dude from Burn Notice (not a bad series but not in this league). I had to look him up on IMDb to make this connection. I think that shows that he's a pretty good actor.
