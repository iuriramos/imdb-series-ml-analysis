Sometimes it felt like the work of some brilliant foreign director when in fact two extraordinary American filmmakers, Joel and Ethan Cohen, united by blood and art, are at helm, giving us a powerful glimpse into an America that seems totally new and strangely familiar at the same time. Tender without ever falling into sentimentality. Horrific and enchanting. I feel terrible I hadn't seen this masterpiece until now. I don't have any valid excuses. It just happened. Now, "Fargo" has become one of my favorite American films of all time. Every moment is "a moment" without pretension or subterfuge. Frances McDormand is, quite simply, sublime. Every character, William H Macy, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare in particular, create characters that will linger in my mind, for better or worse, always. What a treat!
