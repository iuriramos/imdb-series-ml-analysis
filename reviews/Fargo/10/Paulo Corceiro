Loved the series. I watched all ten episodes and then right after it I took in my old DVD movie and watched it too. Subtle references to original work are delicious, the script, the actors, the dialogue, the atmosphere, all this is built on an ingenious way! It is better than many of the films of the famous Coen brothers. Do not know how you can keep the attention of TV viewers in the second season but I will be here waiting, do it quickly please... The Lorne Malvo character is amazingly solid and weird but I have been a Billy Bob Thornton's fan for a long time, loved his work on another Coen movie - "The Man Who Wasn't There" (2001).
