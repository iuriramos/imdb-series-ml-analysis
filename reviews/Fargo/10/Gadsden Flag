Crime thrillers don't get any better than this. Martin Freeman plays (with flawless American accent) a henpecked salesman who snaps. Billy Bob Thornton made my skin crawl as a sociopathic hit man. The filming and storytelling techniques are arty and fresh, but the theme is timeless: good vs evil. 

I liked this series even better than the film (with France McDormand) that told the same story a few years back. The season-long format allowed deeper character development and more room for pure style.

Each episode of Fargo begins with a message on the screen, saying the story is true and that actual events unfolded just as they are shown. This is incorrect. The crime happened, but the TV series actually takes liberties with the facts for storytelling purposes. Not a deal breaker for me, but a manipulative thing for the show's creators to say.
