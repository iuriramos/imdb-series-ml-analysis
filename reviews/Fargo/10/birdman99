Awesome, just awesome. Never seen the Movie but intend to watch it after just switching off the TV to this, i can honestly say Billy Bob Thornton character in this must be the scariest character i have ever seen on TV. He gives me the spokes especially in the final scene Season 1, episode 10.

Anyway watch this when your off work one day pretending to be ill. Its a great 10 hours of TV, in fact, no its not a TV show but more a 10 hour movie. Fantastic. Only one fault and that was after ep 5 the story line seems to stall , it soon picks up again and gives you one more go off the roller coaster.
