Post breaking bad, I had no hope of ever seeing another good crime drama. Fargo almost appeared from nowhere and boy..!! what a relief. This show has a gem of actor , Billy Bob Thornton and Sherlock famed actor Martin Freeman, and for the Breaking Bad fanatics, Bob Odenkirk(Saul Goodman) is regular on the show too. They have new girl, Allison Tollman playing the lady officer along with Tom Hanks's kid Colin Hank giving a superb supporting actors performance.

From the go,you know this one is going to be a bumpy ride as Malvo hits a deer and a man in underwear jumps out of the car's trunk. From there on bodies keep piling up and its up to Deputy Molly to catch the culprits as her own family life comes in the danger too. Music keeps pace with the drama and is able to get the suspense going and Minnesota's small sleepy town and with quiet outdoors provides the best setting for ultra-violent crime drama.
