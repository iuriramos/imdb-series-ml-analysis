This show is perfect.2 seasons,20 episodes and 2 separate sagas with a talented cast.How often do you see something like this? Not much really.Let's start with the first season.

The characters are the true strength in the first series,especially Lorne Malvo.A very interesting character with a devil-may-care attitude.The way Martin Freeman's character evolves from an unconfident and clumsy klutz to a very sinister murderer is very interesting.Allison Tolman plays her part nicely but cannot match the skill of the two main leads.The story is amazing and thoroughly unpredictable.You can never ever see what is coming.Story changes are everywhere and the characters give it a quirky boost.

Gonna start the second season now,and expecting a lot.I hope the third season is good as well.
