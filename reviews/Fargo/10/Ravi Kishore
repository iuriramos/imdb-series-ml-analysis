Open your heart to evil and Fargo follows. Fargo is a dark and haunting story, beautifully told with brutal honesty. It will sadden your very soul. Still watch it, and you'll appreciate life, truth and goodness with a new perspective.

I could write pages with adjectives for Fargo, but suffice to say that It will stir something deep inside you. Isn't that what all great works of art do ? 

PS - Fargo does full justice to the movie. When the first season ended I could almost hear Marge saying, "...And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day. Well. I just don't understand it. "
