I fell in love with Fargo instantly after I finished the pilot. It has been long since The Silence of the Lamb that I can feel the tense. This show deserves more love.

With bland and smooth theme, Fargo takes a brave step which many take and failed, making the audiences feel. While the plot is incredibly good and making sense, what makes the shows memorable, is its calm and quirky style. The creators manage to put a lot in an extremely simple story, themes and mixtures of emotion, told by the strangest way they could come up with. During some scenes the show just want to mess you up and you would just rather feel it than to have it making sense. The only show I know that had pulled the same approach is Twin Peaks. Fargo possesses much of Coen's signatures. But even if you have not seen the film Fargo, you shouldn't miss this. A pure cinematic experience.
