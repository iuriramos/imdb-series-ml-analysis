It is a great show, truly. I just can not understand how there are so few people that heard of it. It is, maybe, the best show since Breaking Bad(not including True Detective because the 2nd season was no match for the first). Meanwhile, there we have Fargo with a second season, even better than the first one, with a much complex story and way more characters and typologies of people. The only thing that I feel it was a miss is the presence of a character such as Lorne Malvo from the first series. Ooh, I almost forgot, it is way more rewarding than the movie. Also, the action does not happen in Fargo-the city but in areas around Fargo. That is why the mechanism of this show is somehow the mechanism of cell. In this instance, Fargo represents the nucleus, the thing that makes other things move. It affects all those around it, it implements rules and laws.
