While it's fresh in my mind I figure I would weigh in. I almost wish I didn't see the movie...Perhaps then, I could appreciate the darkness of this show better.

If you want to see a documentary on the mundane, then this is the show for you. But, it seems that is reaching for something the whole time...I mean, a show should be unique in design, message and characterizations. I have seen the main characters before...They are the embodiment of the Fargo Movies' characters. 

So why am I watching it? Or better still, why are you? It is entertaining in essence, that I will grant! If you want to kill an hour with something that makes you shrug your shoulders or you only enjoy mild stimulation, intellectually, then by all means...Have at it...Just my opinion...

UPDATE; 6/27 Boy what a noodnick I was...I stayed with the show and Boy am I glad I did...It is impossible not to like it...So, Basically, I was an idiot and Billy Bob should scorn me personally...: D Great show! Derp!
