I've watched this from the first episode to the last and it was mind-blowing brilliant. The Drama, The Suspense, everything about it is 100% AWESOME! I really did not want it to end, it WAS that good. I do not care if the events were real or not, it was acting of the highest level and the entire production team, no sorry, everyone involved should receive an honor. Recording this outside a studio building was a big winner, the countryside was beautiful the scenery was just stunning....... If there are better out there I've yet to see them. Congratulations on a fantastic series.
