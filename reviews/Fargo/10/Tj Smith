Right from the beginning I knew this would be a Fantastic TV Series. Best acting Iv'e seen in a TV show in a long time I wish that more shows would be based off of old movies. Also it was a great idea that they brought the Coen Brothers back for this show.

Warning Spoiler Alert: Just some awesome attributes to this first episode. A man is seen frozen to death. 

A man kills another man by stabbing him in the back of the head while he's having sex. He spits up blood on the prostitute and falls on top of her. 

A man beats his wife to death with a hammer. This scene is sudden and intense as the first strike comes out of nowhere. She stands in shock with blood trickling down her head. He later hits her across the face and begins beating her multiple times. You later see the graphic aftermath. 

So there was a lot of thought put into this Series and just the best acting hands down Iv'e seen in a TV show in a long while.

Thumbs up!! 10/10
