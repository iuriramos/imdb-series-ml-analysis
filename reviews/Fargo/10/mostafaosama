Fargo is hilarious mix between the crime genre and the comedy one. i cannot remember me having good time watching a TV series as this, of course after breaking bad. 

the cast and the direction are the magical things behind this masterpiece.billy bob Thornton is the a legend. by all means, this man is a real hero when it comes to acting skills, his performance was far from being over and far from being normal. for me, i think that the golden globe he got was just normal reaction for his performance. 

and when it comes to martin freeman it is exactly the same. after knowing that martin is going to be in this series i just couldn't understand why they involve a man with different accent from the region.

actually, after 15 minutes from the first episode i got really shocked from his way of acting. he was, for me, the best one when it comes to making comedy in the series. he makes me feel really that i could enjoy crime series with a very considerable amount of comedy that can never pull you out of the plot.

lastly, this is a very rare masterpiece you really do not wanna miss. And it is more than highly recommended if you are a fan of a great acting underneath the control a spectacular director
