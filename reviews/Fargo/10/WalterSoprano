I think I may have spoken too soon as far as calling true detective the best new show of the year because this show hits it far out of the park and does it in good form. Martin freeman, billy bob Thornton, Colin hanks, and the list goes on and on and as far as everyone on the list (which involves the majority of the cast members) they all gave great performances.

Probably the best thing about this show is the story. It is clever, un predictable, very original, and immensely interesting. The writing and directing are both great as well. There are plenty of twists, shocks, and subplots to keep you interested.

If you are a Coen brothers fan or just a fan of the original film fargo then this show is an absolute must see for you. I won't guarantee you'll have satisfaction because believe me it never fails for somebody to be disappointed. But other wise I would recommend this show to almost everybody unless you aren't a fan of crime/dramas or black comedies because believe me this show has a great concoction of both. Otherwise enjoy.
