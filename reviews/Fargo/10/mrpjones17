I am a huge fan of the Fargo franchise. The movie was phenomenal and I wasn't really sure what to expect when I started to watch the TV show. Let's start with the first season. Great cast, amazing writing, and there was always something going on. There was so much characterization and it all flowed so perfectly. Martin Freeman was incredible playing the shy, done with life insurance salesman. And Billy Bob Thorton as one of the most interesting characters the Noah Hawley has created. The first season so good leading to the second, and I loved how it flowed with the movie. Maybe a few dull parts but I give it a 9.1/10. I'd say it was very underrated. As great as the first season was, it paled in comparison to the second. The second is a must see for everyone who watched TV. One of the best pieces of writing ever done. It is about a great story about feuds between a mafia, couple, and the police. It escalates every episode and the acting was incredible. There are a lot of familiar faces and seeing all of them at one of their best is great to see. It was really great how it went with the first season as well. Overall, this is one of the best shows that has ever been on television. It is very deserving of being in the top 10 greatest shows and very entertaining for anyone.
