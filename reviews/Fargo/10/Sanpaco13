Rarely does a show pull me in like this one did. I watch a lot of shows that are entertaining enough, but this one has just jumped into my top 10. I loved the movie Fargo and have always been a fan of crime dramas and dark comedies. Each episode of season 1 had at least one or two "oh sh*t" moments and I mean like red wedding or pushing reporters onto train tracks kind of moments. Billy Bob Thornton brings probably his best role ever as the psychopath Lorne Malvo. I loved the many homages to some of the great scenes from the movie such as the "I changed my mind" moment at the parking garage and the money buried under a red ice scraper. This last one and several other subtle hints lead me to believe that these events all take place in the same universe as that of the movie and that there is some continuity from the 1987 story and the 2006-07 story. The soundtrack, the characters, the atmosphere, everything stays completely true to the movie without ripping it off. I absolutely loved the first season and am looking forward to more.
