I have never seen the Coen Brothers' film. This means that I am not going to compare it to the 1996 film version of 'Fargo'. I am reviewing the TV series. Which is phenomenal. When I first heard about the series, I had no idea how they were going to fill 10 one hour episodes based on what originally seemed to be a very simple plot. I admit to being sceptical, but how wrong I was! From the first episode, the series adopts a sinister, dark undertone which is maintained throughout. This is chiefly done through the incredible Billy Bob Thornton. His role as Lorne Malvo is both terrifying and hilarious at the same time. The way that he sends a chill running down your spine while you are grinning is a feat that few actors have ever accomplished.

Despite a rather dodgy accent that sometimes sounds Irish, Martin Freeman is also a wonder to watch. He plays the role of Lester Nygard brilliantly and his emotion and deterioration of his mental stability is portrayed perfectly. From the first episode, Freeman shows us that he is not Bilbo Baggins or Arthur Dent any more- he is a murderer and a liar. The moment he smashes his wife's head with a hammer a change is seen and it is fantastic.

The brutality of the murders and the evil of Malvo is what makes this black comedy so sinister yet so very funny. The way that Thornton keeps a dead-pan face while slitting throats or stabbing people is perfect. Alison Tollman and Colin Hanks are also superb as the law enforcers with some brilliant lines and facial expressions. Overall the series' cast makes this drama an incredible viewing experience.

Finally, witnessing such incredible effects and fake death astonishes throughout and really does make watching the series feel like you are watching a 10-hour movie. If the film is even close to being as good as this, then I cannot wait to see it!
