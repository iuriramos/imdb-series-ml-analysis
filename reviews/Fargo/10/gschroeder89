Fargo is one of my favorite television shows of all time. Being of a younger generation, my parents would occasionally quote the original movie FARGO when talking about their favorite movies. The only thing I knew about the movie was that poster of the murdered cop lying in the snow. So when I heard it was being turned into a show, I took the opportunity to watch the season premier. I was instantly hooked. I was intrigued. I was horrified. I knew I was going to be in for an emotional, crazy ride.

I don't like to write reviews that are all positive, but I really don't have anything bad to say about this show. Each episode is a 50 minute movie the progresses the plot. Even with 1 or 2 slower episodes, every episode is crucial for the finale. The character development is amazing. The acting and writing is spot on. The music works perfectly to keep you on your seat. Billy Bob Thornton just became one of my new favorite actors. FARGO keeps the drama and thrills to the very end. You don't watch FARGO, you are apart of it.

If you are looking for a show that is deep, thought provoking, and thrilling, FARGO is the show. It will make you think about society and crime. It does not spoon feed you. You have to make the decision. What if they are wrong, and you are right?
