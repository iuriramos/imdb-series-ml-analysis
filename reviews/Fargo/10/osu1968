1. I just came from Fargo, and although I liked the movie from the Cohen brothers. I found the people and the town are nothing the way the show nor the movie portrays.

2. Most of the actors and actresses have poor Dakota accents on this show and there is little of the actual city portrayed, with nothing but ice and snow portrayed.

3. In all, a poor job of actually portraying life in Fargo.

Note to grashamm:It does not take place in Fargo, ND. It takes place in Minnesota, most of it in Bemidji, MN.
