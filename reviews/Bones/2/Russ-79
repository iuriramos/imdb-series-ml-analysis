It is a poor series that wants to hit male viewers over the head with a claim that women are superior, but that is essentially what this series portrays. It was written by women, for women and contains male characters with no male genitalia attached.

The two lead characters here are both women, intelligent women with degrees in anthropology, however you practically never see them touch a bone, or do any work other than talk incessantly about how good they are and how they are in control of their own destinies and their relationships with the men in their lives. This seems like a propaganda film for feminism. But isn't feminism passe. Haven't we been here before?

I for one found this line extremely tiresome and boring. I happen to love women, but not these and not the writing of this series. 

I happened to buy this on blu-ray to see if I liked the series but I'm selling it as fast as I bought it. After watching a few episodes, I've had enough.
