I am a huge fan of Kathy Reichs books and was really excited when I heard they were doing a show based on her work. 

But I was extremely disappointed when I first watched it. Emily Deschanel does not resemble the Temperance Brennan from the books at all. And where is Ryan? In the books, the dialogues between kind of serious Temperance and funny Ryan were just amazing. And none of that is seen on TV. 

It's a good show to watch if you're bored and nothing else is on and if you try to push back everything you know from the books. But don't expect to see what you have imagined while reading.
