Ladies and gentlemen, be sad, or be glad, we are in the disgusting forensic TV series-era !! Now count with me, and anathematize our luck :

"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "NCIS", "Crossing Jordan", "Da Vinci's Inquest", even "The Cosby Mysteries" !...Didn't we already have ENOUGH ?! 

Since the late 1990 till the late 2000s we've got almost the same sick series about the genius criminologist with a partner, or a team, who go to solve crimes by scrutiny the autopsy, and what a nauseating mission to do. So you will have for sure lots and lots of repellent scenes where we see clearly, accurately and awfully the most horrific shots in the history of TV.

OH GOD. Once we had the great days; the good cop (or detective)-era such as Columbo, Kojak, Magnum, and Simon & Simon. Or the good old Sci-Fi-era, like The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Knight Rider. And oh boy we've got also the hot & sexy-era such : Cover Up, The Love Boat, Baywatch, even a cheesy one as Thunder in Paradise.

All of those was unforgettable, original, had good, real good, thoughts, action, women... Till THE X FILES came. At that point, it was the beginning of the misfortune or to be exact : The Catastrophe!

Undoubtedly The X Files was one of the greatest, but there was a few slight disadvantages; we had agent Dana Scully (medical doctor and FBI agent) in every episode doing an autopsy. And of course her lap - as the series succeeded - became part of our living room. So the thirsty-for-money producers loved it with all the physical terror, and the exciting hunt for the truth. Therefore they tried to repeat it in another, not too far, classification : The Forensic !

But it became so ugly, full of deformation, and very cruddy just like BONES. Plus the unsexy present of Emily Deschanel, bleeder as David Boreanaz (he was much better in angel), and all of these corpses...To the extent that every time I watched it I found myself screaming AAAAHHHHHH !! What a terrible gross !!

Cancel it please. You've canceled before real good shows such as (The Lone Gunmen) or (A Man Called Hawk). Here it's a bad one. So please, little mercy and enough with the Bones-era, or we'll drop dead ourselves out of the nausea and the monotony !!
