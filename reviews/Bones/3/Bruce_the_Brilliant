I a essentially a reader who enjoys movies and TV, rather than the other way round, and to see the Temperance Brennan of the admirable thriller series by Kathy Reichs degraded to this asinine bimbette was a disappointment. Emily Deschanel is pretty enough but has none of the intellectual weight needed to carry the role. Little Emmy is only 30 for Christ's sake, she would have just left school and could in no way have qualified for the job she is portrayed doing.

The score is a jarring nightclub shade of bland and the script is banal. It was obviously put together by someone with no real clue what science is all about and who has presumably never read the books.

It's a shame; both Hart Hanson and Kathy Reichs can do much better.

I bet Kathy is pleased that her name isn't prominently featured in the credits.
