David Boreanaz, Did he even graduate from High School. FBI agents are college educated. There are so many times I've cringed at his dumb remarks. He is a bull in a china shop. The other members of the cast are OK. My favorite actor is the artist. However, going from artist to using the high tech equipment she is using is a little unreal too. She just started using it. There was no any explanation on how she became so efficient on this highly technical equipment. The lead actress is OK. Her character has been developing as she learns how to play with others. I hope they do not change her too much. I like the original analytical person.
