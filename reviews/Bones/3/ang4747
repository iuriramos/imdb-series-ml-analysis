The highly entertaining and energetic Angel star couldn't have picked a worse forensics show to make his return to television. Although a unique idea for television (an idea already covered in books by Iris Johansen), most of the characters are cardboard cutouts of many other trite characters throughout television and movies - Angela is in the front of my mind as I say that with her emotionless facial expressions no matter what the scene is. While Hodgins has some moments that are worth watching, the rest of the characters are left dull, with most lines delivered monotone. Boreanaz' character is by far the only good thing to emerge from this show - he definitely offsets Deschenal's boring performance. Even after writing off this show as a no-go, I saw the commercials for the voodoo episode and thought I'd give the show another chance as I was intrigued. I was mistaken, however, as I was left as equally disappointed after the other times I've suffered through the show.

One last thing that I wonder - am I the only person in the world who has ever noticed Deschenal's wardrobe? For someone who is allegedly so ignorant about popular and mainstream life (signified by her trademark statement, something to the effect of, "I don't know what that means"), Brennan sure does dress in style. Must be all those fashion mags she was reading while digging up bones in third world countries. Boreanaz is the only reason this show gets 3 stars. I have a feeling once American Idol is off the air, the number of Bones viewers will dramatically decrease Â– and rightfully so. Here's hoping that Boreanaz will quickly move on to a better project.
