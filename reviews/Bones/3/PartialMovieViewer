'Bones' started out so good, it was on its way to a classy and great show. Easily it would soon become one of my favorites. The cast was tight, the chemistry was excellent, the brilliance was everywhere and focused.

And then the nagging lectures started. Cam goes out and gets a new boyfriend. This guy is so full of himself - it is time for this guy to leave. His majesty's hubris is overwhelming and the self-aggrandizing pontifications are too tiring.

One redeeming value to this character is - he is not on the show every week - so I will just avoid the shows he is in.

And Cam's boyfriend is not the only PC addition that can tank the show...it keeps getting worse. Why watch anymore? Speaking about Cam, why is she so snarky now? She is not likable at all anymore. End the show.
