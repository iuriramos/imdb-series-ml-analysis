Unrealistice?, you might ask. Yeah, that's my impression as I see this department loaded with young, beautiful people (mostly) that are alway so in touch with their feelings, smart dressing, unfailingly witty, women so sharply dressed and made up (with hairstyles to match) that one can't help but wonder if this isn't a fashion show in disguise, and so wise beyond their years. I can't imagine a department that didn't have people who weren't physically unattractive, perhaps not sharp at times, and yes, sometimes at a loss for a witty comeback.

Yes, each episode start with a body discovered in gruesome detail, never a body that isn't in an advanced state of decomposition. I'd love to have the computers these people have with such advance zoom features that enable solving the case.

Don't get me wrong. I watch this show but such beautiful investigators on the scene as they toss their designer hair about. It's a bit much really. Good show at times but in my opinion tailored for people that enjoy predictable scripts showing beautiful people.
