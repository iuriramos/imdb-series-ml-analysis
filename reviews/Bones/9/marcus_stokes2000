*Bones SPOILERS* 

Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel) is a forensic anthropologist who, along with her team, formed by Angela Montenegro (Michaela Conlin), Jack Hodgins (T.J. Thyne) and Zach Addy (Eric Milligan), and the FBI Agent who collaborates with them, Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz), investigates on murder cases where the victim's body is usually beyond recognization, because only the bones are left.

And in the meanwhile, the woman learns also how to deal with people, having been wary of them ever since her parents disappeared in late 1991...

'Bones' is an intriguing new way to look at crime fighting, blending 'NCIS' (the 'character-driven' part), 'CSI' (the often gruesome shots of decaying corpses or bare bones) and 'Moonlighting' (the obvious sexual tension between the two leads), with an exciting, funny and sometimes quite moving (e.g. 'The soldier on the grave', 'The woman in the Limbo') results.

The actors also seem to fit their part like a glove, especially Deschanel, Boreanaz (obviously), Conlin and Thyne.

I just hope that FOX doesn't try to ruin this one like it did with 'X-Files'...

'Bones': 9/10.
