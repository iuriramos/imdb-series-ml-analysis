This show contains everything a good crime drama should. first of all the each episode has an interesting crime with a great story line with twists around every corner. it's the kind of show that keeps you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. It also has comedy which, to me, helps you to connect with the characters better. Each character brings their own uniqueness to the show bones, being the one who is completely clueless to the world of pop culture for instance, makes for a hilarious character when things like American idol are brought up. this an amazing show that should go on for a long run. for hopefully at least 6 seasons. so you should try to make time in your schedule for this knock out suspenseful, witty, and darn-right entertaining show!
