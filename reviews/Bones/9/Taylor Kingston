I love this show so much. It's so intelligent and unlike anything you've seen before. You've seen cop shows, you've seen crime shows, but you've never seen a show where the bones are the key to solving the mystery. With an array of crimes, pretty much all involving murder, but you can't be surprised, how can they solve crimes with bones if nobody's dead? There are many different main plots, going throughout the entire season. There's Gormagon, The Gravedigger, Pelant and many others. With gripping stories, love, loss and babies, Bones has everything you could ever want.

Overall, I give this show a 9 out of 10.
