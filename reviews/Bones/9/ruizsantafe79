I love bones, but I hate the new character Dr. Camille Saroyan. She doesn't fit in and there is no way that someone with her so-called experience would replace an archaeologist in that type of work environment.

She is also an older and meaner looking Rosario Dawson. 

What does everyone else think? 

Did the other guy get fired or did he get offered another job?

Anyone have any good websites about Bones to recommend? 

Has anyone read the books?

Why do you need 10 lines of text? This is ridiculous.
