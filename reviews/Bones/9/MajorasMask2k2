After the premature cancellation of the acclaimed Angel (from Joss Whedon), David Boreanaz quickly returned to the television scene with this brainy series. Has potential to be Fox's next big hit (after 24, American Idol, and now House). Great writing, cool characters, and humorous banter between Agent Booth (Boreanaz) and Bones (Emily Deschanel (sp?)). The show centers around an FBI agent who is paired with a DNA/Bones analyst in order to solve crimes in a faster, more efficient manner; he can get her into places she normally couldn't go, and she can see things that Agent Booth misses. Started off to mediocre ratings, but steam had steadily gathered, and if positioned correctly (just like House was put right behind American Idol and is now a ratings juggernaut), it could definitely be another great hit for Fox, which can take all the quality programming it can stand.
