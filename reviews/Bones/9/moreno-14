I really like Bones, because she reminds me Scully (The X-Files) and Starling (The Silence of the Lambs). Brilliant people with a very cool and discreet behavior. It is quite interesting to watch a show in which the main character is really creative about the choices she makes in life. Of course there is a lot of silly talk in the episodes. But the presence of Bones is good enough to make them watchable. And there is also a good chemistry between Bones and her partner, played by the actor who starred Angel. This partnership is another link, in my opinion, to the atmosphere of The X-Files, even though the male character ins this case is not so complex and attractive as Mulder.
