Here's the deal. Books good, but books not show. Show good, but show not books. Neither pretends to be the other. If it is too much strain on your brain to understand this,try not to partake of either.

The relationships among the recurring characters are enjoyable to observe, and tend to bring us close to Booth, Brennan, Montenegro, Hodgins, et al.. Dialogue is smart and witty without getting in the way of the action portions of the show. I don't put my intellect on a par with most of the characters', so I willingly suspend disbelief concerning some of the more esoteric procedures which take place. I enjoy the unraveling of the crimes committed and the triumph of justice on each show.

The characters consistently react in concert with what the series has revealed of them, resulting in humor when in context and seriousness when the situation calls for it. Keep an open mind, relax and enjoy your new friends at work, and you will be much the better for it. Remember, it is an entertainment show, not a forensic or archaeological documentary. Have fun!
