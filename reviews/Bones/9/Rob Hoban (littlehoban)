This show is very good, and a compelling watch. The chemistry between Booth and Brennan (Bones) is fantastic, and this is used in the same way that 'Moonlighting' did with Cybill Sheridan and Bruce Willis or that 'The X-Files' did with Mulder and Scully. I find that the team of 'Squints' is light relief from the serious content of the show. Angela's continuous flirting with every man that walks into the Jeffersonian provides a stark contrast to the social reject that Bones is presented as. and I have even heard that Hodgkins and Addy are called 'Bert and Ernie' on set...how true this is!Addy is much the same as Greg in CSI

However, I am currently studying Forensic Investigation at the top university for it in Britain,CCCU, and must warn people not to make career choices based on a TV series like this or CSI, as neither provide anything like what you study. CSI is the butt of many jokes in lectures due to its errors and glamorisation of the job of CSIs...please look at the real CSIs or SOCOs before, as many people dropped out because the course isn't as 'glam' as they thought it would be, but the course is interesting none the less!

Anyways i love bones...i own both DVDs so far and the complete guide too. Yes they are a far cry from Kathy Reichs' Tempe Brennan, but this show gives Tempe a new dynamic. give it a chance!!!
