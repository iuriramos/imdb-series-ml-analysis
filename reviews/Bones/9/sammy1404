By the title of the show, you may think the show is all about bones from the body. But it's just the nickname of the main character Bones. She gets called this from Booth at first because she works with bones and she kept telling him "Stop Calling me Bones" she late accepted the name. She is also the smartest person in the world but has some trouble with social aspect's. There was a scene where the Victims favorites band was The Cure, and Bones said "Oh what did she have" Meaning the cure like cancer, and she also doesn't know who Kelly Clarkson is. But she is a real nice person. Any ways I love the cast. I love Jack and Angela. As Jack gets called the bug guy because of his love of bugs. They start to date after he asks her out. Then they decide to get married, but as the are about to marry, the find out that she is already married. So they break up for a few seasons. And I hated these seasons because they weren't together. But they land in jail in one episode, and they realize that they still love each other and they get married in the Jail and then had a baby.

Its a show where all the story line are awesome
