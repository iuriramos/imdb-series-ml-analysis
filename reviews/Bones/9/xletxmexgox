The main reason I decided to write this is so people know what it's really about. I can tolerate the people who dislike it because they think the actors are bad, or the show is predictable, and clich√©d, etc. But for all these people going on about it being a conservative show? What world are you people living in? Yes, Seeley Booth comes across as a conservative; mainly because the man has values, and morals, such as 'be monogamous' 'stand up for what's right', and he believes whole-heartedly in Christianity and the church. Now personally, anyone who can't identify, or at least understand those values.. probably not someone worth listening to anyways. Brennan isn't liberal or conservative theoretically. If anything I would say she leans more towards liberal with her very loose moral system. She's just very un-PC, which in this era, is a god-send, and a delight to watch. But what I've come to notice is in the day to day small things with the show, it leans more towards being very liberal. Pre-marital sex, random hook ups, feminism galore, and the obvious derision of Booth's Christianity are just a few things that tilt it in that direction. But in the big things, yes it does tend to lean more towards conservative. And frankly, seeing as how we have probably over a million liberal/left- wing shows on the television... I think liberals would be more tolerant of one that sits on the fence. Now, all that being said, I enjoy the show. Brennan's straight forward honesty, non-political correctness, Booth's intense loyalty to his values... Yeah, the plot is pretty much just like every other crime show on TV. But I think Brennan and Booth make all the difference, just with their honesty, and stead-fastedness.
