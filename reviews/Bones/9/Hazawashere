People this is a TV SHOW made to entertain us as it is FICTION and not reality. If it were reality this show would freak people out a hell of a lot more than it does already for some people. 

Firstly BONES is a much better show than CSI and secondly Emily Deschanel is a great lead as she plays her role as Temperance Brennan very well. The 'squints' do not play with the body as many of you have said they are simply actors trying to make it as realistic as possible for a fiction based show. Bones unlike other crime shows is not just based on the criminal part of the show but is also about the characters and their lives as well as how they interact with one another and get along. 

One Question to people who hate/dislike this show: If you hate/dislike a show why do watch more than a single episode?
