I find myself enjoying this show more and more.

It successfully balances between stand-alone episodes and over-arcing stories (unlike so many others) and between science procedural and character drama.

It generally does a good job of fitting the science into a one-hour slot (it occasionally speeds-up timescales or stream-lines reality a little but I'm not going to quibble about that given the constraints of writing for TV).

The show's characters are complex - they develop and change as the series progresses, learning from each other and revealing previously hidden layers, but without stepping beyond what's believable. The "will they / won't they" attraction of opposites between the lead characters doesn't do it any harm at all and the whole show is very well acted by a great ensemble cast.

Consistently well scripted, 'Bones' doesn't duck controversial issues but also doesn't shove a single point of view in your face. It's nice to see a show that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence and can be appreciated at many different levels. Definitely one for "grown-ups of any age".

It's also striking that even at it's darkest it still continues to entertain with great humour and imagination.

Congratulations to all involved! Long may the balancing act continue.
