I absolutely love Bones. It is a fantastic show. It contains all the elements I look for in a show. Drama, mystery, humor, sexual tension and interesting characters!! And did I mention humor? I laugh so much sometimes that I have to rewind to see what I missed. I think Hart Hanson has another winner here. I will admit that the only reason I started watching Bones was to see David Boreanaz. And as usual he is doing an excellent job on this series. However, I have come to love all of the characters. And if you like looking at David Boreanaz you will also like looking at T.J. Thyne. He is more than just pretty eyes. And not only did casting do an excellent job with the weekly cast, but the guests stars have been phenomenal. If you like the show be sure and check out Kathy Reichs books also. There are different from the show, but they are so well written, interesting and funny also. I just love people with a good sense of humor!!
