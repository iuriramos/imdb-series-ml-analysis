I love this programme. It is entertaining and, in a way, educational. This film is about an anthropologist called Temperance Brennan (Bones), Seleey Booth (Agent), Zack - Brennan's assistance, later hired by Camelle for a proper Job and not an assistant, Jack Hodgins - Bug and slime guy, also falls in love with Angela. He is "nuts about Angela." Angela - She is Brennans friend and she likes Jack Hodgins. We find out in season two, in the episode of the 'aliens in the spacecraft' (Or something like that) we find out the Jack sends Angela love notes and that he admits that he loves her.

The audience can sense sexual tension between Bones and Booth and you can see the Booth 'likes' Bones even when he gets back with Camelle, his ex girlfriend.

^I am not going to say - write anymore, don't want to spoil anything.^
