I disagree with all those who say this programme was bad,I found it to be a breath of fresh air on the TV when it first came on to the UK screens and I've loved the series since it's beginning back in 2005.I hope that there will be another series as it left plot points behind for one in my opinion.

The layout of the story is like this:

program is a mystery/thriller, telling the story of a series of case files, solved weekly, by an unlikely alliance between Dr. Temperance Brennan's forensic anthropology team of the Jeffersonian Institute (a thinly veiled Smithsonian Institution), and the FBI.

Dr. Brennan's team brings scientific expertise (and an outsider perspective) to the world of criminal investigation, while Agent Seeley Booth brings human intuition, expertise, and "people skills" to the table. The result is an often strained relation (the two sides don't always understand one another), but the results are better than either side of the team could accomplish on their own.

Fans of the Brennan books have expressed their dismay that the character in the series only shares the name with the character in the books, and none of their life histories or characteristics match.

In an ironic reversal, the on-screen Temperance Brennan moonlights as an author, writing about the adventures of a fictional forensic anthropologist named Kathy Reichs.

I hope that I have been some use to you,and that having read this you'll go and watch the series.

It is an extremely good programme,that has to be watched at some point or another.
