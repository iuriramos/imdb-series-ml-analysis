I saw the first Bones episode while in America, and then had to painfully wait for the series to start in England! The characters are brilliant - Brennan and Booth have a great partnership which is constantly developing through the episodes. The situations they find themselves in really play on their chemistry and a lot of fans love the 'will they, won't they?' part of the show. Brennan and Booth have such clever and witty dialogue the whole way through. Even the rest of the 'Squint Squad' are all likable, funny characters.

The show has everything - intelligence, humour, action, excitement, great characters, wonderful actors and thrilling story lines. It's more than a just crime show! With every episode, a mystery is solved, yet there's also a longer running mystery about Brennan's family, which I think is a really clever storyline! 

I've found very few TV shows have left me grinning with excitement and wanting next week's episode so badly! I've read many people's opinions where they don't find Bones all that good based on the pilot. This is a show that continues to get better through the episodes, so don't let yourself be put off by the pilot episode.

Each episode has ever changing story lines and just when you think you know who the murder is, something is revealed that completely changes your mind! Something that I love about Bones is that for a show with such serious crimes and issues, it does have a lot of laughs and the humour is done in a very quick and clever way. It's a show that can combine funny quips and sarcasm with horrific murders, assaults, and issues such as drugs, politics and sexual assaults, all in a very real and intelligent way.

I am really hoping that Bones continues for many many more series as I couldn't bare not to have my fix of Booth and Brennan!
