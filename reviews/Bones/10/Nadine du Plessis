We(me and my husband) started to watch this series and did not know what to expect and soon we were hooked on it.

From the beginning I wanted Booth and Bones to try to hook up but it never happened, that is why I kept watching, but the down side of it was when they finally slept together it was because Bones was upset regarding Vincents death, there was no passion and then a couple of episodes on she was pregnant. I know there was an episode with Dr Sweets that they finally opened up, but I would've liked it for them to finally get together. We did not even see them being passionate. I love the series, but that is the part that I was a bit unhappy with. The whole series leads up to that and there was nothing to see in the end, She even told Angela, but we(the viewers) didn't even hear it.

I won't stop watching either, love the gory stuff, but suspends I can't handle, thats when I duck behind my husband.
