I won't lie. When I first heard about a new crime-like show appearing on Fox, the only reason I tuned in was for a glimpse of David Boreanaz. To my delight, I found that the show was much, much more than just a pretty face.

"Bones" casts a new twists on the "CSI"-like procedural shows peppering the major networks. Emily Deschanel plays Dr. Temperance Brennan, a forensic anthropologist at the Jeffersonian Institute in Washington, DC. Boreanaz is FBI Special Agent (and ex-Army Ranger) Seeley Booth. The duo work together to find out the cause of and the story behind the "corpse of the week".

They're aided by the "Squints" - a team of Jeffersonian-ites specializing in different fields. Jack Hodgins (TJ Thyne) digs bugs and dirt; Zach Addy (Eric Millegan)is Dr. Brennan's research assistant; and Angela Montenegro (Michaela Conlin) puts a face to the victim, as well as using a special 3-D imaging computer to help the team figure out how the victim died.

While the beginning of the show may have been a bit rough, the chemistry and in the inter-relationships really started to show in the actors and the characters they play. The audience is often left to wonder when, not if, Booth and Brennan will "hook up".

With the start of the second season, I can't wait to see what will happen next for this dynamic duo, especially with the addition of a new boss!
