This show is great! I give it a perfect 10. I enjoy the character interaction between the main characters played by Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz. It is also really funny! They are often in disagreement, but there is definitely some sexual tension also. The show looks into the personal lives of the characters, as well as the usual weekly plot line. This I find gives more depth to the show. Compared to other shows that are out there. All the actors portray their characters very well, and are enjoyable to watch. I highly recommend this show if you like forensics, comedy and potentially a little romance!
