OK, I will NOT give too much out, but, in my opinion, this show is great, with its interlinking shows, where 2 or more shows connect with one another, due to having the same bad guy to catch, or the same good guy, having to deal with the same issues, and in all reality, ever since I have started to watch this show, I have always dreamed of being in it, and consistently coming back to it, with hopes, that it keeps its genre going, so that people keep watching it, and giving it a good sign of going longer, and I know I would do my best, on either side, either the bad guy, or the good guy, preferably a good guy, though, as maybe one of the FBI agents, or something like that, and I know I can do it, if a child, can do the acting, then so can I, and I would love to be able to tell these actors/actresses in-person, how great they are doing with this show, and how they have kept it going, and as interesting(Especially with the inter-connecting episodes), as they have, as well.
