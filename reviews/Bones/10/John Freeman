In season one, episode 11 Zack tell Brennan the amount of electricity required to break the victim's teeth is 480 volts, 350 amps. This is impossible. 480 volts cannot push 350 amps through a human body. If 350 volts did go through a body the body would practically vaporize or at least explode.

A generator capable of producing this much electricity would weigh around 3 tons and possibly require a tractor/trailer unit to move.

A motor utilizing this much kind of juice would weigh about 2500 pounds.

While 480 volts is capable of producing spasms capable of breaking bones the amount of current is relatively small, perhaps 3 volts.

480 volts is used only in industrial settings. It is illegal to use such a high voltage in a residence. The woman could have been tortured in an industrial settings with no generator required.

480 volts, to get technical, is only available in 3-phase setups. She might have been tortured with just two phases which would produce 277 volts and give quite a jolt. I have been shocked with 277 volts and it was frightening but did not last long enough to hurt me. Most people who have experienced this voltage will be gun shy in the future.

Although sources disagree the consensus seems to be an electric chair utilizes 2000 volts and 5-7 volts.
