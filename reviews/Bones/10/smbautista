When this show came out I watched the pilot and the next two episodes. After watching these three episodes I was hooked on the show and started watching all episodes! Something about this show is very good. Also I like Temperance's competence and intelligence. This show and 24 are the two shows on TV that I have to watch each week. I'm very happy with this show, I should pick up the DVD's of the first season. I'm glad that a third season will be released. I look forward to more information about the show and the characters. I think the best episode of the series was when Bones and Hodgins were buried alive underground in the car. The drama was very good in that episode. I hope they keep this show on the air for more years. It reminds me of The X-Files. A male and female gov't agents working together to solve cases. Although this time there is no paranormal or gov't conspiracy cases, just homicide cases. I want to see a movie about the show sometime! Hooray for BONES!! :)
