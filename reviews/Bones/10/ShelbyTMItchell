This show is really good and that it is really going to grown Dr Temperance Brennan played wonderfully by Emily Deschenal is great as the doctor scientist who tries to study bones in order to find out how the person got murdered. David Boranaz, after years of playing the straight man in Angel, gets to play the comic relief in Agent Steely Booth who makes Brennan the rear of his jokes. But the two find each other annoying as well as attractive to each other. As he must tag along as a liaison to her and she to him. Wonderful witty acting as well as great writing makes the show a must see! It can hold its own from Prison Break!
