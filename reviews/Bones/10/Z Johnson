This show reminds me of Homicide, but with mostly forensic scientists instead of mostly cops. Like in Homicide, the crimes are important, yes, but there's always a (usually) satisfying subplot involving the character's relationships to one another, their lives, or their feelings towards their jobs. The characters are likable and believable, without becoming caricatures, and the writing is generally decent. There's dark humor in the show as well, but it doesn't overpower the dramatic center of it. The two main characters are Det. Seeley Booth and Dr. Temperance Brennan. While Brennan doesn't actually work for the FBI, she and her "squint squad" (why are they called this? they squint at things, according to Booth) help out the FBI when they come across someone's body, and need to find out how they died, where they died, and who they are. The squad contains Angela, Brennan's best friend (and polar opposite), an artist who reconstructs people's faces using their skulls. The other two members of the squad are Jack Hodgins, a conspiracy theorist who works mostly with insects and dirt, and Brennan's naive genius grad-student assistant, Zack. 

As previously stated, the show deals not just with the crimes that these characters solve, but with how they relate to and deal with one another on a regular basis. The descriptions I've written of the characters don't do them justice, because unlike many writers on television shows, the writers on 'Bones' take the time to develop all of them.

All in all, one of the better TV shows out there today, and definitely one of the best dramas.
