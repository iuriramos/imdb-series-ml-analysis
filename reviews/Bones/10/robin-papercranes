Bones is a great show. Sure, it seems like your average run-of-the-mill detective story of a TV show, but unlike the Jerry Bruckheimer CSI shows, Without A Trace, and Cold Case, the ties between characters is a lot more important to the plot of one show. Numb3rs had a hint of the character connection stuff, but Bones brings it to a whole new level. And while the technology seems a little far fetched, if you watch the special features on the Bones Season One DVD set, you find out it's not as far-fetched as it appears, as Kathy Reichs readily points out. Kathy Reichs, while being the person the show is based on, is actually one of the shows producers as well as being one of the few anthropologists certified by the country and an author. Everything dealing with Bones and what-not goes through her first, and everything dealing with the FBI goes through some one who actually works for the FBI so nothing is out of place.

So the show becomes something of a drama, yet still holds the classic crime scene atmosphere. Like Desperate Housewives, every episode is crucial. Yet like a classic crime scene show, they also have their own stories. While this show is a mutt of genres, it is still one of the best shows out there.
