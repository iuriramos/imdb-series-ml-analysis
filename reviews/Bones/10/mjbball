I remember seeing the very first previews for the show back in 2005. I saw them, (and had never watched Buffy or Angel) and I said that the show was going to be a good one. The day it aired, I started watching, and immediately, I was hooked. I have been ever since.

It's a great show for the family. There have been way too many time changes, but the fans have followed, and the audience is growing each week. I think the show is going strong, especially with this years season finale, which I won't spoil for those who don't want to know any of the spoilers.

If you don't watch already, watch! You will quickly become a fan!!!
