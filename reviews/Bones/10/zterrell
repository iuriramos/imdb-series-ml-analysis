This is a show about characters. The interaction here is by far and away some of the best on television...or available in theaters. The sexual tension between Bones and Booth is always near the surface, but never really acted upon. About the only downside is when they put one of them in bed with someone else. The mindless sex of Temperence(Bones) is explained as a physical need on an anthropological plane, but it reduces the respect you have for the character. Ditto for Booth when they overdo his dalliances. The real treat is when the team of squints and Booth work together to solve a crime. The interplay is wonderfully drawn, peppered with humor and makes each character come alive. I would hope the major networks take heed of the writing style of Bones and other worthwhile projects such as NCIS. We need more characters who are fun to watch in action.
