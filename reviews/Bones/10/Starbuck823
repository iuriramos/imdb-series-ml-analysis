First of all, give this show a few episodes. You need to get to know its characters, because they make the show.

I reckon Bones does the whole forensics better than CSI. I think its mainly because the characters work well together, where as CSI, the characters are a bit sterile and don't steer away from their given stereo type. Plus, CSI always seemed to have these random minute forensic details that can only be found by the lead man, and lo and behold, he solves the crime. In Bones, the forensic and the investigation parts are put together really well, and you feel like that everyone had a hand in actually solving the case.

The whole Booth/Bones relationship is done very well. When you put a male/female partnership, the dynamics can be tricky. I think they have got it right, with slow building their relationship through out the seasons. I'm glad they have been given the seasons to expand the relationships not only between Bones/Booth, but all the characters. The show also does good job of providing subtle humour without slapping you in the face with the obvious. Hard to do, but it is well done. 

All in all, this is a top show. Give it a go!
