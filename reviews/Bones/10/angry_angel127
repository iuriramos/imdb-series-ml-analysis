First of I'd like to say bones is awesome and waiting for the new season. my real reason is what is listed as an error or goof was misinterpreted. IMDb stated 

Continuity: "Season 1, Episode 19: The Man in the Morgue" Booth introduces Caroline to Bones in the New Orleans Police Station when she is arrested for murder. "Season 5, Episode 16: The Parts in the Sum of the Whole" They show Caroline, Angela, Booth and Brennan in Caroline's office while working on their "FIRST" case together.

If you watch the show you would know that bones doesn't remember anyone unless they are important to her. weather she cares about, hates or even uses them a lot. i.e. in season 2, episode 1: a fire rescue worker asked Dr. Brennen do you remember me. Her response was no as there are a lot of you and only one of me. a few line later Booth informs Bones that the firefighter's name was Nelson and it was at lease the 5th time you meet him. 

as for Caroline she is a mystery all her own. she stated at one point she doesn't remember lab rats names because they the always fail her in court, it the agents job to remember their names and what the did for the case. please get the goofs/ errors right.

if you want to catch a goof, heres some thing, if you watch bones and a show called How I Met your Mother. you'll notice a lot of the external shots are on the same set. the royal dinner made in an appearance twice once when Barney and Robin were breaking up, and during the big musical episode. start going over it, and see for your self.
