I find that Bones is one of the best shows around at the moment. At first i only started watching it because of my love for David Boreanaz, but since then i have grown to love all the main characters including Emily Deschanel, T J Thyne and Micheala Conlin. I believe that these four make the show what it is.It always has different but equally great story lines to it, and i have to say that i am never disappointed by it. Also most of the time in each episode there's always parts that make me laugh, and no matter what people say i will always think that Bones is a great show. I am so glad that it is back, great start to the 8th season! I cant wait to see how the rest of the season turns out, no doubt it will be great.
