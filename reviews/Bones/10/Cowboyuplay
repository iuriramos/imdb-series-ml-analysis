This must be the most underrated show on TV. It has a marvelous cast with David Boreanaz and Emily Deschenel as the leads. All the other characters are very interesting and well played also. It has improved every week since its pilot episode and story development has been wonderful. This show does not get the attention it deserves! Hart Hanson has done an outstanding job in developing and improving the writing. I love the snappy dialog and relationship between the characters. The partnership between Booth and Bones works so well. There is an underlying current between them that is electric. Altogether I believe it is the best show on TV.
