Without a doubt Bones is on of the best shows on television! I love the chemistry between the characters, and the story plots. At the end of every week they leave you with a clip from the next show which leaves you counting down the days until next Tuesday! I am so anxious about the next season and the romantic sparks between Bones and Booth!!! If you didn't see last season, you defiantly missed out! If you love crime, mystery, and a little bit of romantic sparks, this is defiantly something you would enjoy! There is not another show like it which makes it so mysterious and great! The closest shows to this would have to be CSI (THE Original) and Without a Trace. I give it a perfect 10!
