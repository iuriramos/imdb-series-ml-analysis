My wife and I love this programme and are feeling quite lost now that the series has ended. We really hope that the next series is well into production and will be on our screen soon. The characters are great and the story lines interesting if, occasionally, a little bizarre. The long running gag of Brennan's father keeps you wondering if the Feds will ever get him or if he'll be proved to be a good guy all along. Will Hodgins ever make Angela an honest woman? Who knows but its fun to watch! Will they ever catch the 'Gravedigger'or has he yet another part to play? All these questions need answers and I am a very impatient guy and desperately want to see how it all unfolds.
