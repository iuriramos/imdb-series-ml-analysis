I'm a big crime drama buff and this show has something a little different to offer than the run of the mill stuff we have been getting of late. I liked the hologram SFX and the sets and cinematography style shots gave the show a motion picture feel, the contrast between the inside and outside shots gave it depth and warmth you don't often get on TV. The sets were bright and big, a nice contrast to Angel's dark past. I do agree the dialogue was a little weak but I did laugh in all the right places and that's no bad thing. Crime shows can get so depressing I liked the lighter approach. It was more in keeping with the see saw of emotions we had on Buffy and I appreciated that. Temperance and Seeley had chemistry that simmered along nicely and I liked Angela too. It covered all the basics it needed to establish both characters and moved along well and left me looking forward to seeing more. From now on I'll always think of Anthropologists as "Squints", I like that one. Oh, and David Boreanaz is a fine actor and an asset to any show.

A beautifully shot and interesting look at anthropology's place in criminal investigations. Bones is a refreshing crime drama with a twist we haven't seen before, humour in the mix. It is a much more character driven show than most and one to watch.
