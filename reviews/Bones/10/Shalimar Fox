The first obvious appeal was the fact that Mr David Boreanaz was one of the lead characters, but upon watching the first episode I realised that the show is really cool on its own. Also, has one hell of a kick butt leading lady.

The splice of humour and seriousness is the right kind of mix for me, and the humour is nice and dry which is the best kind! The characters are evolving very well as you get to know them more and more each episode.

I've never missed an episode, I think Bones is a great show, great first season with lots of room to keep on going.
