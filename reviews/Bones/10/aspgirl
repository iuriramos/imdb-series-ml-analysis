I simply loved this show. the chemistry between the characters is amazing. it is wonderful how each of the characters have several layers to them not just what you see is what you get. each of the characters has their flaws but that is what makes the show seem real. the cases are interesting although gross at times. but hey you got expect that from a show named "Bones"right? the sexual tension between Booth and Brennan is so thick you can slice it with a knife.the friendships of the characters really make the show even more interesting. i have a feeling though that they are going to push for some romance between Booth and Brennan or Angela and Hodgins before the series is over with....hopefully both.but they don't put enough of some of the characters such as Dr.Goodman and Parker's mom, but i hear that in the second season they will be more of Parker's mom and another new character... cant wait.
