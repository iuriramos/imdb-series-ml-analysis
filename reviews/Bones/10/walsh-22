This is another show I didn't know about till I was flicking through the TV one day and saw it, I have been hooked ever since.

I really enjoy the partnership between Brennan(Emily Deschanel) and Booth (David Boreanaz), it is the funniest part of the show. Brennan has the academic smarts and Booth has the street smarts and there is always a debate in the show about which of their approaches work the best, in fact they both work and that is why the partnership is so brilliant. Another bone of contention is Booth's faith which Brennan doesn't understand as isn't visible and she, being a scientist needs to see it before she can believe.

I love the character of Temperance Brennan. The reason is she's not a perfect character, despite being very clever, she is always putting her foot in her mouth quite a lot, she comes across as a know-it-all that feels superior to people who are not academic, never in a nasty way but more matter of fact. She is also a very feisty heroine who doesn't need a man to take care of her, she has shown on more than one occasion she isn't scare to take on bullies, even taking on a gang leader in one of the episodes. She also isn't afraid to use a gun if the occasion calls for it.

Another partnership that has been hilarious to see is Dr. Hodgins (T.J. Thyne) and Zack Addy (Eric Millegan) who always likes to carry out experiments that always go wrong. They are like little kids when they get to test their theories. It is sad that Zack has left the show because I miss the interaction between them especially when they are competing with one another.
