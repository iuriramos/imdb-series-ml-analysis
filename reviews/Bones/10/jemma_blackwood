I've been watching this show from the very start and I think it is a great hour of entertainment. It may not have the critical success of crime shows like CSI but that's not what this show is about. It's all about the people and the relationships with the crime providing the storyline to base it all on.

David Boreanez makes a welcome return to the small screen. I was a huge Buffy and Angel fan. He is a great actor, funny and charming, but serious when the scene calls for it. Emily Deschanel is an interesting choice. She certainly pulls off the character of Temperance Brennan. The interaction between David and Emily's characters is great, fun to watch and gives hopeless romantics something to look forward to.

I hope this series continues into a third season and further. Who knows, it could be like the X-Files and Stargate and run for like 10 years.
