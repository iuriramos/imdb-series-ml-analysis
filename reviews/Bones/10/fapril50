I wasn't sure to begin with what I would think if this show. I have watched David B. in every thing he has ever been in that I can access. I fell in love with this show rather quickly after starting to watch it. Bones and Booth have a chemistry that just draws you in and makes you want to be their friends. In the episode the hero in the hold, You really see how much bones cares for booth, and you see how much it hurts her for Seeley to be trapped and her not know how to save him. I really hope the writers put Angela and Hodgins back together and I hope they figure out a way to bring Zack Addy back. Hodgins character seems wrong without him to play king of the lab with.
