Bones is my favoritiest show on TV! You have to love the chemistry between Bones and Booth! And you can't wait to see what they'll be up against next! The squints are such a family and it's wonderful to see them interact! You can't not love it! Every week is a new surprise! You can't believe some of the things Brennan will say or do. And it's funny because she's actually quite annoying. She's cocky and arrogant! She says things that will offend people! But it's everything so natural and so innocent (as in she doesn't do that to be mean) that you end up falling in love with her! And of course, Booth and his inferiority complex.. Can it be more hilarious! Zach and Hodgins the big geeks and Angela the heart of the team to balance it! And that's how a perfect show is made!
