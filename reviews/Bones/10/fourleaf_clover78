I'm not going to tell you that Bones is the best show ever; I won't even tell you that you're definitely going to love it; but I will tell you why you should.

Bones mixes fast paced crime drama, with romantic comedy, and still leaves enough explosions, bugs, and dead bodies for your boyfriend to like it too.

It's not just another crime drama, that leaves you guessing who killed the guy. Well yeah it has that; but there is also a more human element to it. It's not forced, it just is.

If any part of you likes a good mystery; if you enjoy being on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. If you find yourself trying to find the answers before the main characters do; you'll like this. Not only is there mystery among with the crimes, but even among the characters.

I suggest you watch an episode, and decide for yourself. I also suggest picking up a book by Kathy Reichs; they're very different from the show, but still VERY good.
