While browsing through netflix. I never once stopped at the t.v. show bones. So when I watched the pilot of the very first seasons, I have to admit it was rather interesting. As I continued to watch through the seasons. I grew fond of the characters. All the tension, chemistry, and friendship they have. It just builds with you and it make you feel as if your a part of the Bones Family. I would like to see Zack come back to the series just because rotating from intern to intern is okay but Zack had something they just don't possess. He was and always will be a part of the team. Keep up the good work I love this show now. And I'm glad I did stop and take the time to watch bones because in the end it grew on me.
