10 stars may be too much, but I really enjoyed this show immensely. Compared to things like CSI, Bones is orders of magnitude better - the forensic work makes sense, there are few holes in the script and, most of all, the characters are adorable (especially Angie :) ). The characters are definitely the best part - the main duo is somewhat predictable, because we know they cannot actually hook up as that would basically ruin the show, but they play their parts well. The rest of the pack - the squint squad - are really varied and fit together well - conspiracy fanatic Hodgins, "robot" Zack, sweet Angela and sarcastic Cam all contribute to the mix. I'm really sorry I've already seen all the episodes, I'm gonna miss these guys... Watch it, you won't be disappointed. Recommended.
