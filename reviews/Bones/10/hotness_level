They say opposites attract, and the relationship between Bones and Seeley Booth proves just that. There is obviously chemistry between these two. I like how they have a love-hate relationship that keeps them together in every episode. Emily Deschanel is a pretty decent actress, just like her sister. David Boreanaz is just a total beefcake. He's a pretty decent actor too. Anyone would be foolish enough to hate this show. One thing I like about this show is its ability to produce dark humor. Despite its intention to be a mysterious, crime-filled, dark background, it actually adds a little bit of humor to the whole thing. I like that there is a little bit of humor in the dialogue. Keep up the good work, Emily and David! Your fans are really counting on you guys to be successful and entertaining.
