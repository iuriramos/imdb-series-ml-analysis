Bones has to be one of the best written programs on TV this year, from the references to pop culture that Bones doesn't understand to the memorable in joke about Zach watching re-runs of firefly (in case you didn't know firefly was written by Joss Whedon the same man who masterminded "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel" which David Boreanaz aka Seeley Booth starred in.)It's not just a funny show though, it's fast paced action sequences and developing relationships between Bones and Booth and Angela and Jack make the show excellent entertainment. Everyone should watch this show once especially if, like me, you like CSI but think you know so little about the characters, Grissom, Sara and Nick in particular.

I would recommend this show even to people who don't like crime drama and it has nothing to do with an enduring crush on David Boreanaz... honest!
