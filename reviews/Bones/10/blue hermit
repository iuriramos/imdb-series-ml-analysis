Despite the inevitable comparisons with the CSI franchise I thought I couldn't do anything less than give Season 1 a straight 10. Bones carries torment, death and decay to new heights - or should that be depths? - and for me each episode has been genuinely interesting and absorbing to the extent that I placed an advance order for the DVD set.

Season 1 scripts were written with style and the casting of the principal players has been inspired. David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel are perfectly matched and clearly have no trouble with the personality traits of their characters. They can be thankful for three thoroughly competent supporting actors in Michaela Conlin, Eric Millegan and T J Thyne, who contribute a lot to making the scenarios of each episode so believable.

So far I've had the opportunity to see the first three episodes of the show's Season 2 and it is obvious to me that someone with influence in the script department has been incapable of leaving well alone. It's not surprising, such "bright" ideas have given the kiss of lingering decline to many a brilliant show.

A disturbing trend is clearly to be seen. Dr Brennan has been demoted by the arrival of a new hands-on team leader Dr Camille Saroyan (played by Tamara Taylor) whose presence disrupts the team dynamics in the laboratory to such an extent that I find it really irritating, not interesting as must be the intention. Tamara Taylor has been given a problem role here similar to the one Kim Delaney had in the first season of CSI Miami, i.e. a character that appears to have no contribution to make other than to get in the way.

I'll see how the next few episodes turn out but I have a feeling I may not be placing an advance order for Season 2.
