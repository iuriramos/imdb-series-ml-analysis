Bones is a TV show based on the life of Forensic Anthropologist and author Kathy Reichs. It is based around the Medicolegal lab in the Jeffersonian institute, Washington and with the help of the other forensic scientists, and her partner FBI Special agent Seeley booth, Dr Temperance Brennan sets about discovering the truth behind suspected homicide cases...

I have seen both the shows from series one and read the Tempe Brennan series books and they are like two different characters, in the book Dr Brennan is 40 something with a Daughter called Katy (who is in he twenties) and her partners name is Andrew Ryan, not Seeley booth, I personally don't think that they should have made reference to the show being based on the books, because there aren't all that many similarities! Apart from the fact that they are both forensic anthropologists! But despite this I still love the show, one of the best out at the mo, and I really can't wait for series 2!

(I recommend the Tempe Brennan series books by Kathy Reichs because even though the characters aren't all that much alike, if you like the TV series I guarantee you will love the books!)
