I would like to know when they will start showing the 2014 season on DirecTV? I have watched the entire series from pilot to the 2013 season about 5-6 times in a year already... I think I could recite all the scripts from all the episodes at this point. I Would love to continue watching, since this is my favorite show on television... Sit on the edge of my chair every week day hoping it will be showing the beginning of the new series. And, I sure hope they get rid of the Pelant character soon... Although the actor plays the role exceptionally well, and is a good actor, It would be nice to see him finally get caught. Love the brilliance that it shows the character to have! Amazing intelligence and abilities! Great plots, always! I can't help but to keep watching the show, even though I've seen all the episodes so many times. I find that I start going through withdrawals if I haven't seen it for more than a week or so. But am now just selecting the episodes that are more my very favorites. Best show on TV, in my opinion!! The casting of characters couldn't be more perfect! So please, if you have any pull with DirecTV, get their heads out of their....., and get them on the ball and start running the new series for us insane "Bones Junkies"!! Love you all! Thanks for the wonderful entertainment!
