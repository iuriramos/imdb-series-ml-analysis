I do not like shows about forensics. I only gave this show a chance because of the two leads - and I was instantly hooked. The stories have run the gamut from terrific to boring, but the ensemble cast has been terrific. The Christmas episode was a watershed event for giving a hoot about the fate of the characters and the show. The interplay of the characters, and the fact that they are all likable and positive, makes the show pleasurable even when the forensic aspect is displeasing. The Michaela Conlin character is a real charmer, and the actress is impossible not to watch. Any show with the Admiral from JAG gets a real boost.
