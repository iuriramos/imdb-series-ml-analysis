This show is amazing. I have never been so obsessed about a TV show. I can't wait for every new episode, and I get seriously angry if it is a repeat. It is about forensic anthropologist Dr. Temprance Brennan and her partner, FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth. We may have a lot of crime shows, but this one studies the bones specifically. It is amazing all the things they can learn from a set of bones. The main reason I keep watching is for the interaction between Bones and Booth, but the different cases draw me almost as much. I may be biased, but this show has good writing, acting, and directing. You can't make a decision about it until you have seen an episode, my favorites are Two Bodies in the Lab and The Girl with the Curl. I love this show.
