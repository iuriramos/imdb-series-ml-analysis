The best veterans days show i ever saw was the one they did in 2012 for veterans day.

Very well thought out and done Bones writers!!! Thank you for such a NICE honoring of our troops and 9/11 people! it was heart felt, considerate and respectful. It made us remember that day and all the people in it. Well written, well acted. I appreciated how Bones supported the team to be a good team. The characters were well developed, thought out all the dynamics as they probably would exist in this environment.
