If your looking for something different apart from shows like CSI and Law and Order which are both good, then look no further than Bones. It's fast moving, funny, exciting and has intriguing story lines which keep you gripped. There isn't many shows that are part thriller, part mystery, part comedy or even part action apart from like Buffy but Bones fits the category. Watch this for a change and you'll be surprised. The chemistry between the 2 mains, Booth and Brennen is brilliant and its them together which really makes the show work. The others in the group add to the brilliantness and all of them together make one hell of a good team.
