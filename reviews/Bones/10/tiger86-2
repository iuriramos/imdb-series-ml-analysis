I haven't read the books yet. I think I should say it from the beginning because most of the people who hate the show complain about the fact that it is not a good adaptation. Well... There always will be somebody not to like something great. No matter if it is a movie, a book or a TV-show. People who don't like something will always find their "logical" reasons not to like it. Even if it is great. Even if it is the best in its genre.

"Bones" really is the best in its genre. It is smart, funny, serious, wonderfully written and perfectly acted. There are actual characters and every single one of them is a real person. And, what is the most important, every single one of them is irreplaceable at his or her position. You won't see Dr. Brennan doing the job of Dr. Saroyan or Dr. Hodgins doing the job of Dr. Brennan. Everybody does exactly his job and doesn't interfere in other people's jobs. You can't even imagine how great is to see something like that after seeing detective Goren from "Law and Order" doing practically everything in his show except being a well developed character. Every single character here is a real person with a real position in the team. There are no unneeded characters.

As for the cases... They are just amazing. Seriously, what you will see is really interesting and the way they all solve the case is always worth watching. Really. I won't spoil anything, though.

Now let's talk about the books. From what I've read this show has nothing to do with the books except the name of the main character. You see, it is not based on the books. It does not try to be an adaptation so it can't fail at that. If you go with the proper expectations you will be satisfied.

I am sure.
