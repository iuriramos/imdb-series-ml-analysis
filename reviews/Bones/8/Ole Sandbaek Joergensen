I have followed this series for the past 10 seasons and it has been entertaining, thrilling and some times really gross to watch, there have been good and bad times, but after ten seasons it is the same type of story from episode to episode. They still have new murders and new life changing situations, very common stuff like the rest of us and very strange stuff like no other. David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel have been an interesting couple to follow both before and after they became a couple in the series and they have both evolved, so has all the people around them, so it might be a good time for the series to end.

There are plenty of good things to say about this series, they started of as a new twist to the CSI series, but in a more traditional partner up situation and they have really created some fascinating scenarios, some interesting characters and a lot of entertainment and fun a long the way.

They are not closing it all off and there are speculations for Dr. B to come back to the next season, but honestly I do not think there is more new different stories to tell, they have shown so much and have had a lot of fun, it is time to end the series, because I do not think it will work without the main couple and I do not think they can make it interesting again. It is sad, but ever since they killed of Sweets it hasn't been the same, the introduction of James Aubrey was really good, but I guess it is time for all the squints to move on and for the couples Angela & Jack, Camille & Arastoo to do what they need to do.
