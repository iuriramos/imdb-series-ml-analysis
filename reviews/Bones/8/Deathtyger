I have watched several police and crime type shows but when I first came across this show and discovered that there cases were based on not the living but bones of the dead from leftover crimes. I found this different, a new twist on crimes and solving them. I have now fallen in deep with the show and enjoy watching it greatly. The characters are both strong in the roles they all play and they still have that base of comical fun mixed in that keeps it amusing despite that they are what you would say "digging up the dead." I would have never thought that so much could be understood by the right tools and the study of bones but then again we do understand a great deal about the dinosaurs and they have been dead for centuries.
