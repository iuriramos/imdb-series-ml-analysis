OK so I'm English and to me this screams American, but I love it! I'm on Series 4 at the moment.

I love the Booth/Brenan combo, very effective with the two minds and they work really well together.

Booth....Booth is (hot) very American. Screams your stereotypical American cop (well technically he's an FBI agent but you know...). He's a pie eating, coffee drinking, patriarchal guy who says he's Catholic but he's really not. OK, the Catholic thing bothered me. He preaches about how good God is and how Brenan always insults his religion yet he sleeps around, swears and kills people (admittedly 'for his country' but the Catholic church most likely doesn't see it as a reason to kill. I also know he doesn't like killing but he still does it). Not very Catholic if you ask me. And I know because I do Religious Studies at college.

Brenan is an interesting character because she is incredibly clever and genuinely cares. I like her but I kind of wish she a tad more depth to her, she's getting there but maybe that come's in time later on in the seasons.

This TV show inspired me to consider Anthropology, especially forensic anthropology, in uni. I love it and am addicted to it... but it's so American :')
