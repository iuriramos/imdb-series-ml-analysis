2 goofs: If Booth was truly a sniper, his medal from the firing range would not be "sharp shooter" but "expert". The "sharp shooter" designation is better than mediocre but less than the best. In a first season episode he gave away his medal which had "sharp shooter" on it. Secondly in the first season the photos of Dr. Brennan's father don't show Ryan O'Neal who shows up later as her father.

Otherwise this series has captured my enthusiasm, not just for its crime solving and situations, which are a lot of fun, but for the affection and loyalty this team shows for each other, some more than others, and their empathy for the living victims and relatives they deal with. They show passion that is very believable, even the very rational Dr. Brennan.
