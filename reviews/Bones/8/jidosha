If you're looking for a fun filled crime solving show, then this is the show to watch. This is not your average crime investigation show. Bones lets you inside to what happens during forensics and criminal investigation, but also introduces you to the lives of the crew behind it. 

The characters all have different personalities. They all struggle to work in the same space to solve crimes and still be able to make it fun to watch. The chemistry between these characters open up you interest and you enjoy following them. Despite the seriousness that goes about their work, it still delivers you a laugh at every corner. Gives credit to good writing, acting and directing. Of course at times it also touches your sentiment by adding some intense drama between the crime story lines and also drama within the characters themselves.

Majority of the characters are intelligent scientists so it is common to hear science terms and jargon that may confuse the average viewer at times. They do however tend to give effort in to explaining them enjoyably through witty writing and character delivery.

I've been a fan of the show since its conception and I have to say it's been a fun journey. It's one of my favorite shows and I am happy where it has gone. I have to admit it has its weak moments. Some crimes grow nonchalant and predictable. The character developments also grow to a dead end at times. I am also bittersweet about how they write off characters and bring new ones in to keep the show interesting and set a different vibe. For a show running this long it's understandable they could tend to decline in writing.
