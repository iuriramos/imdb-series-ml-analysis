Five seasons in and still going -- if not strong, at least still going. Brennan and Booth have gotten perhaps a little too close in more recent episodes, and they even performed the beast with th two backs at the close of last season in a dream sequence. But they are still a great team. For those unfamiliar with the show, Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who along with FBI special agent Seeley Booth looks into unusual murders nationwide. Brennan is part of a very quirky team back at the Smithsonian -- oops, I meant to say the Jeffersonian -- that includes a bug and soil specialist who is also a not-so-secret multimillionaire, a facial reconstructionist who advises Brennan on things romantic, and a fairly normal boss who is a doctor and a former lover of Booth's. Various colorful interns come and go with regularity. BONES has been a terrific show most of the way, although perhaps five seasons will prove enough. The gimmickry of the show has started to wear thin. The worst thing that could happen is that it turns into a soap opera, which is what HOUSE has become and ER before it.
