In my opinion this show is going from strength to strength. At first this show was slow moving, not the greatest plots and the acting was raw. However as the characters have been introduced and established this show has proved to be a future hit. 

The long term story line has you guessing countless theories as too the whole Brennan's history and her dads story, each episodes themselves are improving with the randomness and at the same time continuity. 

The development of character relationships maybe coming together a little soon for my taste but at a pace which will keep viewers tuned in to see what happens

All in all a good show, make sure you give this a few episodes and learn about the show before making judgement. My hope is this show is giving its time to grow and become what it can be before the network pulls it for more garbage

Final judgement - check this show out its worth the time
