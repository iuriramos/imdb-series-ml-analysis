In the context of the latest forensics hype in TV-land, (see CSI and its numerous spinoffs) 'Bones' is nothing innovative. Emily Deschanel's Temperance 'Bones' Brennan is the cynical, if not clinically objective, forensic anthropologist with social issues whilst Seely Booth (played by David Boreanez), a former CIA sniper, is her cocky, and far more human, counterpart. Throw in some yet-to-be-resolved sexual tension that's bubbling at boiling point and some pleasantly quirky secondary characters and you have a seemingly formulaic but charmingly earnest show.

Despite the continual sense of deja-vu that reappears again and again throughout each episode, there's enough to make it seem original. The cases are interesting, the science compelling and the chemistry between Deschanel and Boreanez keep a fine balance between the professional and personal elements of the show.

This isn't breaking the genre mold anytime soon but for the strong-stomached viewers with an obsession for corpses, maggots and everything in between, 'Bones' is sure to satisfy their grisly appetites.
