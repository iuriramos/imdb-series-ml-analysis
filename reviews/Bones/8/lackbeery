I love the TV Show Bones--But what happened to "Sweets"? I don't care for this new guy at all....Couldn't Sweets have a cousin or something that comes into the picture.....There's just something missing off the show although I do still love the plots and the other actors.....there's a big empty space on the show....kind of like Chester to Sheriff Matt Dillon (if you're in my age group) (64) You have to have ten lines for a review. That's a bit silly. I love Bones--Her TV Husband is cool, the writing is wonderful, the other actors can't be beat.....they all add to the great show that this is...I hope it continues on for years.....but I wish you'd bring Sweets back.....His dead pan style of humor/acting added to the plots.
