Sick of sitcoms I went looking for intelligent television and found it in Bones. Yeah, some of the science is unrealistic and happens at light speed comparative to real life forensic analysis, but it's science -- and it's sexy. The characters are quirky and not canned, they compliment each other well and there's plenty of friction. I'll keep watching cause it's interesting and not badly written. Booth and Brennan keep us watching to see what she'll let him get away with because we all know she like him more than she lets on.

I wish actual crime labs, forensics and morgues had these beautiful labs and stunning people that show up in television, then this dumb cop would be surrounded by hot people in amazing clothes, but until then there's television :)
