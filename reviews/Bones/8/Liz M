This show just keeps getting better! The writing is admittedly quite painful at times, but the character development, especially for a "procedural" show, is excellent. The chemistry between Booth and Brennan is a joy to watch, and the comedy is well done. The plots my be a bit over the top, but is Bones is a show that does not take itself entirely seriously, so it can be forgiven. The acting is very good, from all the cast. Standout episodes include "Two Bodies in the Lab" "The Woman in Limbo", "The Woman in the Sand", "Two Aliens in a Spaceship", and "Judas on the Pole". I look forward to see what's going to happen to the characters.
