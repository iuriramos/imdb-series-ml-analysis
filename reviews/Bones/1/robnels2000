This show is typical of all the current crime dramas on TV today, dull and predictable. Predictable because the stories are reused from all the crime dramas that came before it.

This show is so predictable you can tell what's going to happen in the first 3 minutes. I was so disappointed by the first show that I stopped watching it for a long time then I caught an episode part way through. In that episode an Arab American was killed when a bomb blew up his SUV and he was thought to be a mad bomber terrorist. I walked in while the main characters where asking the wife questions and a man was pacing nervously behind her in the back ground, it took me 3 seconds to predict the husband was murdered by his wife's lover and frame the dead man as a terrorist. 10 minutes later that was exactly the story.

I wonder how much they paid the critics to like this crap.
