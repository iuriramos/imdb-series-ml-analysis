This show was once upon a time a good drama, but now it is nothing but,a family show.It was a crime drama at first now it is all about marriage and babies.What happened to the crime part of this show.I guess went the way of wedding bells and storks.I can't watch this show anyway because,cable and the digital transition stoled channel 28, from us.But I would not watch it anymore even if we did have 28. I have nothing against marriage or babies it just that a crime show is not meant to be a family show. That is my mom opinion on the show, mine is I have to agree ! It was meant to be a forensic crime drama, with comic undertones. Not a family show where everyone gets married and has a baby, I mean not against the marriage and baby scene. But it needs to be toned down a lot , because it doesn't make good TV! There has to be a balance, somewhere. If one couple had a baby that is one thing but everyone. Instead of calling it Bones you might as well title it Babyboom the series.
