I wish there was a zero rating.

From Temperance becoming even more mechanical and ignorant of the most basic human interactions, to the ridiculous plot about a super hacker that can hear and see anybody, anywhere - even if the device isn't connected to a computer! - this show has become unwatchable. It's well past science fiction... would be better if they just ditched any pretense of reality, and had her chasing a super villain with super powers.. oh, wait they have.

No, people aren't eager to turn on the a/c when it is full of dead body parts. No, hackers can't see and hear everything, everywhere, 24 hours a day. No, hackers don't have an advanced AI at their control. And on and on....
