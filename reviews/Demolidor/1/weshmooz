The unrealistic plot lines are near maddening. I can suspend disbelieve long enough to accept a blind man beating up countless bad guys but the story writing and amateur acting skills of the main characters is unforgivable.

Seeing the overall rating of 9.0 for this show clearly personifies the how our society is so rapidly circling the proverbial drain. I'm saddened by the mobs of simpletons that make up this once great Country.

How do some of these morons get some shows so right and so many shows so wrong. It's akin to monkeys throwing their feces at a ratings chart.
