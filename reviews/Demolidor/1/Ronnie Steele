I imagine this 9.2 rating will drop considerably in time. Do to how much of an effort it is to stay interested throughout each episode. There is too much pointless dull dialogue between action scenes. I literally play on my phone for about 20 minutes at a time while sort of paying attention to this show and I still haven't fallen behind. 

About the budget. Most of this show is filmed in small rooms with few actors. It's true, offices, bedrooms,interrogation rooms, bars, confession boxes. You name it if it's small and can't fit a lot of people they will film in it. So yeah this show feels claustrophobic. Plus if there is an outside scene it's short and boring. Oh and dark. This show loves to bore you with dark small rooms with 2 or 3 actors and their tiring dialogue. 

Now the action there isn't enough of it. One action scene at the beginning one at the end and 50 minutes of boredom in the middle to have you asking yourself why are you still watching.

Even the music is boring.

Why is this good.
