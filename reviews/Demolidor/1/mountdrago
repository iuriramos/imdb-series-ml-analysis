The first season was tolerable with some improvements as it went along. The 2nd season, however, has deteriorated with dialog and plot lines obviously inspired by Aaron Spelling. Completely unwatchable. For example, the law firm's receptionist, conducts one on one interviews with clients on trial for murder, she picks the lock and enters someone'e home and she butts in an discusses cases with the District Attorney directly. Further, Matt (as his attorney self) puts his client on the stand to testify on his own behalf in a murder trial and when the client is reluctant to answer some questions, Matt asks the Judge to "treat him as a hostile witness." Not likely to say the least. But moreover, when the Judge inexplicably grants this inane request, Matt then turns to to the jury and delivers monologue on the need for heroes in this town - without asking even one more question. He then proclaims that he is finished with the witness and sits down basking in congratulations all around on such a fine job. 

When a show's own internal logic becomes so childish, immature and unbelievable that is disrupts the viewer's ability to buy into the created world, the show fails. And this one fails miserably.
