I never liked netflix creation in the past, but this one is one of the worst.

this show isn't cataloged as science fiction, but this is one of the most ridiculous science fiction I have ever saw.

a blinded man the fight like Bruce Lee, jump out of windows like spider man, move like batman,has ears of superman and and can kill room full of armed man(guns,m16) using his bare hands.he can also see a inanimate objects(like a fence) with is hears only.

I mean I liked watching batman,spider man,superman... , simply because you believe for 90 minutes that there is a man that can fly like spider or like bird, that is the concept of scfi. In this show you just get the filling that something is missing credibility, you simply don't "dragged" into it. 

Another thing that disturbing is the extreme violent, this show tries to get some points by showing awful violent scenes,like: behead man head with a door car, or creating knifes from human ribs or smash head with bowling Ball...

I definitely recommend to skip this one.
