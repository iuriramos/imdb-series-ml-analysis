This series is not worth anything.. It's not progressing at all.. This all episodes are just like a pilot episode for further installations. All released on April 10th, on one day..so you will wait for other stuff by buying this on netflix. I underline buying.. Just go watch Daredevil movie version of director's cut. Otherwise you will be unsatisfied with this series. As I said before, no progressing at any episode..Just leading the audience to another installation, like A.K.A Jessica...or Defenders..If it wouldn't, this should be aired on TV every week. Do not waste your time or your money. Mark Steven Johnson made a good work on the real version of the movie. Go and watch it, again, do not waste money on this.
