I liked the comics and the Ben Affleck movie, they had some violence as any other superheroes fiction, and I started to see the fist episodes but I couldn't handle it because its violence, there are horrible goring scenes, too much for me. This kind of explicit brutality has never been seen in a Marvel based movie. The director should have omitted these long and awful sequences because they doesn't add nothing to the plot. They have tried to make the people really hate the bad guys of the movie to justify the evil tortures that the "superheroe" makes to them. I definitely don't like these gore trend. There are much better ways of storytelling than this.
