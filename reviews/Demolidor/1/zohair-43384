Matt: Underacted, boring, monotonous, not at all relatable or enjoyable. 

Fisk: Fine, until Vanessa got poisoned and he became an overgrown 8 year old with anger issues and too many tantrums. 

Foggy: Campy and creepy

Karen: She was OK, not eventful but fun to watch

Wesley: Great character, beautifully done. Would watch a show with him. Shame he died.

Ben: Motivated, interesting to watch. Careful. Shame he died.

Plot: Predictable, boring, linear, no twists.

Fight scenes: Great, but less spin kicks. Nobu fight was a fancy kick contest and Matt getting cut like the vegetable he is. Matt won because PIS.

Finale: Predictable, horrible, threw away almost all character development for Fisk. Ended on a whimper.

Dialogue: Slow, boring, uneventful. 

How people say this is brilliant is beyond me, dark and gritty was done right but this show is so inconsistent I rooted for the Russians. Shame Fisk blew them up.
