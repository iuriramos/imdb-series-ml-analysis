When I was slightly younger, I had many of the publications of DC and Marvel, but this awful TV series does not manage to capture ANY aspect of what I fondly remember as a mysterious and almost magical alternate reality.

I have unfortunately watched a few episodes of this, and there is so much wrong with Daredevil it is hard to be constructive. The plots are vague, the violence is too much, the 'fights' almost identical in each episode, silly (and over-prolonged/time-wasting) male-female 'interactions', I could go on and on.

Foggy's character/script are clich√©d, and really, why is he there? The mumbling (low voice/high voice) dialogue of Fisk, (and some other characters) does not make Daredevil dark and moody, just insulting to watch.

Do the 'creators' of Daredevil only have teenagers in mind when making this garbage? Note that all the good reviews are from the teenage demographic, (probably), and appear to have no taste or the tiniest idea of how TV programs should be made.

Who are the scriptwriters? Where were they educated? Why are they so lazy and uncreative? Will they ever get a proper job? Truly an insulting attempt at entertainment. I wish I had never seen it. Sorry for the negativity, I guess I just feel dismayed when being treated like a moron.
