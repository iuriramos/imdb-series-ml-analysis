I love season one for its well polished and insightful script, outstanding and in depth character development of Wilson Fisk among with almost all the other characters such as the emotional, tough Russian brothers, shrewd businessman Leland, mysterious Chinese old lady Gao, trustworthy reporter Ben Urich. Scenes are also well cast with little redundant. Need to mention, I really appreciate the subtlety in the acting of Matt and Nelson.

However, when I just started to watch the second season, it feels wrong. I persuaded myself it will get better because the first season is just so amazing! With the strong acting of The Punisher, the season two barely make it trough by its first four episodes. It just crash hard onto the ground after this. The appearance of Electra flush every and all good elaborate foreshadowing into a stupid toilet sewer. Old man stick, Nobu, the past story of Murdock all fell into a shitty, low level popcorn movie. 

As for now, I don't think anything can bring back the third season to a worthy show, because plot wise, they have already dug a enormous hole that only can be fill with garbage in the third season. That why I give the awful rating. Thank you all very much for the season two imbecile developers and greedy Hollywood big shots. Congratulations to you all for successfully trashed a masterpiece.
