Like some of the comments posted I was very excited about Daredevil when it came out, but really, does it need to be THAT violent? It verges on psychopathic. The characters are great, and the plots have so much potential, but take out the violence and the show is half the original length. My kids love super heroes, I just wish that there were good characters, good stories and plots without the mindless, gratuitous violence that is getting so prevalent. The cinematography and style of the show is top notch. The acting is great. It is not over the top, unlike some of the fight scenes. The first big fight scene has Daredevil throw a flashlight at a container door which ricochets off its surface to hit one of the bad guys! He didn't know if the door angle was right. Purleese! But the characters are strong and well played. Please can the makers of these shows play down the violence and play up the plot some more. Give us something worthwhile and not just scenes stolen from Fightclub!
