Season one of this series was pretty good,season 2,well they made it a complete garbage.I am a big comic book fan but this series is nothing compared to the comics version of Daredevil.

Getting 8.8 ratings for this series is really absurd since season 2 completely ruined the whole series.Episodes of season 2 were pretty boring as well,as they were 50 minutes long,felt like really hard work watching the complete episode. I've heard how people say how awesome this show is (especially season 2),but those people are just Marvel fanboys, I don't know how this series kept it's rating of 8.8 after that awful season 2,but I can assure you it doesn't deserve good ratings.
