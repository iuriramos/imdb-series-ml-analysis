I wanted to watch this show after a lot of hype from media and friends. I began the show a few weeks ago. The pilot was very mediocre but I still wanted to give the show a chance. I finished the first season and decided to not continue it because the show only manages to get worse. Just like every other superhero show/movie Daredevil has the clich√©d plot of some vigilante saving the world from a bad guy. The villain of the show 'Wilson Fisk' is such a stale character and has very poor dialogues. The plot is so bad and the acting is only worse. Anyone who is above the age of 11 are incapable of enjoying this utter drivel, if they do they really have a poor taste and I feel sorry for them. Netflix should really stop making shows like these.

Stay away from this show and all other superhero stuff as far as possible.
