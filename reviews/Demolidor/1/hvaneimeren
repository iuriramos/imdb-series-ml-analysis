I have seen all the episodes in hope,that it would be getting better. Nothing is good on this show. It's too long with everything. Fighting, talking en crying. You hope its a lot of fun with an other superhero of Marvel, but all the Marvel shows have heroes, whom are crying all the time. Maybe it's to show how human the characters are, but it's not the way it should be. Make them man again and not a couple of crybaby's. All in all an other waste of time and money. According to the rules of this site I have to wright more about this terrible show. So some other remarks. I just wanted to be entertained. That's the whole target of making movies or TV shows. I know a lot of people like this show. I think, they can make the same show in 25 minutes and make it more attractive for everybody. No more long dialog s or fights.
