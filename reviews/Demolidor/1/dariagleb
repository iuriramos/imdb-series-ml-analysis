Nothing to watch here. A young boy is involved in an accident, gets super powers and beats up bad people. 

The story is filled is clich√©s, the writing is terrible, there is no storyline or anything. People appear at I am not even sure why some of the characters exist. The only thing that interested me was that while all super heroes wear their mask in such a way that their eyes are exposed, daredevil wears his mask the other way around, exposing his chin but that novelty wears off quite quickly and then there is nothing else of interest in the series. 

The people rating it highly are either fake accounts or daredevil fans. This series is made for a 12 year old although the violence is not age appropriate. If adults are actually viewing this series and liking this, I despair at mankind. No wonder the top 1% are getting richer!
