This is my second summary, the first one was blocked for no reason at all.

Season One 2015: of Daredevil was great 8 out of 10. Season Two 2016: Garbage. This series was totally ruined by the producers by adding a "daredevil woman" on episode 5 to 13. Ruined.

Now, we all know when Charlie Cox is in trouble, his new girlfriend that jumps and hops around like a grasshopper will rescue him. No thank you. Garbage. We won't watch anymore episodes.

I personally do not know if this review (summary) will be uploaded because it seems this IMDb site is now judging what you write. It warned me that I was 'shouting' - sorry sirs, I do not shout. Go to Russia...
