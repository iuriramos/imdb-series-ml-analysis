I love the Marvel universe and the artistic vision that has been expressed in comics, movies, etc. I especially enjoy it when well written and executed stories find their way to the screen without being mired in excessive profanity and sexuality. To me, this shows either a lack of intelligent originality or perhaps a deliberate attempt by the Hollywood crowd to desensitize the audience.

In my opinion, no Marvel story should ever warrant a MA rating. Dynamic action, anger and sensuality can all be tastefully expressed. Yes, it takes a bit more thought and creativity during the writing stage, but the results are more than worth it.

So, one star for not providing a great and imaginative story that responsible parents feel they can share with the whole family.
