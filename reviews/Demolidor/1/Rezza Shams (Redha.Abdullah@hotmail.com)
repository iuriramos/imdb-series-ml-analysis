I am a big fan of comics bieng marvel or DC, and this years the comic fans are blessed with movies and series that blows our minds. I say here that marvel outstanding job in box office deserve appreciation but in TV series they still have much yo learn!, actually I watched daredevil the movie " Ben afflic" although it wasn't a success it was way much better than this awful series , marvel rised the bar in movies and dc rised it in series. Daredevil, bad acting , bad script, bowring, wast of time, very very bad acting again, and remember marvel we always love to know the origins of our heroes and there always be a valid reason why they should be our protectors or instead of bieng a hero they will be no much than a villain.
