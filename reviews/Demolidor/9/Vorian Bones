Well, have you seen Kung Fury?

-If yes, you 'll know what i mean... Daredevil, it's like a film from the '80s which it reincarnate into a 2015 TV-Series. It has all the clich√©s it needs to have! And that's as cool & smooth as it can get! The Only thing missing from the series is a touch of Victoria's Secret Supermodels... Mad Max tried it and look at the result! Then and only then, Daredevil will worth its weight in gold, or a 10/10, for us to be pragmatic.

-If no, give Kung Fury a go and then watch Daredevil closely...

Daredevil brought me back to my child-age and i thank it for just that!
