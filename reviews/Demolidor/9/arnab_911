After realizing ‪daredevil2003‬ movie was a total and complete failure ‪marvel‬ decided to make a series ‪daredevil2015‬ and its packing some major behind kicking :D ! Although I was kinda dumb-founded by the epic beating, and the wounds Mat Murdoch got in some of the episodes. Its not that he was already wearing some kinda body-armor from the beginning & yes meditation does heal your body fast but only when you reach Nirvana, but by the looks of it- he was focusing all his anger and frustration on his healing; moreover he wasn't holding his pressure points at the tip of his finger which Edward Norton did at the end of Hulk 2, that's not how its done! Guess that's the glitch with the research team. That being said every actor nailed their part real smoothly and its the only series featuring a superhero which is giving stiff competition to ‪Gotham‬. BTW ‪shield‬, ‪arrow‬ and ‪flash‬ blew it when it comes to Gotham and ‪daredevil‬! An absolute white wash!
