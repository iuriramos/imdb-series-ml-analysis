This is best dark piece of TV I've seen in quite a while. To keep it short:

Imagine Chris Nolan developed a Marvel flick for television and Drew Goddard adorned it with his sweet and nasty nerdism. 

You'll get perfect character development - this goes for the vigilante (Charlie Cox is brilliant as Daredevil as well as the blind lawyer) as well as for his opponent (D'Onofrio is outstanding and maybe one of the most well conceived comic villains ever !!!) - and a thrilling superhero origin story.

Daredevil would've made the best Marvel movie so far, if this was thought for the big screen.
