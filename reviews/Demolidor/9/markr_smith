OK. so i've just watched the first two episodes. I was wondering how this show would match up against other 'superhero' shows and what it would bring to the table to make it different... and now I think I've seen it. 

The camera work, cinematography and choreography in the corridor fight scene at the end of episode two was fantastic. Every detail of the scene was spot on, well shot, and so well organized that I can see this show being successful purely based on artistic merit. Whether or not the story holds up, if the show continues to impress with action scenes like this then I can see it having a decent run. For me, this kind of scene would do no harm in a Hollywood Blockbuster like James Bond where they are going for more of a gritty 'realistic' fight scene.

Bravo, I really have to take my hat off to that scene.
