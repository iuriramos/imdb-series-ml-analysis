After a long while the comic character has brought to justice. Seriously. I loved the series as much as I hated the movie. Each and every episode is worth watching and since the characters are strategically placed and revealed throughout the series at their perfect timing.

Story, plots, screenplay, characterization, execution is should I say marvelous. Yes there is however some things could be improved IMO. And one of those are acts. No complains about the central character (Charlie Cox/Matt Murdock aka Daredevil). Finally someone who can top Ben ASSfleck. Well anyone can top him while it comes to act if you ask me. Deborah Ann Woll plays beautifully as Karen Page but she always seemed a little to obvious while delivering dialogs and also I found her a bit too sloppy when it comes to show emotions. Elden Hensonon the other hand is a perfect fit for the character Foggy Nelson.

The most irritating of all is the Wilson Fisk character played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Except for his appearance on the screen and a great voice this dude lack talent when it comes to act-the-sh*t-out-of-a-villain. I mean the great kingpin shouldn't be like that, he might has what it takes but HE CAN'T ACT. PERIOD. Every time he opens his mouth to say something cool in his husky voice it turns out to be a trash at the end of the delivery. I don't know if I'm the only one but I would rather choose someone who can actually act to play the KING. After all it's the ALL-POWERFUL-SUPERHERO-DEFEATING-VILLAIN character I'm talking about.

Other than that, I loved it, totally and wholeheartedly. 

My rating:9/10 

I would have given it a 10 if not for the Kingpin.
