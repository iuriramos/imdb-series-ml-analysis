Just finished watching Marvel's Daredevilâ€‹ n i have to say that!! this is one of the most awesome comic television adaptation after the joke of Dc arrow and Flash.( pssh. i am DC fan boy, grew up with justice league and batman animated series)

A darker approach to the comic universe!! stunts, acting, casting all at the highest point!! Daredevil (mathew) is an awesome actor with skills of acting of top notch! he plays the character so well!! His craft as a blind person is too awesome and he doesn't loose focus at the uneven period's of the episodes.(the glasses helped him as-well) Where as, KIngpin played by Vincent d'onofrio is at a scary level, his depth in portrayal of the king of hell kitchen has detailed touch to it , the body movement, facial expression all are at a very high level.

Their younger forms which is attached to the origins of both main actors have played exceptional part as well. The casting has been at the top level as both seemed to have the charisma of acting at their disposal and didn't made it feel awkward when the real form came at the peak of the episodes.

The fight scene are performed at a mainstream movie level, it might get an approval from the master of different craft batman himself. Both kingpin and daredevil have done their homework and presented a realistic art of fighting and violence.

At the end of the first season, the birth of an inch experienced daredevil is shown and a birth of a new and better version of daredevil is set to take on nemesis like Bulls-eye. All i can say at the moment is bring it on, the couch is ready and the popcorn as about to get all the justice it deserves.
