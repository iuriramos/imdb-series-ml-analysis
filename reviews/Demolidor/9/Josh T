To be honest, I didn't really know what to expect with Daredevil. It seemed interesting, but I was really hoping it would be good. And thank goodness it is. Very good actually. The acting is very good, the writing is good, the action is very good, basically everything about it is good, especially the villain, Wilson Fisk. He was one of my favorite aspects of the show. it's one of those where you actually understand why the villain is doing what he's doing. Fisk's plan is to ultimately clean out Hell's Kitchen of all of the pain, suffering, and agony, but he must give out pain, suffering, and agony to try and stop it. You get to follow his life and learn about his childhood and why he is the way he is, and why he does what he does. It really shows throughout the season that he can be a nice guy, and can have a bit of a charismatic charm to him, but he can also be a brutal, violent killer. When the show follows him around, and you start to get a grasp on the fact that he's an honest man, and that he seems to want what's best for the city, you start to begin to actually like his character, but then the show snaps you back into reality and shows you that he's a 2 edged sword, wanting to stop corruption and everything else that's wrong with the city, while he is actually corrupting the city as well. The character development for all of the characters is great, and the chemistry between Matt, Foggy, and Karen is also very good, and feels natural, rather than forced.. for the most part at least. The character of daredevil is very cool, the way he does things, and figures out how people are nervous, or lying. And the humor is good for the most part, but can feel a bit forced at times, but not to the point to where it gets annoying. Overall Daredevil exceeded my expectations but miles, it really is a great show. Marvel doesn't look like they'll be slowing down anytime soon. 9/10
