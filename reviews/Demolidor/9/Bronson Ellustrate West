What can I say? Growing up I was a massive Daredevil fan but in my later years fell from grace on that front. After watching the first episode of Daredevil, though? I'm all in.

Acting was great. Was it perfect? No, but that, like this whole review, is an opinion. I thought Charlie Cox was great as Matt Murdock and seeing as I haven't seen Elden Henson since the Mighty Ducks days and The Mighty, he was also really good.

The action sequences were tense and I honestly feared for Matt's life in some scenario's, which, as you all know, is damn near impossible when making a superhero movie or television show. I mean, c'mon. Are they ever REALLY in trouble? In this case, it felt like he was.

I've heard some people have compared this to the likes of Arrow and I can see that, but is that a bad thing? Don't get me wrong, it definitely differs from Arrow, but the approach to the series is ALMOST in the same vein. Again, NOT a bad thing.

All in all, I will be watching the rest of the series and I will be patiently waiting for Season 2. This show is truly a sight to see, unless your Matt Murdock... No? Alright, here's my rating.

8.8/10. Superb.
