If you like marvel, or like action, or like legal drama.....watch this show now. Great casting, solid acting/dialoge, superb directing, the action choreographers know what they are doing(little to no shaky cam. Brutal and violent at times, Netflix has their $%#$ together. A blind lawyer with his other senses superhumanly enhanced fights crime as a costumed superhero. Imagine The Dark Knight + Ally McBeal + Ong Bak Thai Warrior with a hint of HBO direction/violence. In other words a great time and well worth your viewing pleasure. I generally think defense attorneys are the spawn of the devil, but Matt Murdock is really my one exception to the rule. Marvel keeps getting better and better.

I will agree I wish he would get his suit on quicker instead of having panty hose on his head, and I wish there was a smidge more action/actual marvel universe main villains for him to have boss battles with. but still a great show and I can only anticipate this will all be covered in following seasons.
