Definitely what has been missing from superhero TV shows. Daredevil is enjoyable for avid comic book fans and any average Joe who probably hasn't ever heard of the character before. 

I totally recommend this for anyone seeking quality TV. The fight scenes are brutal and realistic. The pacing is great. Plotting: spot on. Definitely the best superhero show and up there with the best TV shows ever. None of the characters hold the idiot ball. Daredevil gives you a non-powered hero who actually tries to make a difference right from the streets. You want the short version? WATCH IT!!!!

I'd rather anyone reading this watch the show and form their opinions. But you won't be disappointed. Ever. You don't need to turn off a part of your brain to watch this. There is no cheesy dialogue. And the show is very consistent with its rules.
