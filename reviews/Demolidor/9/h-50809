I wasn't expecting much from this series as it's released only on Netflix and, well it's another superhero series. I was very pleasantly surprised that the acting, directing, script writing, etc are all quite well done.

OK the first episode began looking a bit low budget but that air had completely cleared up by about halfway through the second episode.

I always gage a series by how eager I am at the end of one episode to get stuck into the next. The writers did an excellent job of weaving plots together at multiple levels which always left me hanging for the next episode.

I have never written one of these reviews before but I thought that Netflix and the Daredevil crew deserved some credit for this series.
