Just completed watching the first season of Daredevil and it left a very positive impact on me(Mind you it is way better than the movie of Ben Affleck).

First season features on making of the Blind Vigilante. How all it happened and why did he choose this path.

Acting is top notch by Charlie Cox(Daredevil) like it comes him as natural portraying the role. Action scenes are very well choreographed with great stunts in it. There is right amount of emotions which drives the story and keeps it intact.

I would recommend to all who are searching for some fast pace action and crime series. My Rating 8.5/10(keeping 1.5 for coming seasons).
