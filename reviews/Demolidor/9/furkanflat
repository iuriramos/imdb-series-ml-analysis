This series is almost completely good. Fight scenes look more realistic than other TV series like this. Also the villain Wilson Fisk a.k.a the Kingpin has big potential and the series use him cleverly. However the daredevil outfit looks terrible and I wish it will change. Because costume is the most important part of heroes. If the director asks my opinion, which is impossible, I'd prefer more charismatic and cool suit. In the net, it is possible to see various cool designs of daredevil costume. 

Moreover, "season 2" will be pretty good with the Punisher and Elektra. I'm not sure Bullseye will be in season 2 but I want him in this series because he is also looks cool as the Kingpin.
