I am going to make this short and sweet. This is hands down the best Daredevil comic book adaptation to date. Everything in this series is near flawless both the storyline, characters and actors do the franchise admirably. Not sure how Netflix does it but hell! keep up the good work! My advice to anyone reading these reviews is to watch the series and prepare to be entertained. If your a daredevil fan than you definitely wont be disappointed. 

Not sure if this is a spoiler but I got to mention it. 

I almost *&#$! my pants at the end of the series when Daredevil jumps off the rooftop and posed in one of his most legendary signature leaps from the comic books with his sticks held high. Dam I love it!!!!!
