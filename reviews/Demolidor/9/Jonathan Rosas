I'm a little late to the party when it came to watching Daredevil on Netflix; however, the fact that I finished the show in three days, and I'm still craving more, says a little something on how addictive *in a good way* this show is. 

Let's start off with the acting. Superb all around. This is going to sound funny but bare with me: Charlie Cox plays blind AMAZINGLY. He nailed it on the head. And now let's talk about Vincent D'Onofrio. This is how Fisk is supposed to look, talk, feel, act. Keeping up with nailing parts on the head, Vincent became Fisk, and did a damn fine job at it. 

The characters are believable, relatable, and all around fun to watch. Watching Daredevil not only kick ass, but get his own ass knocked down on the journey. You get to see a side of Fisk that in my mind made him more human. He loves, he hurts, he gets worried, he's human, and not just some monster. I related to both characters, and because of that I found myself enjoying the show more. 

A small thing, but still worth mentioning: The opening credits visuals, and the music that plays, is simply amazing. It's mesmerizing, and addicting *humming along*

If you're a fan of the MCU, or if you're a fan of comics in general, or even if you're just a fan of watching good t.v., I couldn't recommend this show enough. 

Also, keep an ear out for the subtle hints to other characters in the MCU. 

Bring on Season 2
