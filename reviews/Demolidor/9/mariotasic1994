And boy did they. This is amazing. It starts off nice, and it keeps getting better by the episode. 

Honestly, I had my doubts. I love Marvel but they just kinda do the same thing over and over again. Plus I didn't know what to think of Charlie Cox. But I do now - He's perfect for it. So are the rest of the cast. 

This show, believe it or not has a much darker tone than the movies. And I welcome it. I just finished the second season. What a ride. All I can say is without complicating things is - watch the show. You will absolutely not regret it. 

Sure, I gave it a 9/10 because of course it has flaws, but they are tiny.
