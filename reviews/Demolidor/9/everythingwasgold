I watched this with high expectations, and it delivered! I guess the easiest thing to say to get the point across is, I can't think of anything I don't like about this show. It is a brutal, beautiful series. It proves you don't need a bunch of graphic sex scenes to make a series good, which is rare these days, and I love. There also isn't an over-kill of suspense to make you so frustrated you feel like you don't want to watch anymore, either... another thing that seems to be all too common these days. I'm impressed with the characters, the writing, and the way the the show is more true to the original daredevil story. But most of all, I think I've enjoyed the fight scenes more than anything. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE FIGHT SCENES! So, so good! This show is kick-ass like I haven't seen before! A MUST-WATCH!!
