This show creeps up on you slowly. It's a masterpiece in the long shot Marvel series Netflix shows with unique tempo as Jessica Jones.

Somewhere around the 9th episode you realize they are continuously taking the story into dimensions you never thought they would dare to go with a superhero. And that's exactly how Daredevil should be like! Fearless, beaten up, dark, rough, way over the line. Daredevil is crazy. And in this show you can taste that crazy.

And then episode 11 end scene comes and you're like: "Whaaat? Freakin hardcore! Two more episodes to go? I have no idea where will they take the show." So there are realistic fight scenes, sure. Awesome, he gets beaten up a lot, very down to earth stuff, great. But for me the character development was way more important.

Especially Mr. Fisk. Mr Fisk! Vincent D'Onofrio as the villain elevates the show into heights we rarely see. He steals all the scenes he has with the Mask. He real. How they flesh out his character is wonderful. He loves he hates he is passionate he is out of control.

I highly enjoyed this show.
