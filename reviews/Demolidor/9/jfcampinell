Matt Murdock, who was blinded by a chemical spill as a young boy, fights crime as a lawyer by day and as a vigilante by night. Despite his blindness, he uses his superhuman senses to demolish the criminal organizations terrorizing Hell's Kitchen. 

As a disabled person, I have a deep appreciate for stories about handicapped superheroes, like Matt Murdock (played by Charlie Cox) in Daredevil. But the fact that they decided to remake this epic story is certainly not the only reason that I must tip my hat to Netflix for their recent original series, Daredevil. 

I cannot praise this show enough for its unbelievable fight scene choreography, excellent acting, and striking cinematography. I also appreciate that in comparison to most Marvel series, Netflix's Daredevil adds an element of realism to the story with the addition of grisly deaths, an abundance of blood, and serious injury (to both the criminals and to our hero).

This show is addictive and immensely entertaining. Typically, I like to be a bit more eloquent. However, the most accurate word I can use to describe this series is: badass.
