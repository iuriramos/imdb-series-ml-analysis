Daredevil one of the best shows the year. Action sequences (inspired from various movies like Oldboy) are great. The plot keeps you completely invested. You don't hate any of the characters, everyone gets their proper share of the screen.The villain does what he needs to do. He scares the crap out of everyone whenever he is on screen. But at the same time he stays in the gray zone he is not a out and out bad guy. His character is best described by the story he tells at the end of the season episode. He believes he is the savior that the people need. And the biggest plus of the show, there are no forced relationship or personal drama like in Arrow and Flash. The only problem with the show is that you don't feel like the hero is blind especially when not in costume. The way others nod at him and he smiles at them looking at exactly where they are standing or acknowledges their response/reaction. There are couple of scenes where he is sitting in front of /using a normal laptop. Except for this small flaw, Daredevil is marvel's best on screen adaptation in either TV or Movie till date.
