American Television is currently experiencing a Golden Age. It certainly seems so because so many beautifully written and meticulously directed shows are on air today. And the ideas being brought to the table are equally worthy of praise. And I'm a fan. I watch Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, True Detective and have half a mind to watch Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire. 

But none of these shows have struck a chord with me like Daredevil. Let me start by saying that I grew up reading the comics. Daredevil's run ins with bulls eye, his team ups with Spiderman and his dark nature are all too familiar to me. And yet that is not the reason I loved this show. Treating the source materially honourably is one thing, going to excruciating lengths to unearth a deeper meaning is another. Daredevil will surprise you by exploring themes that no other superhero movie or show has done since Nolan's trilogy. It won't seem rushed and it won't seem forced. It'll seem as natural as it was meant to be. 

When Stan Lee created the Marvel Universe he wrote his heroes to be more human than super, and that's why Marvel overtook DC. With Daredevil, it's about as human as you can get.
