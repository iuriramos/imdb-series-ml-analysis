Daredevil is not the 1st superhero that comes to ones mind when asked "who's your favorite superhero?" This series has the potential to change that.

Review in one line: "Batman in the new suit and a more realistic world."

Since daredevil is not one of the popular superheros the series main focus is not on the superhero but is on the storyline. This attracts a broader audience since the viewers watch it for the story and not for what powers does the superhero has. The series is captivating and has the potential to be a big hit.
