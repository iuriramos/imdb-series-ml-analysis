I don't want to write about all the good things, I want to write about the things that make this series stand out from the crowd. 

1. The villain The villain is not a crazy guy who wants to conquer the world. He is shown as a human being with heart and passion. Yet he is brutal and a dangerous powerhouse.

2. choosing actors above models I am so sick of the Arrows and Smallvilles of this world. Marvel chose to pick actors for their roles above their looks. And it pays off. All characters are interesting. Don't get me wrong, there are beautiful people in this series, but those people can act and show emotion in a believable way.

3. Daredevil can be wounded Daredevil is struggling, sometimes the opponents are too much for him. You feel his pain and you fear for his life. Every time he catches severe wounds. 

4. The series takes it time The relationship between Fisk and his woman (I don't want to spoil) is slow and intense. It is not rushed, there are scenes that go on for minutes. I can understand that some people are bored, but for me it is very interesting character development. 

All in all, I am pleasantly surprised. Can't wait for season 2 and I hope it will be a devilish success.
