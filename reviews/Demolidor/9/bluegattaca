Season 1 of daredevil is some of the best superhero TV that I have ever seen. It's a dark action drama with a just a sprinkle of comedy in the form of foggy. Im a big fan of dark shows and movies but usually the superhero TV shows like flash and the arrow are more on the action or comedy side. Daredevil is a bad ass sticking it to the bad guys left and right and has a great villain in Wilson Fisk with great performances from all the actors. Season 2 changed some things that I'm not a fan of. Foggy has some lame lines and instead of being an awesome superhero they made daredevil go out of his way to prevent really hurting people that have killed others. Lame. Now I'm only 3 episodes in on season 2 but I already don't like it as much. Season 1 was a 10/10 and I wanted to watch each episode after the last one. Season 2 not so much.
