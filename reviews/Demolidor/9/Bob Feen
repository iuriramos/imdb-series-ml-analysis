So it took me a few days but I finally finished watching Daredevil and it was pretty great. I want to get the flaws out of the way first. First I felt that it moved along a bit slowly, not like they made it slow to be a more layered experience but to fill a 13 episode quota, Perhaps they should just write as much as they need to, no less, no more. Second I felt it was too dark, no not dark as in a dark tone but dark as in lighting. Action scenes are always at night time in a dark alley, I couldn't tell what was going on, only a rough idea. Finally it simply didn't do enough right for me to give it a 10, however it did get a lot right, enough for a 9. Now for the good. Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio pull amazing performance as the protagonist and antagonist respectively and the writing gives them many interesting layers. The antagonist of the series is so well written and layered that I struggle to call him a villain, only an antagonist, every other character is well written and well acted enough to hold their own in this series. Whoever was in charge of choreographing the action scenes deserves a pay rise, promotion and standing ovation all at once. Seriously you have not seen action this good since the Matrix. I also once again love the dark tone the writers have given us. Not campy, not emo, just perfectly dark. I am greatly recommending this series.
