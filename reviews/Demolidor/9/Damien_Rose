Comics were a part of my youth. I enjoyed a number of Marvel's heroes back then. There is no denying that the superhero phenomenon has enchanted audiences everywhere. Marvel has done an excellent job capturing the sentiments that drew so many to these heroes in our younger years. I'm not a kid anymore though and neither are a LOT of Marvel's fans. It doesn't seem to have impacted their success at all, but for the small portion of us hoping for something a little more "grown-up" from Marvel, Daredevil is the perfect show.

Daredevil always seemed a little like Batman in that he had no "out of this world" superpowers. Rather, he was formed by events in his childhood and grew up with a burning desire to defend the good people in his city. The double-life weighs heavily on aspiring lawyer Matt Murdoch, but he is seemingly "possessed" with the desire to cleanse his city of the wicked. A darker city, a villain that doesn't seem too far removed from some of our corrupt rich and powerful, bloodshed, violence, profanity, death, and betrayal. Daredevil doesn't feel dumbed down or softened in any way to appeal to wider audiences. That is precisely why it is so effective.

Now, if only Spawn could get a reboot that would wash away the memory of that horrid film as this show has done for Affleck's Daredevil.
