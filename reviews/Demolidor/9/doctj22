Not sure how much more I can add to all the other reviews but man, was this a great show. It feels like a 13 hr movie rather than a weekly TV show and I think this where the Netflix model really shines through. The content is mature and deals with real crimes like human trafficking, drug dealing etc rather than esoteric plots in other parts of the Marvel Cinematic universe. DareDevil was always one of my more favored superheroes and this approach is realistically set in a real (but dark) section of NY called Hell's Kitchen. Even though the premise is quite serious the characters aren't morose, in Marvel style there are liberal additions of humor in various ways with timely sardonic and witty remarks. Fighting scenes are realistic and graphic although they are toned down in the latter half of the season. All the characters (protagonists and antagonists) are well developed and from the earliest episodes you can feel that everyone including DareDevil can be in real danger and this tension presides throughout the whole series. The writing is excellent, dialog superb; you find yourself rooting for the bad guys at various stages of the story and yelling at the good guys too. Personally I think episodes 5-11 are the best but that doesn't detract from the fact that overall this is an excellent show not just a superhero one.
