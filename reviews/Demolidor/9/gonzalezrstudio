Hooked. I didn't expect to like this show so much. finally a refreshing adaptation of Daredevil - Matt Murdock - cut throat and tough, but also loving and vulnerable, hurting and torn between choices... Lonely, desolated, dark... this is daredevil, true raw emotions, raw fighting. 

One thing however that i really didn't like was the choice of song for Ben's funeral... I felt it took away from the sadness. Like, I wanted to be sad, but I couldn't because there was a soulful love song. Just a little out of place in my opinion. I felt the same for the song used when Wilson's men were captured, just a little over the top. 

I'm totally in love with Charlie Cox. I loved him in Stardust and I honestly wasn't sure he could pull off such a rugged role but my God he sure did. I was also pleasantly surprised with Woll's performance as Karen. I never watched True blood, but after hearing she was a part of that show I had low hopes and thought she would only be used to bring sexuality, but she has done a phenomenal job. 

I was a bit thrown off by the casting for Fisk, and at times D'Onofrio's performance was not very convincing for me. The same with Foggy, there were times that his character wasn't that believable for me. 

I give Cox 10/10.... 20/10 Lord I love him. 

I give Woll 10/10..

The rest of the cast would be a solid 6-8/10 for me. Not the best acting I've seen, but I'm sure as the show goes on it will get better. This is why I give it a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 (That and the choice of music). 

I'm a fan - ride or die 'til the end
