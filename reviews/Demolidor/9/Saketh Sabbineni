Disclaimer: I did not read any of these comics, Daredevil, Arrow or The Flash. Positive and negative part about not reading comics is not having bias. 

This series set a new bar in terms of a lot of things. I always had a perception that only DC has dark stories and has comics with deep meaning. This series changed that. I love both DC and Marvel but for different reasons. The fights were done exceptionally well. All actors fit perfectly in their roles. You could connect with a lot of them. Charlie Cox pulled off both Matt Murdock and Daredevil to perfection. I liked the black attire of both Daredevil and Fisk. 

The aspect I did not like was development of certain key characters which I believe did not justify the role they played and their actions likewise, specially Vanessa, Caren, Stick and Claire. But I think with the limited screen time there is only so much that the think tank of the show could do. Overall it was the right trigger for The Defenders and I'm going to definitely wait of Daredevils 2 and other Marvel series leading up to The Defenders.
