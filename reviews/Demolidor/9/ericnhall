It is nice to see shows given the time to develop these days. The Netflix and other titles that don't have to conform to network standards and don't have to generate instant ratings in order to stay alive for a full season are refreshing. Daredevil is one of these. It is mature, thoughtful, well paced, has great character development, great ambiance, and a really good set of stories. 

The old Daredevil movie with Benny was terrible. It did not do justice to Marvel's creation. But, this new series does. It is intelligent and gripping. It is dark and gritty without falling into a DC Gotham level of gloom. 

The acting is very good, except for some bad takes with Elden Henson playing Foggy that should have been redone or edited out (I blame the director in this case). I think that Vincent D'Onofrio does an excellent job as the deep and quirky Fisk. I find this Kingpin more interesting than even how he is portrayed in the comics. Fisk is disturbing to watch. He's is truly a terrifying character and D'Onofrio does an excellent job of it.

I love how the development of the "super hero" aspect of DD is very slow. It feels like a natural progression. This is something that is always missing from the movies and network TV series. I have very much enjoyed several Netflix produced content and am looking forward to more for this reason.
