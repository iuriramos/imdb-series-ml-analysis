Here are a few words to describe this Marvel/Netflix re-imagining of Daredevil: Dark, gritty, brooding. There are also some potential side effects if you choose to start watching this TV show: binge watching, lack of sleep, hibernation. All jokes aside Daredevil is a masterpiece and brilliant accomplishment. 

I have just finished watching the first season and I was utterly blown away by its brilliance. It hooks you from the start and does not let go. 

Like a lot of people these days I am a huge fan of the comic book universe. A universe that has the potential to be overcrowded and oversaturated by the sheer amount of TV shows and movies. I had not heard much about Daredevil but decided to watch due to it being based on a comic. This was one of the best decisions I have ever made! 

The cast was great, the setting was awesome and the fight scenes were exciting and well executed. Marvel and Netflix must be congratulated at exploring the darker origins of this character and pulling it off. 

I will admit that the production of the show is a little bit bumpy in the last couple of episodes, but this does not detract from what is a great series. 

I would absolutely recommend this to comic book lovers and fans of the dark and intriguing alike. 9/10
