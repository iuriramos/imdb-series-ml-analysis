something else is going on here in season 2, real conversations, complex emotions, bad people who are also good and vice versa, we don't deserve something this freaking good. Long scenes of very violent people talking, musing, changing their minds, I'm not sure where this came from or how it got produced. And there is great and not great acting and whole scenes of darkness and action, thank you Netflix, you can't get the good movies so make your own good stuff. Also, the production values seem much higher than most series, not sure where they got the budget for this. And to be clear, shows like the flash and the arrow genuinely suck and treat the viewer like crap, characters die and are resurrected, cheap production values, mostly lousy acting and writing.
