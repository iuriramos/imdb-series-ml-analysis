I am so pleased they got this right. It could so easily have been slapstick and unbelievable but it works and works very very well.

The characterisation is solid with good acting from some very competent actors. The grainy grubby look from the comic is there in spades and it is as good as the best of the Batman films without the big budget.

There is some good interplay between the main characters and their relationships and personalities work well together.

A lot of other reviews go into details about each character and the actor playing that role. All I will say is no actor stands out as they are all very good and simply fit together.

Good Directing, Acting and Scripwriting... what more is there to say ? watch it.
