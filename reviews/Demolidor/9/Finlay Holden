To start off, I have never read many Daredevil comics, but I have seen many of his appearances and read 'The Man Without Fear' 4-part limited series by Frank Miller after hearing that the show would be based on that comic in particular. This led me to believe that I knew what was coming

However, I was surprised by this incredible series Â– it took the best bits of 'The Man Without Fear' and developed it into a bigger story that allows viewers to easily become invested in the characters. The main thing I was impressed by was the representation of Matt Murdock, by Charlie Cox, and therefore I think the casting was great.

I didn't like the Wilson Fisk character because I felt that he came off to me as more of a simple minded and over-emotional child than a crime boss; on the other hand, I guess my dislike for the character was probably intended by the writers off the show. The acting by Vincent D'Onofrio was excellent, but I would like to have seen him established as 'Kingpin' by being named and shown in his iconic suit by the end of the series, as was done with Daredevil himself.

Rather than being completely chronological with his origin story it used flashbacks, which I was doubtful of but they were weaved into the story very well. I was impressed specifically with the development of Battlin' Jack Murdock and Stick because these characters could easily have been made bland and easily forgettable (like many other characters in the MCU), but instead were very interesting and I found myself paying particular attention to their scenes.

Similarly to 'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.', this show didn't feature any of the pre-established superhero characters, but Foggy Nelson (brilliantly brought to life by Elden Henson) did make some puns about the Avengers a couple of times throughout the series. This was as expected and not too disappointing when you see 'the man in the mask' kicking ass, and his unusual powers being shown on screen in a way that was realistic.

I have seen many posts about people thinking that 'Marvel can do no wrong', and although I recognise that this series was not completely perfect and there would have been things that I might have slightly changed, I'm really just nit-picking on a series that is an impressive achievement showing that Marvel can develop darker and grittier characters as well as the joyful heroes, and can make street-level crime feel as if it has the same significance as aliens attacking New York. I found myself becoming concerned for the main characters, which is rare in comic-book adaptations, where you know the good guys will live.

This show has brought a fantastic representation of Daredevil to the small screen that accurately depicts and develops classic characters that you will find yourself becoming immersed in. The casting, acting, editing and writing of 'Daredevil' are outstanding and I could easily recommend this show to someone who has never read a comic in their life due to the exceptional production standards of this Netflix series.

My overall rating is 9/10 - I watched all 13 episodes in one day and am already waiting in anticipation of the other 'Defenders' series'.
