Daredevil - The Movie was quite disappointing and to be honest that's what I expected from this Netflix Series as well. I've never been happier to be proved wrong. 

Charlie Cox, Apart from being incredibly droolie and having a smile that makes you smile (give me a moment here) is a pretty decent actor. Vincent D'onofrio makes you sympathize and hate him all at the same time. Elden Henson plays a very adorkable Foggy . The show is quite dark compared to the regular Marvel Cinematic Universe which is what makes it even more appealing, cause we all know life isn't a fairytale with or without a superhero.

The show brings out many emotions in you. There were times when I was literally scared for Murdock's/Daredevil's life,as he is portrayed as someone who isn't completely invincible as he is beaten up and thrown around by the baddies quite a bit. there were times when I was exceedingly frustrated with the power that money has over people, there were times when I feared for the life of characters and mourned their death and there were times when I cheered when people got what they deserved. Isn't that how a good series should make you feel?

The only minuscule flaw in my opinion was Daredevil's outfit, In my opinion it could have been better but hey.. I'm not complaining. I watched the 1st and 2nd episode and I was hooked and binged the entire season in a span of two days (would have been a day if I didn't have to work). 

I have nothing but positive reviews for this show. I hope and pray that Season 2 which comes out in 2016 is just as good or better than the season 1. CANT. WAIT
