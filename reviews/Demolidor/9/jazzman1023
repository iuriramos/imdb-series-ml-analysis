Less a 'superhero' story and more of a crime drama, Daredevil is a fantastic way to bridge the huge gap between street-level violence and aliens invading New York City.

With the Marvel Universe populated by larger-than-life characters- Gods, Hulks, billionaires, super spies- we finally have a fantastic depiction of the gritty underworld that flies under the radar of the 'big boys'. Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted with fight scenes that are just plain flawless, Daredevil is a gigantic home-run for Marvel and Netflix.

While the comic fan is sure to love this, the average viewer has plenty of meat to chew on in this series: brilliant lawyers, drug cartels, corrupt cops, love interests- the list is endless. The true beauty of the show, though, is the cinematography; it's dark, edgy and fitting for the subject matter. It makes you feel as if you're rolling around in the muck with Matt and you're knee-deep in the filth of Hell's Kitchen.

Bottom line: Netflix is putting out some gems- this is yet another one.
