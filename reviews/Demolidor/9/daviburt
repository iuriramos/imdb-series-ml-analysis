I feel this show would be great for anyone who has never heard of this character before. I have never read the comics or anything but I enjoyed this show. 

Except for Elden Henson's "acting" in this TV show I've been happily surprised by everyone's performances. I'm surprised that literally everyone they encounter in the movie gives a better acting performance that is 100 times better than what Elden is able to give his character. 

There's a really good review that describes his acting to almost exactly what I was thinking about his performance - http://tinyurl.com/q87s8t4

"I'm going to single out Elden Henson as Foggy Nelson, though, and say I thought his acting was bad. Like, the whole episode, he read lines like he was reading them off a cue card and hamming it up with his facial expressions. I hope he gets better." --- it never does but he does cry realistically.

With that being said about Elden, there is much to enjoy about this show that overshadow his role.

I highly recommend this for anyone but not with young kids around. Some scenes are quite brutal, one in which someone gets decapitated in a car door. <-- Possible spoiler =]
