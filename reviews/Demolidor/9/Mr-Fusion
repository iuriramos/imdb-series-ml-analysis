Two seasons in and "Daredevil" has become my favorite Marvel thing, more than any of the movies. I mean, this show gets almost everything right. It's true to the characters, it's very well cast, and the main actors work well as an ensemble.

The shakiness of the first season (mostly D'Onofrio as The Kingpin) is replaced by proficiency Season 2. It does a pretty great job with juggling new enemies and complications in Matt Murdock's life. They pretty much nailed the casting of Elektra, and Frank Castle was the utmost pleasant surprise. His big intro is a silent shotgun rampage through the halls of a hospital before shooting Matt in the head. Now that's an entrance. For the Punisher that this show is depicting, Jon Bernthal is first-rate. Give that guy a spin-off. Also, they offered up ninjas by the truckload. Ninjas! 

And the ultraviolence hasn't ebbed, either; still works on a psychological level. Sometimes it's even more than I can stand, which is surprising given the studio's prior shiny, safe M.O. But in the end, it doesn't matter, because I can't quit this. Truth be told, I'm more than a little annoyed that the show is put on hold for other Marvel series. Luke Cage? The Defenders? C'mon, seriously!

9/10
