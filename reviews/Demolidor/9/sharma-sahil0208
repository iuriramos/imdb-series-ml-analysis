DAREDEVIL, one of the most underrated superheroes, this is definitely the Dark Knight of MARVEL, Ironically... Daredevil syncs more with Bats than Batman himself..He can't see, but has great senses, And no gadgets..Raw combats..Plot is definitely on the plus side, with all the performances fallin right in place except a few characters which are given relatively more space..but yeah..that sounds surreal at times though..Cinematography does wonders with black background mostly..AND the presence of Mr. Fisk makes this series intense and make our Hero feel weak at times..which is a must to boost the adrenaline in the plot..Overall..Totally thrilling and entertaining.. Do watch it.. won't be disappointed..Don't expect one liners like other MARVEL Superheroes do..It's a classic soul with a modern skin..Keep Kickin!!
