First, the bad: I'm not a fan of Vincent D'onofrio. He's not scary as the Kingpin, he's just super creepy and pathetic. Like a quivering old baby. Not what I want in the Kingpin. Maybe there's something in the comic that portrays Kingpin in this manner otherwise I cannot explain why they cast the blubbering D'onofrio.

Other than that, in just the first four episodes that I've watched, Daredevil is the best Comic Book show to date. I like Arrow, can watch S.H.E.I.L.D. and the Flash, didn't like Peggy Carter, but am stoked on Daredevil.

I like his smart, honourable lawyer character. And the gymnastics and speed fighting he does as the man in the black mask. We rarely see such real speed in fight sequences. Not since Darth Maul perhaps in Phantom Menace. It's a treat. And can't be faked using CGI. Made me wonder if they'll ever get SpiderMan sequences to look realistic.

Maybe i'll update this after watching the first season, if D'onofrio ruins it for me or not. The rest of the supporting cast is good
