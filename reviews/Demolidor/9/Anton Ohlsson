Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) *spoiler* became blind when he was younger as he saved an old man from getting overrun by a chemical waste truck. As the truck barely missed the man, the barrels of chemical waste fell off. One of said barrels cracked open and splashed Matt in the face, burning his eyes and making him blind. When he woke up in the hospital, every one of his working senses had been heightened, making even the tiniest noise, smell etc enhanced to the extreme. 

I really enjoyed Daredevil. It made up for the god awful 2003 adaptation starring Ben Affleck (not that Affleck is a bad actor, he's just in bad movies). The first season is a balanced mix of action, drama and thriller elements, creating a very different "Marvel" series. "Daredevil" has always been a pretty interesting and unique hero, so I had high hopes for this adaptation, since the ads shown to the public were very promising. And I can gladly say that it lived up to all my expectations. 

Along with "Marvel's Agent Carter", this series stands out from any superhero movie or show. As it centers around Daredevil's actions to *spoiler* take down Wilson Fisk's criminal organization, it takes on a darker, more edgy tone as this Matt Murdock is even more violent and even more ready to do what is necessary. I loved how dark and mature this series is, since it is more in tone with Frank Miller's version of "Daredevil". With many interesting characters (even the side characters) and a well thought-out plot, "Daredevil" has become one of the best TV series I have ever seen. And, it is a lot better than 2003's "Daredevil".
