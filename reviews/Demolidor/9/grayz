This show is amazing! I really don't know what else they could've done to make it more perfect. The hero was great and the villain was even better in my opinion. This is the best marvel project so far. Netflix is doing great stuff with their super hero shows and no doubt they are going to continue to impress. I strongly recommend it even if your not a super hero fan, the other elements in this show is enough to keep you invested. It has a realistic tone to it and the other side to it is a crime/thriller. Also it tied into the of the MCU and thats a good choice in my opinion. This has some excellent acting and great dialogue, as well as references to Marvel movies and characters. You wont want to miss out on this show. Its worth your time.
