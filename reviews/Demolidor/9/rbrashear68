I was pleasantly surprised when I started watching this superhero series. After a disappointing big screen version done back in the early 2000's, I wondered how the quality of a series could be. It is great! The acting, characters, & writing all work extremely well. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a perfect 10 is the fact that it seems every fight he has with enemies is a struggle. The fight scenes are done well, but seems that all the enemies are trained to almost his level. I think that could be a little different as sometimes you want to see the hero take a normal bad guy and make quick work of them. But all in all, I loved this series. Way better than another from the CW that I am following. I am already waiting for season 2. Should be great!!!
