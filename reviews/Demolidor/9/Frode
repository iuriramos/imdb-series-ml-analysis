I'm not a comic-book guy, so I don't really know how accurate this series is in that regard. I have however really enjoyed the 7 episodes I've watched so far. Daredevil has the dark, brutal feel to it that I always missed when watching Arrow, and it really lives up to the "adult" rating in that manner. There are usually great fight-scenes in every episode. I also like the cast, which performs their roles really well and I generally cared about what happens to them.

There are details here and there that I find somewhat silly, especially how good his heightened senses are, which in most cases lets him "see" even more than a person who actually has eye-sight. Yes, I know it's a superhero-series but it still feels a bit silly that he can sense that there are 2 flares laying in a toolbox on the other side of a room he is in. One could argue that all superheroes are illogical, but that's not really my point. It's what the hero is able to do based on the premise of their "toolkit", like Superman being able to fly. I feel that Daredevil's "sight" is just a tad too good at times despite his handicap, superhero or not. 

But overall that is nitpicking, and when it comes down to it Daredevil is a really, really good show. I would give it 8,5 out of 10, but since I have to use whole stars for rating it's more fair to give it 9 over 8.
