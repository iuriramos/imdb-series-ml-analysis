Daredevil. Now, this is a TV show that sets benchmarks for television(for a comic/marvel series) in terms of sheer entertainment and just great drama. Daredevil is about a guy who is torn apart emotionally because of all the violence and evil around him. So he decides to wear a mask and fight it, as a vigilante. The kicker is that he's blind. But that doesn't stop him though as his other senses are so developed, making him actually 'see' more than the rest of us.

Season 2 upped the ante and everything else as it was more intense and kick-ass than the first season. A lot of new things happen this season with the anti-hero 'punisher', being introduced and stick comes back adding so much to the plot. The stunts and violence have been pushed to bone-shuddering levels to a point where it is refreshing that it is so raw. Actually it gets repetitive after a while, but I'm not complaining.

Overall, such a great show and the best thing about a Netflix series is that you can binge-watch it, instead of having to wait for an episode every week.
