The direction in this series is so impressive. But it's really the acting that is pulling me in. Charlie Cox is outstanding. Everything from his breathing to spoken word meticulously thought about. Rosario Dawson is smart, witty and tough with a side of buttery vulnerability that is really beautiful to watch. The chemistry between them is so gorgeous. Vincent D'Onofrio is terrifying even with just the simple action of a step forward towards someone. Toby Lenard Moore commands each scene with creepy grace. So many more actors all I could go on all day. Thank you for bringing almost a Madmen like quality of subtle script to a genre that so needed it.
