Daredevil has had two AMAZING seasons so far on Netflix. The show puts the 2003 movie to shame. I mean they take the idea of a child being blinded by radioactive waste and make it a very suspenseful, serious, and overall amazing show! The show stars Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock a lawyer by day and a mysterious super hero by night. As well as Karen Page and Foggy Nelson as his friends at Nelson and Murdock. The villain in season one is Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) and he is outstanding! He and his henchman try to take over Hell's Kitchen and defeat the Daredevil. As amazing as Season 1 was Season 2 is even better, it has not just Fisk but The Punisher, Elektra, and even more action and excitement than season one. I won't say anymore because you should just watch the show yourself. It is so GOOD. If I had one complaint is that the character Foggy Nelson has a stupid haircut but, that's really the only bad thing. I say you should definitely check this show out as well as Jessica Jones.
