First ,,, again as a second show i watch on Netflix after "bloodline" .. i truly love it ... showing a half season in a day is genius ,, it's like they're telling you "here's a whole season in a couple of days,then tell us what you think ."

So daredevil is not a new story for me ,, as an occasional reader of it's comics, watched the movie in 2003 .. so i can easily say this show has gone even beyond my expectation .. and if you've seen the Trailer the show is much more ;)

They presented a quick easy to understand introduction .. accident, burned eyes end of story we'll be back in a short flashbacks .. move on to more important story of now .. bravo .. The storyline is flowing perfectly so far, the crime solving, the action, the thrill is shining in abundance ,, the mysterious events seize the right moment to keep you plugged in wanting to know what's gonna happen next.

The casting is just spot on,, everyone is so emotionally invested in his character so you end up believing it is his and not to anyone but his.

The cinematography, the Visual special effects are perfect thou the soundtrack needs to rise to the occasion because it feels like it didn't hear any but in the final scene..

One episode is down four more to go for the rest of the day ;) and i know it's gonna roll in the same rhythm of sensational agitating events ... the action just begun, i'll keep you all updated :)

.................................................................... ........... Update.............................................................. ............. 

So the next 3 episodes moved steadily, the story flows perfectly so far no ups or downs, it gets clearer .. the problems in Hell's Kitchen start to appear.. I had some troubles finding much catchy soundtracks in the pilot but it actually grows noticeably as the episodes rolls. In episode 5 the suspense rise to a new level you won't wait a minute to watch the next episode. From episode 6 the story takes a turn to a tighter plot, focused on finding Fisk and his associates, his enemies until he become the center of the series in episode 8 ... In each episode there's a new interesting character emerges on the surface. As for the finale the "Horns" grow, had unexpected fast events leaves you speechless :D In all the episode there is always this shocking surprise they hit you with ,,

FYI: The renewal for a second season is still on the bubble..
