Blinded as a young boy, Matt Murdock fights injustice by day in "Hell's Kitchen" as a lawyer with his best friend, Foggy Nelson, and a recent acquaintance Karen Page. At night, he combats against the corrupt as a vigilante first known as, "The Man in Black". With the help of his colleagues, Matt Murdock cleans up Hell's Kitchen eventually becoming "DareDevil".

Though I am more of a DC fan, Marvel and Netflix's "DareDevil" was the best real life series adaptation of a comic book character I have ever seen. This Marvel/Netflix original series provides us with an incredibly addictive story, and superb acting brought to you by Charlie Cox (Dare Devil), Elden Henson (Foggy Nelson), as well as Deborah Ann Woll (Karen Page). And let's not forget the amazing choreography for every action sequence. Everything about this series was remarkable and a significant improvement to the 2003 "DareDevil"; however, the graphic realism for some scenes is not for the faint of heart, so parental discretion is strongly advised.

In the end, this series was both thrilling and mesmerizing! If you weren't a fan of "DareDevil" before, you soon will be.
