I must say, I was sold after the first episode. With an amazing intro, very strong realistic feeling and some very nice shots, the first season of Marvel's Daredevil looked like a strong contender for best new series, in my mind at least. It is thrilling more often than not, has a very serious tone and all the people blend in nicely with the story. And the charismatic crazy enemy, wow! 

Now that the second season is out, we have to see if it still lives up to the hype, and for me, it still has to show, but it definitely can. I had kinda the same feeling after watching True Detective: I did not find the 2nd season explicitly bad, but after such a strong first one, there are big steps to follow. Huge steps indeed.

So why the 9 star rating? Because the first season was amazing, and I am sure there is a huge potential still inside. I guess the second season had to be worse, but still worth a shot!
