Daredevil is by far the darkest entry into the MCU thus far. And not just for gore, but for the themes explored by both the heroes and villains throughout the season. That's right, there are no one-dimensional villains here: each of Daredevil's antagonists get their own trials, challenges, dilemmas, flashbacks, and have plenty of screen-time to see it all play out.

I'm normally one for lengthy, in-depth, spoilerific reviews, but I'm aware that such length often puts people off reading the whole thing so I'll keep this one brief with a list of the show's main strengths and weaknesses.

The strengths: Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson have an excellent dynamic as college room-mates turned partners-in-law; Karen Page steers clear of tacky love-triangle clich√©s; Leads are chased down from both sides of the law, forming entwining parallel narrative arcs; Matt's Catholicism is portrayed as an integral part of his character, as any faith should be; Wilson Fisk is perhaps the most compelling villain I've ever seen on TV: despite his obvious brutality I found myself empathising with him at times; Matt's adversaries are comprised of multiple factions, each with their own agendas: it's not just a case of hero-vs-villains; The choreography of a blind man fighting in hand-to-hand combat is a fascinating thing to watch; The pacing is consistently gripping: both action and drama are delivered in spades, with some major plot twists I didn't see coming.

The weaknesses: Things move a bit slowly towards the end of the season; Some minor threads are left unconcluded, presumably leading towards future miniseries.

All in all a very solid 9/10, with only small pacing issues in the last third of the season holding it back from a 10.
