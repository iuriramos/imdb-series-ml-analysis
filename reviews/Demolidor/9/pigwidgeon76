Daredevil is a fresh and surprising drama that centers around a handful of excellent main characters. In particular, Daredevil himself and his nemesis Wilson Fisk are fantastic, troubled and complex characters, far more than you would expect from a Marvel show. Wilson's assistant Wesley is also striking, basically Pat Bateman from American Psycho in the form of a lawyer and p.a. to Fisk.

There are a couple of hammy moments between Daredevil's friends Foggy and Karen, and an (IMO) unnecessary Ross and Rachel from Friends romantic dynamic, but this aside, this is a very well-written first series that made me want to binge-watch. There is some decent martial arts action too, but by far the star of the show is the moral ambiguity and the play between Daredevil and Fisk.

Excellent stuff.
