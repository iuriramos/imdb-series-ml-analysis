After watching many TV Series which are based on Marvel Universe and DC Universe, I never thought of watching Daredevil series, not especially after watching the Ben Affleck's daredevil. Still I watched after going through the trailers and reviews and much to my surprise I'm not at all disappointed. The series is really good. The acting although sometimes seen a little premature but overall I like each and every single episode. To compare it with the recently hit series Flash and recently concluded Arrow Season 3, I must say I'm more eager to watch the Daredevil series than those. The flash started good but lost its way in the middle where it felt sometimes that the story is not moving anywhere (concerning to the main storyline) and they had to bring the Arrow in between sometimes only to increase the attention and viewers. But this series is really fast paced may be due to only 12ep season but it will really keep you engrossed. I hope it will not lose its way like Arrow in the coming seasons. So my verdict: an excellent series to look out for. Great action sequences and plots. I particularly liked how they introduced and kept evolving the characters, the Hero and the villain, mixed with their pasts and present. One good thing which also working for the Arrow series, and if you see in the Flash that was lacking, the character build up especially linking it with the past. So go for it, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
