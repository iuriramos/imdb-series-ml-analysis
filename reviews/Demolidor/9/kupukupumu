First of all, I am not a big fan of Marvel characters, except for Spideman. Thus, I am not a big fan of Daredevil, but this series really get me hook and I can't wait for the next season. Yes, it is that good. I might say this is the best origin story I have seen. There is almost no flaw I can find with this one. 

The casts are great and the acts are good. The plot remains loyal to the comic books and follows Marvel cinematic universe, i.e., NY after Avengers, etc. This movie also makes us understand why Daredevil is a very important hero, although he has no power like Thor, Iron Man, Spiderman, etc.

It is also very well executed, better than the original wide screen movie. Thus, it is much better than all late Marvel's TV shows that I found boring, i.e., SHIELD. It actually quite similar with Arrow: the flashbacks, the main characters, etc., but better execution since there is almost no boring family drama here. 

Either you are a fan of comic books or not, you are going to love this.
