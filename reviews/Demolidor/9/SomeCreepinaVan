Daredevil is brilliant new show. It is nothing like the cheesy shows "Agents of Shield" and "Arrow." I don't think any comic book film or TV show has ever done the tone and feel of comics justice until Daredevil. The music isn't over the top and catchy, fight scenes are coherrent and shot at a wide angles with style, not shaky cam. The hallway fight scene was raw and beautiful. Scenes are allowed to play out and never feel rushed. The characters and story engage you.

Daredevil is about rawness. The tone is unique and very much Frank Miller-esque. It's not some gimmicy Avengers with clich√©d music ques and lame jokes or Nolan's far too boring and un-comic book like Dark Knight series.

Shot with the new Red Dragon 6k camera Daredevil looks great. It's easily one of the best looking and lit shows on TV. The digital colorist did a great job of fitting it with the comics. Backgrounds really pop with color.
