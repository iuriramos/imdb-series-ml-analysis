A solid and awesome start for Marvel's Daredevil. The show is gloomier and grittier than other Marvel shows. Although it is connected to the Marvel Universe, it has its own little spot, in Hell's Kitchen, separate from the other superhero settings. 

Matthew Murdoch has an impossible task, fighting poverty, crime, drugs and the very human evil that plagues common downtrodden citizens. It shows despair, hopelessness and one crime fighter being outnumbered. 

what i like about the Daredevil character is that although he has some superpowers (enhanced situational awareness to a point he can hear someones' heartbeat) he relies most on his courage and will power. It is the discipline and complete devotion to justice, to try to make a difference which makes it interesting, This is portrayed well in the show. To take out ten guys in a fight, it actually takes an effort, you sometimes take a beating, you bleed, you bruise, you get beaten down, but you must get up. 

Charlie Cox puts a solid performance, i am looking forward how the character develops in the second season. Oh, and not to forget Vincent d' Onofrio as Kingpin, a menacing and strong presence he has in every scene. He can sure play those roles well, an excellent choice.
