I myself was surprised by how strong of a 1st season Daredevil had, probably the best since Battlestar Galactica's 1st season. It brings to light a character that was ruined by an awful movie and makes us forget about how painful it was.

The show is incredibly well done on all fronts. Cox is a fantastic, charismatic Daredevil and Vincent is scary good as Kingpin. The fight scenes, rather gory for Marvel, are probably the best seen since the Dark Knight, and the writing of the show is Emmy-worthy.

There are flaws, of course, but it's rare for any show to have a truly flawless first season. I figure by next season, the show will have it figured out.

Do yourselves a favor and watch this show, you won't be disappointed
