I have just seen the pilot yet, and I am absolutely impressed. Charlie Cox is a wonderful actor, and he seems to have prepared for his role really well.

Stunt Choreography was a bit raw in my opinion, but I think that's what adds to the dark feeling.

There is room for humor with Charlie's law partner - Foggy and I liked to see Marvel giving it a slight touch of their lighter side.

It seems to have a well planned story arc, and I am so glad it is not a procedural type superhero shows. We have had enough of that.

All in all 9 on 10. Will binge watch over the next 2 days!
