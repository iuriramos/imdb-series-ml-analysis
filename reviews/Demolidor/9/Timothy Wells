Daredevil is a character I didn't know much about before watching the show. I wasn't too sure how i'd like the show since I wasn't a fan of the character before hand. If anything, the show has made me a fan of Daredevil. Everything about the show is well done. Fighting scenes are perfection. Some dialogue scenes were a bit slow at times, but that's the only complaint I could form after watching this season. His origins and early life were handled in a perfect way. Short flashback scenes every now and then made me actually want to see more, and the fact that the acting in all of those flashback scenes was great helped them really make an impact. I grew to like the characters, and cannot wait to see more awesome action, character growth, and Daredevil's epic story to continue.
