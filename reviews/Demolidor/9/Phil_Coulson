Let me start by saying that I liked the Daredevil movie quite a bit. I know there are a lot of haters for that movie, but I enjoyed it. Was it a bit over the top at times? Most certainly, but overall not bad in my opinion.

I've only seen the first episode so far, but this show seems to take the best parts of the movie and strip out the bad. Gone is the cheesy leather costume, replaced with a simple black outfit and bandanna- type mask, which to me actually fits better with the character. I'm not saying I'm averse to a suit upgrade in the future, but it makes sense that a blind guy wouldn't care how flashy his crime-fighting outfit is.

There's a trend in Hollywood lately to make superheroes grittier and darker. For some superheroes, this just doesn't fit. For Daredevil though, this is exactly what the doctor ordered.

Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.
