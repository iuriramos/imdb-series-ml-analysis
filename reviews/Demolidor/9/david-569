Lots of words in the subject that are evoked by this series. I am not much of a TV watcher. I am far less as in never a Marvel comic fan. As in never read a single one, and I am not young.

This has changed all that. This is a terrific concept and from what I have read a scintillating representation of the comic series.

Regardless of all that, yes, it took a but to get involved with the first few episodes. Being a martial arts person in addition to having been in the performing arts at high levels, the martial arts aspect kept me engaged. Well, it was into the second season, with introduction of The Punisher, that a switch flipped. A particular episode where the writing, the direction, and the performances were spot on. Everything just worked at a stylized high level.

The episode which I believe was season 2, episode 3, so captivated me, I regretted having never looked at comics in my youth. It was that stimulating.

Well done to the actors, extreme kudos to the directors and the concept/continuity team that threads it together. EXtreme judos to the martial arts choreographer, the camera crews. None of this happens by accident.

Years ago while in NY, and many memories of visiting co-actors who lived in Hells Kitchen, when cable TV was beginning to form, there was much speculation about where all this could potentially lead. As in work for actors beyond Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, traveling shows... there was much excitement. THIS is what I felt could happen. The Daredevil is what I felt could happen 30 years ago.

Very behind this work. Because this is what can happen when smart people come together. Well done ya'll's. I see this is evolving into another series. I hope so. For someone who does not care for television that much, this I can get behind.
