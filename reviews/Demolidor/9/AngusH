Daredevil is exactly what I expected it to be. Action packed however has an incredibly good balance between fighting and plot building. The acting is superb, character development has me on the edge of my seat.

Its not usually what people start of with, however the metaphors used through the church and the morals and ethics incorporated are a great addition to the TV show. I love how it showcases the hardships that come along with being the "good-guy" and whether what he is doing is actually in fact the right thing or whether he is turning into what he is fighting against.

I would go as far as to say the fight scenes are on par with the Batman trilogy, showcasing his powers in ways that are exciting. However when he does come up against an opponent that matches his abilities he doesn't come out unscathed. Often you don't see the superheroes of the box office having to spend weeks in bed in order to recover from injuries after a hard fight. So it is good for a change to show the actual damage a fight can have.

Supporting characters add a lot to the show. Often providing much needed comic relief. I've also found myself enjoying characters on the "bad side"and their personalities / character development. Both protagonists and antagonists are likable which makes the show all the more exciting.

If you're looking for a good TV show, one that will keep you captivated, wanting to watch the next episode and love Suits and Batman. This is the show for you. I would strongly recommend anyone with the time to start watching this TV series, it truly is up there with the best.
