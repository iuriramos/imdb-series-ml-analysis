Though I am a big fan of all the Stan Lee's work, I love Daredevil the most. Daredevil is poles apart from any of the mainstream super heroes. His extraordinary hearing and sixth sense instead of some divine power makes him a believable character.So, is the guy in the adapted TV series. The guy casting as Matt Murdock(Daredevil) personifies the character. He completely fits in the role tackling the main villain "whose name shall not be taken", who has also justified his role splendidly. Story is just like reading a simple comic book but the breathtaking action scenes and brilliant direction will keep one engaged till the end. One can easily guess what would be the end like, but it is fun to watch. I would recommend daredevil to anyone who has been craving better superhero stuff than Arrow or Shield.
