Marvel's Daredevil is darkly real where S.H.I.E.L.D. is just bombasticallysilly. Not that Daredevil isn't total fantasy, but it, somehow, grounds itself in something much more, well, believable. Thats kind of an oxymoron to be sure when Matt (Daredevil) constantly takes, and dolls out, more punishment than a human can. Still, this works so effectively.

The backdrop is New York's Hell's Kitchen and if there's a more virulent place on the planet, it's just as bad and can hardly be worse. Post mafia the Russians run the place with their criminal enterprises. But, they answer to Fisk who, in turn, answers to a multi- national cabal of colorful characters. It's all here, but the centerpiece is Daredevil the blind enforcer of justice in a microcosm of the shadow elite crime lordssort of speak.

Jumping off of a much darker, and real, set of criminals we get a central character who we can really get behind. His back-story constantly resonates with his innate sense of morality to create the perfect crime foil. And, he's a blind newbie attorney just barely scrapping by. What's not to cheer for?

Certainly it is a comic book hero come to life and as such one must suspend a huge degree of rationality. That rationality is checked at the door though and the events in which Daredevil must survive all have a grounding in something real, as opposed to the unreal nature of the evil forces S.H.I.E.L.D. has to ridiculously work against. You probably gather I lost interest in S.H.I.E.L.D. after a half-dozen episodes, but six in here and I'm hooked. This is an excellent adaption of a compelling comic book character. It lives and breathes outside paper as many comic book adaptations struggle to do. A definite recommended watch.
