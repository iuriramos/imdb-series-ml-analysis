As s fan of Marvel for as long as I can remember, and was surprised to hear that they were going to be making a Daredevil show on Netflix. We all know and remember that monstrosity that was the Daredevil movie back in 2003, and many people were somewhat against the show fearing that it may be as bad as the preceding movie. But this show is nothing like the movie in anyway shape or form.

Lets start with the plot. Blinded as a child, Matt Murdock is a lawyer by day and mask wearing hero at night. As the city is corrupted by Russians, Chinese Triad, and a drug trafficking Japanese gang, Hells Kitchen New York is slowly getting ripped apart. Above all of them is Wilson Fisk, or rather known in the Marvel lore, Kingpin. It is up to Murdock and his friends to piece together how Fisk is controlling the city, and how to stop him. Some parts can get a little convoluted, but is normally resolved within the episode.

The acting and cast is far better in this, than in the movie. Charlie Cox is absolutely amazing as Matt Murdock/Daredevil. Not only does he look like him, but the way he portrays him is excellent as well. Vincent D'Onofrio as Kingpin is easily the best (and in my opinion, the only good) Kingpin we have seen to date. My one gripe with him is how elegant he is. Wilson Fisk is supposed to be this huge menacing ruler, but in the show, he always seems so docile. Not a problem though. Supporting cast members Deborah Ann Woll and Elden Henson make up for the tiny cracks in the acting.

To conclude, Daredevil is one of the best TV shows/movies I have seen this year. The action is on point. Plot is a little messy in some areas but is cleaned up quickly. And the acting is far better than the original movie. If you are a new Marvel fan, watch this show. If you are currently a Marvel fan, the experience will ten times better. Daredevil did not disappoint me as a show, and I am very excited to see what happens in season two.
