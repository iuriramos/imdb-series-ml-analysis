I hate to compare Daredevil with Batman, but there were several instances where I felt like I'm watching a Batman movie. If you are a Batman fan, there are high chances you might feel like Daredevil is Batman's story, except that he's not a billionaire.

I wanted to know if Daredevil is actually a rip-off of Batman. After a short research, I found out that Daredevil comics became popular after Frank Miller started writing them. Frank Miller has been a Batman fan, but didn't/couldn't write Batman comics initially. Daredevil was written first, then Miller went on to write some of the best selling Batman comics. It is Miller's style and story setup which makes Daredevil and Batman seem similar. If you like Batman, you might like Daredevil as well.

Regarding the series, the performances are excellent if not mind blowing, the story is very gripping and everything fall into place making The Daredevil a good watch.
