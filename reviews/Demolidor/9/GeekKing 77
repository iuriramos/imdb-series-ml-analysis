One of the best shows you can watch today. I really liked the first season, but it was the second season that really made me love the show. It has great acting, great characters and a great storyline one of few shows I watch that I can say is perfect.It has a great dark gritty feel to it, and I still can't believe it's marvel since there is so much violence. Daredevil is the type of show that just gets better and better the more you watch it.I even liked the suit daredevil had in the show, even though at first I was not sure about it. Daredevil is one of my favorite super heroes ever, and this show just does his character perfectly. Other characters I love in the show are Foggy (everybody loves foggy) Wilson fisk, an great villain and punisher who is my favorite part of the show right now.
