As a huge fan of Daredevil's comic books the least I was expecting from this TV Series was a good story-telling and not a predictable story. The show delivered much more than what I was waiting. A huge credit to Netflix, which proves again the power and ability to make another thrilling TV Series. Different from many of other super heroes TV shows, Daredevil has a darker and realistic tone which fits very well to the characteristic of the character. 

While you're watching Daredevil you can notice influences of many important phases of character in the comics, but the one who stands out is Frank Miller's Daredevil, which is known as the best phase of all of Daredevil. Other entertaining aspect , if you are a fan of Daredevil's comics, is the number of easter eggs and characters that appear in the show, which are also known by their appearances in the comics, but in the TV Series, they aren't or haven't become yet what they supposed to be.

The fight scenes were awesome, they are made in such may which you feel sorry for what Matt Murdock(Charlie Cox) is suffering. They are very well choreographed and with such bloody and raw scenes, surely it's one of the most biggest hits of the series. Both the creation and the development of the characters is done in an incredible way, making such interesting and provoking characters. The chemistry between the leading trio, Matt, Foggy Nelson(Elden Henson) and Karen Page(Deborah Ann Woll) is great, the actors made an outstanding job in creating such likable characters. Regarding to the antagonism of Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk(Vincent D'Onofrio), both wanting a better future for the city. The actions each one is prepared to do to make this future to happen causes the line between good and evil disappear. Bringing to the series a very realistic air. I really enjoyed the series and can't expect for what they will bring of new to the Season 2.
