DareDevil was my fourth series I have watched in the superhero department after, Gotham, Jessica Jones and Agent Carter. Fair to say Daredevil is up there as the best if not the best I have experienced so far.

Set in Hell's Kitchen Daredevil is a dark, gritty, hard hitting action packed series which focuses upon his battle against Wilson Fisk a.k.a Kingpin. The first series sets up the scene of the dangerous mob ruled Hell's Kitchen and develops the persona of Matthew Murdock (DareDevil)and other characters very well in my opinion, giving you enough to understand them and feel for them at various times in the series.

My only reservation from this is that Wilson Fisk's character development was weak for Kingpin and was taken down too easily, however I am sure that he will be back and more Kingpin like in a later series *fingers crossed*.

This series is definitely worth the watch if you enjoy the superhero genre with a brilliant blend of story telling and action scenes. Would highly recommend!
