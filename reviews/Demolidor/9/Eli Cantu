13 episodes later! Marvel's Daredevil it's not a stretch to say it's the best thing to come out of the MCU for film and television! (personal opinion)

Daredevil does not need to deal with box-office return strategy, prime time restrictions, or broad-mass-appeal shticks and casting to garner a cash-grab audience. Not to undermine the empire Marvel has created. But there was always a safe-for-all gloss in any of the movies and TV Shows that are wittier and prettier then they needed to be.

The leash is off on the well directed, shot, edited, written, art direction and action choreographed TV show ( with a few exceptions ) Calling it a TV show even sound cheapening of what amounts to a 12 1/2 hour well done movie. Even overshadowing many of the MCU movies that are just trying to out-due the previous in spectacle and style rather then story and substance. Netflix with House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black, Marco Polo, and continuations like The Killing and documentaries like Virunga further beat down the traditional media outlets doors.

This old-boy-esque 6 min fight at the end of Se1 Ep2 scene without shaky camera, cuts, stupid radar vision, and a super-hero who never tires proves the discipline that show-runner Drew Goddard exercises.

BRAVO!!
