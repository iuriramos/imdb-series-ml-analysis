Excellent series. Made by marvels, Daredevil consist of everything a marvel movie has, even more. The whole series is like a series of 13 movies full on action and filled with drama and politics. Every episode starts with a bang and ends with a bang, especially the last one. The action sequence are way ahead of what i expected. I mean i have never heard of this character Daredevil. I first came to know about it from the show itself, but now i want to know much more and only because of this series. Now i think that marvel has done a great job launching this series and audience will surely want to see more of this. What to say about the actors, i liked everyone. Charlie Cox is so good in his role, he is the kind of actor whose face you will remember whenever someone says daredevil, even after other adaptations of this character are made. The trio Murdock, Rachel Page and Nelson is awesome and Vincent is wow! He played his role so well i became his fan instantly. This series is a must watch for those who like action, thrill and edge of the seat climax on every step of the episodes.
