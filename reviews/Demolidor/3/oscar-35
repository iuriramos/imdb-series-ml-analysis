Daredevil, 2015. 

*Spoiler/plot- Explores the early beginnings and life of the blind superhero, 

Daredevil and his life in New York City's 'Hells Kitchen'.

*Special Stars- Charlie Cox, Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, Vincent D'Onofrio, 

Roce Johnson, Jon Bernthal.

*Theme- Justice can be served by anyone with a good heart.

*Trivia/location/goofs- Takes place in New York City.

*Emotion- Better than Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell film. An overly 'gritty' and dark story of Daredevil's origins and his crime fighting work. Too much gratuitous violence and crime that make this series very hard to enjoy and watch, even for comic book fans. 

*Based On- Marvel's Daredevil comics.
