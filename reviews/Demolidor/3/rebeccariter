I was so excited for this, started first thing on 4/10 but really the story and scenes are so slow, like Agents of Shield slow. I don't understand why everyone is freaking out over it. Almost all of the action scenes are in the dark(are they great, are they lame, who knows????) and they are over before you know it. The few jokes are eye-rollers and there is a scene with Fisk and a date at dinner that goes on forever, I got distracted and forgot I was even watching the show until the explosion. To be fair I am only half way through episode 7, it is possible it will get better but I will probably not waste my time finishing, there are so many other shows on my list. D'Onofrio and Woll were excellent.
