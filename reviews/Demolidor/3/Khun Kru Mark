What a load of long winded rubbish.

You can fit all the action scenes in to a half time Superbowl show and STILL have time left over to watch... the half time Superbowl show!

This bloated, wordy drama should have been edited down to a 'made for TV' movie... but that still wouldn't be enough editing to keep anyone awake.

I'm guessing the writers are teenage girls as this is the cheesiest bilge-water I've seen from a Marvel franchise.

Every camera angle is a close up head shot so there's NO sense of atmosphere or space.

I watched the whole 13 crapisodes (with the fast forward button as my friend) and I still don't know why the bad guys were so bad. It's never clear why they are bad or what bad things they do. But they are enemies of the Daredevil and his puerile, panty-wetting chums... so they are the bad guys.

Oh... you only get to see the Daredevil in his Daredevil costume at the very end of the very last episode... well... let's hope it's the last episode. A second series of this melodramatic tripe would make my eyes bleed.

There's way to much blubbering in every episode. What is it with Americans and crying on the telly. They just can't stop themselves, can they! There's also way too much talking and all the talking is in stupid riddles.

The limited action scenes are filmed in pitch black so you have to guess what's going on. The fight sequencers are tedious, long and difficult to make out.

If you thought that Brian fighting the chicken was long and tedious then you're in for a major shock... this is longer and more tedious with the added distraction of being impossible to see!

If you're a Daredevil fan, stick with the comics. This garbage will just bore you to death.
