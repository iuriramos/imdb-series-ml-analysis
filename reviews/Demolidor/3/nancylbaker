I have been a huge fan of this show and really impressed with the acting and writing. Loved the "gritty crime drama" feel it evokes.

I am now no longer a fan. I will no longer watch this show and no longer will I endorse this show on any social media site!

I know that every American is allowed to voice their opinions, as I am exercising that right by writing this review. But, the cast, as well as the producers need to keep in mind that we are in the midst of a very contentious political race right now. Not just opposition parties, but with in the parties themselves. People, like myself, see this as a very pivotal time for the country. A make or break, live or die, election. That being said, the fact that Rosario Dawson steps out and not endorses, that I would have understood, but criticizes a candidate or a moral issue like abortion is a game changer. Audiences are diverse and can run the gamut of the spectrum, politically and morally. She picked a very bad time to make this type of political move. I would say that I would convince all my friends to not watch the show, but none of them do, so not an issue. I will no longer endorse the show on any social media site and will make sure to include that fact in any of the many posts I make a day on a very wide range of political sites.
