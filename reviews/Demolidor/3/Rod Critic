It was hard to keep watching the first season. Im not the kind of person who watch one episode, I keep going to the season ends. This time, almost quit.

The plot is good, the somber scenario is good, but this guy Matthew Murdock is he really blind or not?

Please watch the episode two (Season 2) You see a guy in his apartment with battle hangover and seems is not blind at all. Is this a misdirecting goof? Or it because his senses are upgraded. 

I stick in season two because I wanted to see The Punisher. Jon Bernthal is AWESOME. In comparison, Daredevil looks ridiculous with his costume. The Punisher looks more real and bad ass.

Elektra is good, the casting acting is excellent. I think this show is for kids. Im so glad the nightmare is over. I don't think I'm going to watch The Defenders. I will skip it.
