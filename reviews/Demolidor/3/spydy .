FYI, I'm not a comic book fans at all, hence this review is based on quality of the TV show itself with no bias at all.. 

I found that DD review in this page is so biased. My expectation was set so high, esp after saw all these review from IMDb, only to be disappointed after watching it, and my GOD last few episodes are not good at all.

DD is like ripped off version of batman and the raid combined into 1 show no plot. It's like watching green banana turn yellow, so predictable and boring. The only good thing in this show the fighting scene, however good fighting scene alone is not enough for me. this show is super overrated, thanks DD fans who obviously never watched a good, dark & gritty show in this world.

I want to rate this show for 6/10, however since so many biased review here i hv to lower it down to 3/10
