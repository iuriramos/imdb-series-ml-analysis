I have rarely watched a show where I wished so much for the demise of the protagonist, sadly Murdock couldn't lose a fight if he tried. It gets old and predictable way too fast. The boy scout clich√© in particular makes me detest this character, he is as one-dimensional as they come. I get it, he's catholic, snore. I am not often one who struggles with the suspension of disbelief but I did with this show. Each episode has a plot point that is seemingly random and never seems to go to anywhere, they only serve themselves. The basic story structure is fantastically simplistic and I mean if you're looking for just really typical archetypes it has it all. I'm convinced the writers just filled a bowl with tropes and just grabbed ideas out; the plucky journalist who just wants the truth, oh look some yakuza, some Russian mobster in a gulag, that's a good one, rich guy obsessed with minimalism, yep got that one, blind samurai, oh hey that's original. The writing is just lazy, this show is completely over-hyped and leaves you with a sense of "hey, haven't I seen this before?" because if you've watched any of the other marvel shows or really any show featuring lots of hand to hand combat (Alia, Dollhouse) it's basically go out, fight a guy, win, rinse and repeat, but don't get too close just yet, oh look another pointless tangent and now we're back.
