Daredevil is marvels best show yet! It has a different tone the the Marvel cinematic universe. It is much darker and realistic, while still having the marvel identity with great snappy dialog and subtle humor. The characters are also one of this shows strong points. Charlie Cox is fantastic as daredevil, just as every actor brings heart and value to thief characters. The crime element of the show is also another sting point. People who are fans of the character Daredevil, will love this show and people who are unfamiliar with the comic book hero, will enjoy the show as a crime show. This is totally different to the usual marvel movies, but is yet one of the best marvel features. I hope that marvel keeps going in this direction, with a more serious tone, but yet keeps the fun jokes and dialog. The show is incredibly violent, but as I said before keeps its marvel feel. This is obviously the best marvel show yet! Go Daredevil. I'm hoping for season 2!
