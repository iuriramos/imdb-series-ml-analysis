WOW... This is a good t.v. show, Good job Netflix for finally making more of a adult themed superhero show for us adults that still like to and want to watch superhero entertainment. I am a adult male in my mid 30's that actually like superhero t.v. shows so please Arrow, S.H.I.E.L.D, Gotham, Agent Carer and The Flash stop feeding us this b.s teeny bop-per crap. I know those are on network TV but good job NETFLIX for being the first to make a real superhero show. AMAZON PRIME please take notice and make a show just as good or you guys will lose some serious money just like you probably are now with DAREDEVIL. Actually any subscription t.v. channel take notice.
