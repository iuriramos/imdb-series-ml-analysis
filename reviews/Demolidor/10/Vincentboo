Not the biggest fan of reviews as sometimes it's all subjective anyway. Wow this blew me away. Pacey is an understatement. Emotion's in bucket fulls. The introduction of new characters masterful.The plot well thought out and measured. There is a lot of superhero stuff out there all competing for the same viewers. After season one i thought it would have made top ten. season two top three.Deborah Ann Woll puts an Oscar performance in and proves women are more than eye candy. The writers need to take a lot of credit as the lines are dark and edgy but work perfect with the very occasional humour. Daredevil is a perfect example of how to mix the ingredients of good v evil and make a perfect pie. It will be difficult to follow this one but i will be watching season three without fail
