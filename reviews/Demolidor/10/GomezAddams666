Charlie Cox stars as Matt Murdock, lawyer by day and vigilante by night. Blinded as a child from a horrible accident he's grown with the ideal to make his city a better place by either defending the innocents in court and/or punish the criminals in the streets.

Vincent D'Onofrio stars as Wilson Fisk, a kid from Hell's Kitchen who's grown to become a powerful entrepreneur with beyond powerful connections and political influences that will take the city by storm at all costs. In the war between Murdock and Fisk sacrifices will be made and legends will be born.

This is Marvel Studio's first TV-MA property and it is very well done. Nothing to do with 2003's disaster this show is magnificent, well written, incredibly well directed and the characters are very realistic. 

The problem with the 2003 attempt was that the characters were cartoon-like and not realistic at all. Wilson Fisk especially doesn't start as the boss of bosses of organized crime but as an entrepreneur that has to face his own fears as a human being and find the courage needed to embrace his destiny, while Murdock starts off as a simple guy that wants to see his city become a better place, then he is vilified as a criminal and a vigilante known as "The Devil Of Hell's Kitchen" and he has to embrace that role to fight a merciless network of crime that will stop at nothing to gain the power they crave.

The stories are very realistic, the characters are wonderfully written and magnificently played by the actors and an amazing supporting cast that includes Deborah Ann Woll (True Blood), Rosario Dawson (Sin City), Ayelet Zurer (Man of Steel) and Elden Henson (The Butterfly Effect) among others.

Marvel has succeeded again at pleasing the Comic Book fan base that has put them where they are and at captivating the general audience. Loved by the audiences and critics alike this might as well be The Best Live Action Comic Book Television Show Of All Time!
