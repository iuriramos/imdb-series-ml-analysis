From the first episode itself you know, this is not just another Marvel's attempt to make a TV show with stupid characters throwing some crap in the face of the audience just to fit in the ever expanding MCU universe (that honour goes to agents of shield), but exactly the opposite.

A brilliantly written well made show with characters to care for, with an intriguing plot to look for, and the right amount of intensity and pace to keep you on the edge of your seats... what else do we want.

It's nothing like marvel has ever done before it's dark yet fun to watch not like any other superhero where you kick someone's butt and everything goes back to normal, it's relatable more closer and deeper, what goes on in the life of a saviour against the world of devils.

The cast is bang on! Charlie Cox did a very good job though Vincent D'Onofrio stole the show for me, he was amazing. the supporting cast was great and the character development was so well done that you might end up wanting to know more about them...

Daredevil, aka Matt Murdock, lawyer by day and vigilante by night, he is basically marvel's version of batman without the wealth and gadgets (which is what makes it look a bit more realistic) also the action sequence specially in second episode is fantastically done.

It's the best thing marvel has ever done so far and one of the best shows out there... don't miss it.
