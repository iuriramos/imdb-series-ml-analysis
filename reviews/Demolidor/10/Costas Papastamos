Save yourself and don't start watching daredevil. It will set your standards so high that you won't be able to watch any other superhero series and gain satisfaction.

So let's be more thorough. In the first season the characters are introduced, some are likable, some are not but everyone is perfectly connected to the story and is there for a reason. There are no secondary characters or "filler" episodes.The villain is not the classic dumb guy who wants to destroy the world because of reasons, and the hero is not the classic untouchable, indestructible dude who just beats everyone because he can. Plot twists happen more that often, especially in the second season, without however losing their value. 

I admit this series got to me because it plays with your emotions in a frustrating but yet so mesmerizing way. It never sacrifices its story or character in order to provide us with cheap visual effects like others do.

The only sure thing is that i will keep watching it. 10/10
