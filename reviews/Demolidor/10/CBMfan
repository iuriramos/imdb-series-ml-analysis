I was a bit weary going into this series, I've never been one to enjoy violence, or dramas. Daredevil is the exception. Charlie Cox is so amazing and convincing. The courtroom scene, Matt Murdock's emotional breakdown towards the end, he has found a new fan in me, hope to see more from him in Marvel projects. and Vincent is so frightening and perfect. Finally a great TV villain that scares the complete s*** out of me. (end of episode 4.... just wow). I love how vulnerable they made Wilson Fisk. You want to empathize with him, but you know that he is also a complete monster. The addition of Vanessa is great. the symbolism with her wearing white all the time was something I appreciated. Rosario Dawson as Claire is so great. I hope we see her crossover into the other netflix series and the Defenders. While the violence is so much, it really showcases the gravity of the situation. It's necessary, plus shows how bad ass Daredevil himself is. Loved this show, Hope to see a season 2 announced soon.
