Definitely the hottest series I have seen lately.

It went over my expectations and blew my mind up.

Magnificent work in every part of the movie making. I wasn't so sure about it, because of the super-heroism, but the whole series is so grounded. The series has everything, it doesn't let you take a breath. The cast is giving breathtaking performances and maybe at some point you even get to love Kingpin. Two days were enough to clear it :D

I totally recommend this to everyone, even to the "I don't like the super heroes" people.

Just watch it and let it amaze you.

Cheers
