Daredevil as the name suggests means daring the devil and well this TV series has indeed challenged how action scenes are made. The best thing about this throughout the two seasons have been its cast and the direction which is fantastic. After watching season 1 i thought maybe the next season may not be that much great and might crumble due to the expectations from the 1st season but hell I was wrong and wrong by a huge margin. This series not only deserves a good review but a huge round of applause. Sometimes it so happens that we sometimes overdo these superhero thing but for the 1st time in the case of this TV series I was anxiously waiting and tracking the news of season two and boy it didn't disappoint me. With addition of Elektra I thought how would they try to fit her but let me tell you they not only fit her perfectly but Elodie Yung after her performance has increased her fan-base exponentially and I am proud to be one. TV series these days contain many filler episodes to kill time but Daredevil it doesn't even have a filler minute. Everything is so smooth and detailed that you can never question any scene. Finally, the action scenes are the best part of it and they are there in almost every episode and never depriving its fans from the action. Hats off. Can't wait for season 3 will be one of my longest waits.
