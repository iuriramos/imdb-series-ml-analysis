Just excellent! I started watching the series thinking what or how different would the directors pilot the story after a literally no hope of continuation of the story since Affleck's role in Daredevil 2003, and just the first two episodes of Season 1 made me so intrigued to continue..a great portrayal of the character by Charlie Cox. The series has excelled all my expectations and this is definitely what Daredevil fans across the globe have been looking forward to. Truly wonderfully presented with a lovely story line, mind captivating - with minimal special effects that bring a dark side to the whole plot - wonderfully done! Hats off to Neflix for a fantastic series ...
