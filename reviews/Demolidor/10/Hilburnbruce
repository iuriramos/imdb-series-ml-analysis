This is honestly the best thing since slice bread. This show has finally in my opinion given Netflix made shows a good rep. I was skeptical when I first heard of this but it was way, way beyond expectations and definitely raised the bar. If you don't have Netflix. Get it for this, even if it's the only thing you want to watch. It's well worth it and well worth any amount of time needed to watch it. I will be looking for season 2 and plan to binge on it the day it's released. If you're looking at this wondering if you should watch the show. Don't think. Just watch. I've been in that situation before watching this and someone did the same for me. This show captures your attention and won't let go until the last episodes over. You won't regret seeing this. This has everything a good t.v. Show should have and yet so much more.
