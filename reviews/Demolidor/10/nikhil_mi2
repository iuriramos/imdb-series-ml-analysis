Daredevil is the Quintessential MARVEL SUPERHERO by far. The rest I mean THE IRON MAN, CAPTAIN America, THE AVENGERS are just ways to make shine and Hyper advertise marvel to teenagers and young adults into spending their money on BGRADE marvel heroes.

Daredevil is the real deal. The Character, the Story, the plot, everything is sublime and Beautiful. Thoroughly worth enjoying every moment. More importantly THE Whole thing has a HEART. Something that the Avengers Lack altogether. Therefore it is the best. Yes its brutal, violent, gore even, but that was how DEADPOOL was advertised, and Frankly DEADPOOL was a bit Disappointing. This though is very satisfying right till the END.

Ps:- Second Season is way more fun than the first
