A gem produced by Netflix and Marvel. An absolute 'NO NONSENSE' action packed thriller that wont let down your expectations no matter how many times you watch it. It's one of the masterpiece that shows even minimum amount of CGI is more than enough to make a really good superhero series/movie. It has done everything that Affleck's Daredevil movie didn't do, and it didn't do what Affleck's Daredevil did. Performance of all the characters, especially Charlie Cox is definitely up to the mark, if not above. It's definitely one of those series, which you can watch more than once... And believe me... It will keep you on the edge of your seat every time you watch it..
