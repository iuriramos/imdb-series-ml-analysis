Netflix' Daredevil isn't what I expected at all. It exceeded every bit of mine. Almost everything, from the plots, fight scenes, and the most importantly the characters are very real and within grasp. Matthew Murdock isn't our usual hero, he is a blind lawyer with the ability to do things right -- but that doesn't mean he isn't vulnerable and fragile like a normal human being is. Foggie and Karen reacts on the right direction, as well -- as expected from a mere human being under the pressure of the situation. Wilson Fisk is very susceptible -- his background story, as well as the one we've seen him write. Fisk is the kind of person who is actually scared to speak to the girl he likes, and Wesley is another friend of his who calls his girlfriend to calm him down in a difficult night. The variety of culture is wonderfully portrayed, as well -- though pictured as the role of the villains.

I haven't exactly read the comic books, but I have seen multiple Comic-TV series airing as of the moment and I have to admit that this one is by far the best among the rest. Maybe there are flaws that I failed to process, but in total, all I can say is that Netflix' Daredevil solicits relativity and empathy from the viewers because of how realistic everything is constructed upon.
