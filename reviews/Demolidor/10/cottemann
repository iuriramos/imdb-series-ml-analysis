This is the Marvel show we have all been waiting for. It takes place in post Avengers New York and criminals are taking advantage of the city. What I like about this show is how naturally it fits in the world already created. The question has come up recently that there are several heroes in the universe that cant hold up their own movie but that people want to see. One of the ways was to include them the bigger hero's movies but it never feels like they are doing the characters justice. Then someone got the idea to do TV shows for them, and while Marvel Agents of Shield is one of the worst shows on television, Daredevil works great and I hope the Jessica Jones and Luke Cage are just as awesome.
