I had high expectations for it and boy I wasn't disappointed,I was pleasantly surprised.They are truly true to the comics in this one,the portrayal of the characters is excellent and their relationships is amazingly represented.The choreographed of the fighting is beyond expectations,each one is closely designed without any weak points.I loved to see how they walked the path to become who they really are and I am eager for more.With the villains they created the idea of a tirade of criminals representing the evil in each nation but also the way which they were brought to justice.I loved Daredevil's red costume even though in pictures looked kind of unworthy of such a great TV show
