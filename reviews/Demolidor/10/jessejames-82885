Didn't really have any expectations for Daredevil. After watching the movie as a kid and not overly enjoying it, I think Marvel has done an amazing job now that they have Daredevil back in their control. I love how mature it is compared to the other movies/shows Marvel have been doing in the MCU. The dark tone and violence they have incorporated will please a lot of people that have been wanting to see that from Marvel (me included). The cast and the writing are excellent and I look forward to possible appearances by other characters that Daredevil has either worked with or fought against in the comics. Very excited to see what else Marvel can produce with their characters that have yet to hit the screen.
