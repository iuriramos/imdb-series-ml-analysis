Whenever a new TV series or movie is announced based on one of my favourite comic book heroes, I try not to get my expectations to high, but I can't help it most days and I come up with how I think it should be. With Daredevil I did the same and wanted it to be a darker layout than the rest of Marvel but most of all to have a long intriguing story. And I wasn't disappointed

From the get go I was hooked, the show manages to leave behind the faults of other programmes with their repetitive nature and instead include a ongoing narrative with sub- plots that weave into the main story. The acting and casting is perfect that makes you actually feel for the characters, unlike with Gotham, with the humour of Foggy being a relief from the tortured soul of Matt Murdock. D'Onofrio is perfect as Fisk and is different from any villain i've seen and Karen Page is a great character who has fallen victim to the violence in Hell's Kitchen. There are shocks and twists to enjoy but it's the fight sequences that amaze, when you see episode 2 you'll understand.

Bring on season 2.
