I'm having comic book fatigue... loved X-men, loved Avengers, Thor, Iron Man, Capt America... etc... That's a lot of Marvel comic book films... Do I want to invest myself in a 13 episode series on Netflix?

My initial answer is "NO!"... I liked the Ben Affleck film enough, but I'm a tad bit comic booked out... and then my friend told me to watch it. And then critics say "Watch it"... so I said fine. One episode.

Daredevil is legit. It has enough of everything to keep you satisfied. Some of the episodes feel like a Jason Borne film. Some episodes feel like Law & Order. The acting is phenomenal... Some characters are comic book'ish, but the fight sequences are fairly realistic. Overall it's a fun, dark, good, gritty show.
