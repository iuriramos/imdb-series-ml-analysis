I thought I knew what to expect, it is after all a Marvel superhero story, but it was much more than I thought. A great story: completely character driven and pitched perfectly. Interesting characters: no one seems to have it all figured out, everyone has both internal and external conflict. Brilliant acting/directing/editing: it would have been so easy for this to have slipped into a campy feel, but it stayed hard edged and subtle. No one was one dimensional. Satisfying action: in a world of guns, a man in a stretchy shirt doesn't stand a chance - even Bruce Lee weighed in on that topic - but the way every battle was handled took almost all of the 'unrealistic' out of it. The fight scenes are rich, full and no one walks away without a scratch. I wanted to watch this series because of Vincent D'Onofrio - Thanks, Mr. D'Onofrio! I loved every minute of it!
