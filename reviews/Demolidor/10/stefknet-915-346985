Well that was a big surprise!!! The quality of the marvel character and tNetflix, ware promising a good outcome for us all, the marvel admirers. The result was far better than expected. The actors were so carefully been chosen (or by great luck) that just fitted the original comic characters. The story is more dark and cruel even when Mc Farlane was drawing Spiderman. Except the 4 good characters the best of all is himself the actor that portrays the Kingpin!!! Where has he been??? His is so great that I thing that he may have some real problem in the future with his career. He is the real Kingpin... What other role he can now incarnate??? My compliments to the producers, the actors and world web that let us watch that great series, even here in Greece. and I hope that the show will be continued...
