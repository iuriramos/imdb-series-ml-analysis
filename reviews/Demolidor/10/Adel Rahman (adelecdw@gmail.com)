Oh I've waited a long time for a Comic book TV show like this. A show which can be compared to other shows like The Wire or Breaking Bad. Daredevil does that.

I've watched many comic book shows (Arrow, Flash, AOS etc) , but all of these network TV shows had the same villain of the week formula and the corniest actors ever. Especially in Arrow which BTW takes itself way too seriously. Albeit the storyline is pretty good. But still doesn't warrant for the bad/underdeveloped characters. Also the Teen Soap drama in Arrow is bloody annoying. Probably why I skip most of the network shows.

But Daredevil escapes all the the network show clich√©s and creates its own unique style. I don't think I have felt so emotional by watching a Superhero show. The characters are very well defined .The storyline is just phenomenal. The whole show is beautifully shot. Fight scenes are expertly choreographed. Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio are excellent as Daredevil and Kingpin.

Daredevil also shows that Network television is the worst thing in the history of worst things. Nothing will ever good if we rules and restrictions are constantly being shoved in our faces. That applies to all things in life.
