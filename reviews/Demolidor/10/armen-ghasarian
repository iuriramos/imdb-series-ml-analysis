I was skeptical about the show, I love the symbol of daredevil and I expected a lot. I didn't want a typical super hero TV show like flash or arrow (who I love by the way) but Daredevil needed to be darker, stronger. 

And the results was here. We have very strong direction, the work of the Fisk and Daredevil character are very well written. I feel the director was very inspired by the Dark Knight Trilogy by Christopher Nolan, including the role of the villain, who Vincent D'Onofrio plays perfectly and approaches the quality of a Joker (Batman :Dark Knight).

I hope the season 2 will be at the same level as the first!
