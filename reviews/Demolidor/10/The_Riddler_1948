If you're looking for the perfect superhero/comic book-related TV show, then look no further than Daredevil! This show is mind-boggling. It truly is a wonderful show and it's by far the greatest superhero-related show I've seen (and this is coming from someone who loves Arrow and Gotham). 

Charlie Cox is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. He nails the lead role as Daredevil. His performance is somewhat unexpectedly amazing - yep, it's that good it's "amazing."

I cannot wait to see more of Daredevil because its take is fantastic. And yes, it's even rather violent/brutal, and that makes it all the better since Marvel are, well....they're not known to Violence that much, let's just say that. But yeah, Daredevil has fantastic actors w/ fantastic acting, great scenery, unbelievably good fight choreography (yes, I love the fight choreography a lot in this show), and so much more. Be sure to check out this wonderfully awesome TV show - it doesn't disappoint in the slightest.
