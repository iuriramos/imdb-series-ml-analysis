Daredevil has always been a character that I've enjoyed in the comics but never been a massive fan of, however, the first series convinced me that done correctly a superhero series could really bring a character to life and they certainly did that with this series. Whilst a slow burn (the first four episodes take patience to get through) once it gets into its groove the remainder of the series is exciting storytelling at its best. Charlie Cox completely nails Daredevil and Vincent d'onofrio is superb as the Kingpin. And then series two came to be featuring my favourite comic book character The Punisher. Series two just kicks straight into the action and the story arc of bringing the Punisher into being is excellent. Jon Benthal is just brilliant. He brings the punisher straight out of the Garth Ennis series of Punisher Max comics and onto the screen. The Punisher is exactly as the comics portray him. Even when the series comes close to making him appear soft they go straight back to what the essence of the punisher is. The direction is excellent, the plot is taught and never leaves you wondering about what's going on. If you're a fan of Daredevil or the Punisher, I highly recommend watching this show. Even if you're not a fan then there's still an awful lot to enjoy about this series.
