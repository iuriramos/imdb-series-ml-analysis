When I decided to watch this series, I thought that it was going to be a boring version of the movie, or at the most another attempt at turning a comic book hero into a fast action-packed TV show like "Arrow", "Smallville" or "The Flash"... boy was I surprised! "Daredevil" is witty, well-designed and superbly delivered. The script is rich, it has a darker tone than any other similar show and the casting couldn't have been any better! The one-shot filming makes it so real, the episodes are all connected and the plot evolves in a smart yet stimulating way... it kind of reminds you of "Damages" in that matter...

A must-see for all lovers of the genre :)
