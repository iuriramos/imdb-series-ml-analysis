I'm a long time lurker of IMDb, but I have never written a review before.

There's nothing I can say that no one hasn't already said. This show is amazing, and is a must see for everyone.

I do wish it was a tiny bit brighter in some scenes where you just can't see what's going on at all. I understand the dark tone but it would be nice to maintain the darkness while still being able to see what's going on.

Not to cause a dispute, but I think Arrow does a better job of lighting management when it comes to dark scenes (just my opinion).

This show is fantastic though, and if you haven't seen it yet, I suggest you stop reading this review and start watching it now!
