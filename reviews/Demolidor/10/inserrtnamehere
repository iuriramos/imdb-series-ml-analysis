I have not read the comic books, but based on the level of sophistication, intrigue, and suspense that the show exhibits, I can only guess that it does do the comics justice. In terms of a TV show, it has everything you expect from a series: the beginning has a great hook, the finale is superb with just the right amount of suspense for the next season, and everything in between is solidly great. This show is dark, elegant, and sophisticated. The dialog is eloquent and the fight sequences are superb. Normally in any action movie, the camera angles are so shaky and the shots keep switching from camera to camera so that you cannot see the action that is really going on. But in this show, more often than not, one still camera is focused on the fight so that viewers can keep track of who is throwing punches and who is receiving those punches. In some action movies, the fight scenes are choppy, a little cheesy and a little unrealistic. But in Netflix's "Daredevil," the movements are fluid, the acting believable, and the fighting incredible. Not once when watching this show, have I cringed at the dialog or rolled my eyes at any plot twists. Talk about a well written, well edited, well scored, well directed, well casted, well played out, and overall well put together show.
