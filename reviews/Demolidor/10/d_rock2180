To me, this is the best show out there. I love that it's raw and broken down to story telling. No flashy special effects, I wish they would put a Batman series out like this because that story needs to be told like this one. I was never a big fan of Daredevil before but this is done perfectly. The acting is done so well and believable. Perfectly casted. The only problem I have with this show is that I have to wait till next year for season three. Well done, can't get enough. I love Netflix is creating an opportunity for so many jobs in the industry due to not having slot restrictions. I would love to be screenwriter and write shows like this, raw and qualitative. This is how a lot the darker superhero shows should be done. Or even go a different route, do origin stories of great villains... Joker anyone? But none the less, this is the best show out there... Hands down.
