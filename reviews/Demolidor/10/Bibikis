I don't know were to begin to describe how surprised and taken back by watching this series. 

First of, lets be honest. The Daredevil "franchise", within the media aspect doesn't/didn't have a really great reputation(unnamed fiasco will be unnamed) from the get--go. So I didn't expect much from this series when I decided to pick it up, mostly because I've finished everything else there was to watch.

Oboy, I'm happy I did. I can say without a doubt this climbed to the top of my priority list with in the first few episode.

The characters are lovable and grows on you really fast, great cast of actors, perfect for there respective roll to play. The phase of the series is perfect, I love to get to travel from the start to the end together with all characters and can't wait to continue to do so.

The fighting scenes... oh my gosh!. The fighting scenes, choreography, environment, sound and effects are fantastic! Very Christopher Nohlan's Batman-ish in terms of sound. I just love it, all of it.

So thank you for doing this, I hope, I look forward to another season and everything beyond that as well.
