What an amazing work!! Simply remarkable, always have been the "Cinderella" of Marvel Daredevil, but this is just outstanding and it certainly fixes what they ruined in the 2003 movie. I cannot wait for Season 2. The casting was amazing and the plot of each episode maintains the viewer in a shock status that will not let you stop watching. They took a small hero that was buried in 2003 and made a blossoming adventure. I am specially glad that this is not the typical superhero series where everything is childish and everything has to be censored and limited. Kudos to Marvel and Netflix for bringing us a marvelous hit and for uncovering the fantastic story of the no longer dormant DAREDEVIL.
