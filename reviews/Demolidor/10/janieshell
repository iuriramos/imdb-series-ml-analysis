WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!! Having seen the first two episodes Daredevil was a surprise. Everything was spot on the casting, the writing, the fight scenes. It is gritty, there are moments of humor provided by Foggy, Murdoch's best friend. Rosario Dawson's character of Claire is particularly interesting. One of the highlights of the show, are the flashback scenes, I like how the father and son is touched on more than in the film version, providing more of a gut-punch when Jack's inevitable death does come. Charlie Cox is very convincing as Daredevil, he nails all aspects of his character. Another thing I like about this show, is the fight scenes, and the cinematic tone. Bottom line Daredevil is an amazing and I look forward to seeing more of it.
