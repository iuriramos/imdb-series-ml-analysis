Daredevil needed this because Ben Affleck nearly ruined the character and now Charlie Cox has outstandingly revived the character. OK so I'm just going to pick the most memorable parts in my opinion of the first season. The first episode hit me really hard emotionally, right off the bat with Matt's confessional session in the church, which Charlie Cox makes you feel his pain and his damage. When he talks about his dad letting the devil out and losing it, it just made me almost break down to tears. Episode 2 has a masterful fight scene, very reminiscent of The Raid and OldBoy. The constant focus of the fight and capturing the brutality, made me love this show more. Elden Henson sometimes got annoying as Foggy, but he played the character very well. Deborah Ann Wolf was really good as Karen Page and I can't wait to see more development of her in season 2. Episode 6 was excellent to me because of the intensity Charlie Cox brought and the dialogue with him and Wilson Fisk, played brilliantly by Vincent D'Onfrio. Scott Glenn was perfect as Stick and his past with Matt will come into play next season most likely. Elektra was sort of referenced as the Greek girl Matt took Spanish class to talk to. Loved the acknowledgment of the rest of the MCU, worked very well. Charlie Cox is the heart of the show and he is astoundingly perfect for the role. Vincent D'Onfrio was unlike anything we've seen from a villain in the MCU and he's exceptional. Look at the wall and think about what you've done... We love you Marvel.
