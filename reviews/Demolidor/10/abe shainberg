One of the best shows I've seen on TV in a long time. 24 was the best show ever. It had everything. So how do you take a comic book character and make it interesting? You get a great writer(s) and director and superb cast that seem to fit each part like a glove and develop everyone's character. Deep, deep characters. You get to understand the motivations, desires, goals and personality traits of simply all in the cast. This is no cartoon show. The writing is superb, the music haunting, the graphics unbelievable, the camera angles artistic, and the plots are written in an arc, very simple but such that explore both the protagonists and the story line in equal measure. Of course you resigned this show - keep it going for years!
