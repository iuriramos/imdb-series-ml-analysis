I am no TV show fan, and I didn't like Daredevil before the show. But after i watched the first episode, i fell in love. It's a full experience life of Matt Murdock, it shows his fears, memories, loneliness, and loyality. It doesn't have a bad episode, there are some ''not perfect'' moments, but all in all, it's a great show. And his suit looks great in season 2. It look weird at first, but seeing it in action, and looking deeply in to the red eyes, you've understand that it looks just right. The villains are very interesting, with rich backstory's. And Punisher in the second season, acted by Jon Bernthal, is perfect. Much love to this show, would recommend to watch, even if you're not a comic fan.
