I've always wanted to watch a TV show that contains serious villain, real crimes and not that special superhero powers. A huge message for the people who dislike or maybe "step back" from a blind person. You must respect everybody. Characters have their weak moves of reality sense but sometimes even art can't save souls. And there are many points from the plot that I love but they would be spoilers.

Great job in acting by the lead roles. The script is almost perfect; there are some sins and we know "there is no movie without a sin". I didn't like the ending and the main reason it would be that I watch the whole season less than a weekend or it would be that the writers didn't have options for season 2; which I definitely am going to see! 10/10
