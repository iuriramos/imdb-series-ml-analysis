Not a hardcore comic book/ superhero genre fan. Wondered into this space and liking this one. Definitely far far far better than the style over substance Gotham.

The lead didn't wow me at first - found him a tad too mundane NY metrosexual salaryman, which turned out to be by design. He's a fine fine actor capable of authentic deep emotional delivery and the character is well crafted indeed. The female characters were nicely done too - captured the retro noir-ness in style yet their attitude updated for 2010's.

Visual style wise, no complain. Very consistent. Mood wise, dark, nights, brooding, (too)bloody, violent, yet enough humanity and complexity and depth and moments of beauty.

Logical consistency...well... Superhero genre tends to overkill the hero's power. This hero actually suffers injuries, no, more like, goes out looking to inflict and receive injuries. Turned out to be character design too. The friendships and justice themes are nicely weaved in too. It's nice to have heros and villains with human limitations, makes it more believable and relate-able.

Looking forward to the sequel. Definitely a popcorn in your living room classic. Recommended.
