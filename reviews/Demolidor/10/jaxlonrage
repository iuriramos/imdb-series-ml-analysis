This story might start out a little bit cheesy, but it quickly finds its feet and it grips you more than you can possibly imagine... A good way to learn about the hero (Ben Affleck did a terrible job) and frankly it is better than any superhero series I have ever seen. A proper series for all comic book fans, and people unfamiliar with Daredevil and the Marvel comic book universe, it's a great experience for all audiences. I must admit to some faults though (Matt Murdock although blind, uses a Touch screen smartphone... Isn't a phone with buttons better for blind people? Just a thought.) but you can hardly take that in seriousness with the genius of storytelling in which you behold... Once it has its grip, it has you real firm, for you are always on the edge of your seat finding out more and more about his past and about the events in Hell's Kitchen... A proper mature superhero series (unlike Arrow, The Flash, Agents of Shield that I found a tad bit boring) I recommend this to all audiences...
