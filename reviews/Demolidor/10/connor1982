I've just completed watching all of season one of Daredevil. I didn't start watching until the whole season was out and ended up pulling a marathon viewing of all 13 episodes because I absolutely could not stop. This is one incredible show. The casting is perfect. The fight scenes are superbly choreographed. The story is gripping. It is dark, brutal and gritty. I've been a fan of hero and superhero films and TV shows since I was a child. I've rarely been so impressed by any that have come before. This is an absolute must watch for any comic fan. Honestly I don't think anyone can watch this and not love it. The only negative is now having to wait for season two, its going to be an excruciating several months, but at least it gives me time to watch season one several more times. Bravo to all persons involved in bringing this to us, bravo.
