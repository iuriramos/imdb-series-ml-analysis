I found this show pretty amazing, it is much better then arrow and flash. Daredevil is unlike anything marvel has ever done before,show is made in a dark way and has most amazing action i have ever seen in any series. Plot is also interesting and season one is just the beginning,it keeps us waiting to have more of it. Daredevil is just the beginning it sets a base for future marvel shows which are coming on netflix .A.K.A. Jessica Jones is coming this year followed by Luke Cage and Iron Fist and finally they all will get assembled in Defenders So daredevil must be seen for all future marvel shows and films.Besides it 'Daredevil' Charlie Cox is has great acting skills
