I started watching it out of boredom. Shows like this don't usually impress me, but by episode 2, I was completely and irrevocably hooked. The characters are deeply flawed and extremely human, even the main villain is superb. 

The script was fantastic, with some of the best lines (delivered without clich√©s) I've heard in a long time. This series makes you feel confronted, exhilarated, contemplative, satisfied and repeatedly taken aback by its twists and turns, and that is per episode. It's an experience that will resonate with you days after watching it.

Each character is given a chance to intrigue you and make you feel invested. 

The action sequences are completely kick-ass! As someone who couldn't fight their way out a wet paper bag, even I'm inspired to join a martial-arts class and go back to the gym. Some of the violence is confronting, but necessary to this dark, brooding masterpiece.

This is the product of when great people get together and give life to something even greater. I ended up watching all 13 episodes in season 1 within a week. I just could not look away.
