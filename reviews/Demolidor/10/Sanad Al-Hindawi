One word: BRILLIANT! 

This show is seriously one of the best (if not THE best) superhero show I've ever seen! Season 1 started amazing, kept contestant until the finale! Awesome writing, awesome character development, awesome action.. And above all, THOSE FIGHT SCENES! Then season 2 comes, and doubles the brilliance! The villain, the build up for the events, and the new characters just made the show 10X better! 

Really can't wait for the third season! I really didn't think it would be this good in the first place, I just watched it from all the fuss, and people shaming Arrow and Flash, while praising Daredevil. Never thought I'd actually join them! 

Amazing show, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
