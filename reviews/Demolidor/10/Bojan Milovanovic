Not having watched many superhero themed movies/TV shows, I was really surprised by this one. Now I'm 8 episodes in and I am truly amazed. The 8th episode, mostly with the background story, made me vote 10 on this show. It is very well written and directing is just amazing. The acting is credible and characters are well-shaped. Although I can't really comment on the superhero specifications of the show, I can assure you that technical stuff of it- the writing, directing, effects, and acting- are just flawless.

Having it compared to Arrow- it is much more credible and enjoyable, and in my personal opinion, it is in every aspect better.

My vote: 9.5/10
