As a person just looking for something to watch, i clicked on Daredevil since it had a 9.7 rating when i first started watching! and Bam... i was binge watching that bitch! it kept me in a continuous urge to watch!

The characters! the acting, story and what daredevil does that i haven't seen a whole lot...is it gave back story to the antagonist! And that's what made me really like it, cause it made you feel some sympathy to the antagonist!

Fisk, yeah he was bald, ugly in a way, and had a very bad temper, but can you blame him for having an abusive father? like for real?

Punisher!!! for one, i haven't gotten passed episode five yet, and my god did they hit me hard with punisher! they started the show off with a "Bang" and they jumped into their story immediately!! how the punisher was victimized by what he believed to be the Irish gangs/company within Hell's Kitchen!!

The Punisher lost (i Believe 2 young girls, i could be wrong!!!) and his wife to a shooting. so he tried to pay back at the killers! How Punisher showed emotion in a way that i call prime acting! just shows how much the cast of this show try their best to give all their effort to make a damn good show!

S1= the progression of the characters, and the relationships both the antagonist and protagonist have with their friends/family makes the show feel more realistic. the amount of blood, realistic prosthetics and science that goes into the making of season one was a very good specimen of entertainment for me! the language to me makes me feel kinda on edge, but its giving people in the show emotions people would normally express if they were in such a situation! drugs/Alcohol is at a seldom amount but its still pretty noticeable at times. and this season was in a dark setting half the season, mostly at night, which for younger viewers could be slightly frightening! All in All....S1 9.5/10 i recommend season 1 to anyone who is interested in 1. marvel and 2. a very good and well thought out show!

S2= so i was waiting an entire year for this bad boy to come out! and its so good. the first episode you literally watch an entire room of Irish men get gunned down, blood spraying everywhere, you see one man gets shot in his neck. foggy and Matt have grown their relationship exponentially from the last season. they are actually talking to each other, laughing...and it just shows how time actually passes between seasons of a show, time doesn't pause from the season finale of season 1 and then starts back up at the pilot of season 2... there is interaction that the viewer can clearly see through the first episode of season 2, the crew did an excellent job giving the viewer that sense of passing time between seasons. 

DD outfit looking bad-ass and all that, his epic hearing still amazes me, and how his "Sight" is improved from last season. you can tell by the way he is more fluent in his motions with hand to hand combat. 

The Punisher is mentioned at the very end of episode one, and is brought up again in episode two. DD loses a fight with him at the first face to face encounter. but then he comes back at him, but then the Punisher takes him "Captive" i guess you could say. and there is a weird bond they make, and TBH i fell asleep half way through so i don't know what happened, but I'm going to watch it again... ha-ha!!!

Season 2 for DD for me is honestly a great addition so far, a milestone for say! 

violence so far in the first four episodes that I've watched is really high, there is a gun in almost 90% of the show so far. a man gets shot in the head at point blank range. a mans face gets shredded up by a Spas-12 shotgun. the Punisher is seen in cuts a bruises on his face, he gets his left foot screwed through. DD gets shot in the head, but his helmet helped out a little. a whole room of Irish men were gunned down, and killed with only one survivor. DD somewhat tortures people for information, by bending and literally breaking their wrists.

Drugs/alcohol is seldom still but you can clearly see a few times the Irish may have had more then they should!

Language hasn't been decreased at all, its still a vulgar setting. and its a perfect mix, there isn't too much to the point you feel its a terrible show, or too less to the point you are asking why its rated TV-M! its a very well mixed use of vulgar words, i'm not aware of any racism or other racial slurs.

Frightened and intense scenes aren't very noticed in season two, but when you start watching the Punisher you get kind of chilled out when he stares someone down with the bruises he has. DD and his red eyes taunting his enemies could be frightening to younger viewers. Punisher pulls out a razor blade from his forearm to escape duct tape, and you can see blood spilling out of his wound, as well as flesh giving the viewer full view of the exposed skin. this can be frightening to some.

So far S2 is 9.8/10. it is by far the DD show milestone. I'm very impressed, especially with the realism and obviously seen effort the cast and crew give to this show!

DD is a very good show, don't waste time on anything else. do that after you finish the whole show on Netflix, then you can waste your time on other show until the next season gets uploaded.
