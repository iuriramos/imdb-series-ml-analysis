I cannot praise the new daredevil series on Netflix enough. I have told everyone I know how fantastic this show is and want the world to know it as well. Spartacus was a great show as well and I can definitely see some of the influence in daredevil. There is a fight scene in a hallway where daredevil is exhausted and barely standing but keeps fighting for a good cause and it is all shot in one uninterrupted sequence. The camera never cuts away and daredevil is so realistically portrayed, I was speechless. Kevin smith tweeted the same sort of praise shortly after my husband and I commented on the scene. How very validating! I hope that this show continues to thrive and is appreciated by millions as much as my family appreciates it. There are no hokey effects or cheesy one liners to try to make the show popular. I love the flash show that airs on cable but that show is definitely made to appeal to the pop culture masses. Daredevil is so genuine and almost believable. This show should be at the top of your must list!
