Firstly I am a huge Marvel supporter and a fan of the Frank Miller run. Despite the awful performance of the last installment in 2003, and the mockery of what has become my favorite vigilante. This TV series explores all the elements that a featured film cannot provide. Matt Murdock; portrayed by Charlie Cox, has been revived to it's full potential. Inspired by the Christopher Nolan's Batman franchise, this embraces the fact that heroes are breakable. And where better to do so than Hell's Kitchen.

This TV show has brought in many aspects of the MCU that the movies couldn't, in doing so this show has become my personal favorite. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys pure entertainment.
