Let's start of by saying that the first season of Daredevil was great in almost every way.So i expected a lot from the second season and i gotta say it is better in almost every way. The characters are very well realized and they do things,it's not like they are saying that they will do something and don't do it,in here they just go for it.You fell like Matt gets very beaten not only in the Daredevil costume,he gets beaten psychically and it really reminded me of Raimi's Spider man trilogy.Foggy is also great because he takes things into his hands and you fell that he is confident yet scared.The only character that i don't really like is Karen because she's just normal,she mostly just look at something in the archives or does research which is not really all that fun like the rest. My god The Punisher was a phenomenal character that Jon Bernthal played so good and bad ass yet he is just a man and he has a past and is vulnerable like all of us. Elektra is a woman and yet she is so strong and makes decisions on her own.She is one of the most bad ass women in TV shows today. The action is so well directed,like the staircase scene is mind-blowingly awesome.But not only that every fight scene feels special and fresh and raw and really brings a fresh air to the scene. The storyline is very good.I always wanted to know where it's going to go and how it will end.Every scene feels necessary and no scene feels out of place.Everything ties together so well and it has a very natural flow. I loved the second second season of Daredevil and i thinks it's even better than the amazing first season.
