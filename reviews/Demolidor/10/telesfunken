I don't know where to start. Daredevil is a complete success to me so far. The first season was already a very pleasant surprise and the second one is doing great. Maybe even better, if that's possible. The recipe is complete. You have a great script, great actors, great production value, the fight scenes are worthy of any multimillion dollar budget movie, without being too fancy. It's just believable. The actors clearly give their all and their all is just what we want. You really hate the bad guys and you really love the good ones, but there are the ones in the middle and you know what? They make sense. Kudos to the writers and I guess to the whole team. Lighting, director, casting crew, producers, caterers and cleaning ladies, the whole deal. This is a real treat and puts TV Shows like Arrow to shame. Which is not that difficult, I would say, but still true. This is not just a pretty boys and girls parade, this is not just a TV Show showing off what they can do with some tricks of lighting, choreography, stunt men and women and a whole lot of money. They show you substance, characters you can relate to or at the very least sympathize with. There are real dialogs, that people could actually have and the reactions are always appropriate whether you agree with them or not. At first I didn't know where to begin and now I'm finding it hard to finish this. I'll just say that I really recommend this TV Show.
