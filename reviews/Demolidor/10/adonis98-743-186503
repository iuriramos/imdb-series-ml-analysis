They said that Marvel couldn't go dark but it did and the series is R- Rated this is one of my favorites Marvel TV Shows next to Agent's Of Shield. The Cast is great and the battle scenes are amazing especially that Hallway scene EPIC. A really great TV Series and i can't wait for the new Season to come out in 2016 my only problem was the Red Daredevil suit it looked really cheap like those Fantastic 4 suits. A really great TV Show like i said and you really need to watch it if you haven't see it already because Daredevil is Badass and Epic and i hope all this wait really worth it because i really want to see the Punisher and Elektra!!
