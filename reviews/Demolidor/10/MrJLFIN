To me, "Marvel's Daredevil" is one of the best series ever crafted. I was a huge Daredevil fan growing up and it's been my favorite comic book character from Marvel. This was the perfect way to tell the story of The Man Without Fear.

Storytelling is incredible and the plot very intriguing. Episode after another, the series just gets better. The show runner, Steven S. DeKnight surely had a clear vision how to approach Daredevil and he did a fantastic job. The world of Daredevil is not an easy one and the dark, gritty environment was done so well.

About the casting... Charlie Cox totally delivered a strong and a noble performance. He's just the man to play Matt Murdoch. Such an amazing actor. Menacing and sometimes very emotional, Vincent D'Onofrio's rendition of Wilson Fisk, was such a thrill to experience. These two gentlemen deserve some kind of recognition of their portrayals for sure.

The action sequences were shot beautifully and it was glad to see Matt Murdoch's vulnerability when fighting his enemies. I loved the simplicity of the vigilante suit and was positively surprised when Daredevil appears wearing the legendary red horn suit for the first time.

"Marvel's Daredevil" is the first of many Marvel's Netflix series. "Marvel's Jessica Jones" will air on November '15 and if they can keep up with the quality of writing and acting, then these characters and stories are in safe hands.
