Daredevil is the first of the Netflix-Marvel allies TV universe which is apart of the Marvel's Cinematic Universe and it is focused in the lesser known marvel characters. They started with Daredevil ,who, after the awful 2003 movie adaptation, wasn't very popular and many believe that these show would be a repeat of the past. They were, as I ,wrong. The show makes justice to the main character and his friends and villains as a whole. Everyone plays his or her role excellent and the drama and pain, they are dealing with, are realist, believable and most of all understandable ,even for the villains. That fact alone justify the high rating of the show because in this way all the characters are depicted as humans ,with strengths,flaws and ideals for the future. I recommend to bring watch it as soon as possible ,with season two just around the corner. (Season 2) well the Devil of hells kitchen did not disappoint and this season we had much more complex story lines and at the last episodes they team of the series took a blood step: they set the stages for event in the future. That could undo the awesomeness of the first season which was in a sense a open an shoot case, but they done it with such a way that in all honesty I want the season 3 NOW!! To the case the new character well close to perfect ,in the case of the Punisher pitch perfect and Jon Bernthal is the definitive Punisher. Finally it took Marvel almost 2 decades (from 1989 Punisher with Dolph Lundgren and the movies in 2004 and 2008), but it finally paid off big time. Also Elektra was 100 times better than her adaptation in 2003 and 2005 ,which everyone wants to forget. All in all I loved season 2 more than 1 and I am unable to wait for the season 3 as well as the Defenders time up.
