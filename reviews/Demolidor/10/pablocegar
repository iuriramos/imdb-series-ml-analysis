Some people say that this TV series has a rating over 9 because of all the fan boys. Well, I was never a fan boy of Daredevil, in fact I didn't even like it! But when I started watching it on Netflix I fell in love with it. The cast is great and I really don't understand why people criticize it so much. It's true it isn't perfect, but you can't expect it to be. 

In my opinion is one of the best creations from Marvel, and it's great because the fact that it's a series instead of a movie, means that we can get more of it than just a couple of hours. Anyway, it's absolutely brilliant, I highly recommend it and I can't wait for more!!!
