Minor spoilers about the character traits, nothing that gives away what happens in the show though. 

I just finished the first season in less than 48 hours after finding out this show even existed and decided to come to rate and let people know what I thought. I won't go into great detail as to what I like, why I like it and rate each actor/actress and so on, because I don't need to. People should just watch this. 

People need to watch it. 

I was gonna rate this show a 9 out of 10, and then I thought to myself "Why am I giving it a 9 instead of a 10?" and I couldn't find a single reason. The main characters are interesting, evolving and just work great together. I love shows/movies with actor that I haven't seen in like 20 different roles. The person acting as the "villain" is so, so awesome. Even the smaller roles are played by great actors and actresses to my uneducated eye.

If I had to mention one thing I liked more than anything else about the show, it would be how human the main character is when he's Daredevil. He makes mistakes, he takes a beating(A LOT!), he has a personal life, he cares, he has bad days and he has a dark side and an inner struggle. 

That's all I'm gonna say. I rate it a perfect 10 and strongly recommend everyone watch it.
