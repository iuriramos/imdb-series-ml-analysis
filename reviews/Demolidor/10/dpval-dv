I've never been much of a comic book reader, except for the old DC books. Loved JLA. Started reading them in 1959. Never read Daredevil. Did not see the movie. My son told me about this series on Netflix so I thought I'd give it a go. Boy am I glad I did. I've seen the first 6 episodes and can't wait to see the rest. I just wish I didn't have to wait so long for the second season. I was a big fan of Charlie Cox for "Boardwalk Empire" and Deborah Ann Woll from "True Blood. Both are great in this series. This show is very, very dark. Don't know what the comic was like, but this show really got to me. Love it....can't wait to see the rest.
