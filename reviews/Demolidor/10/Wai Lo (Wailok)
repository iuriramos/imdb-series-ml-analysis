I'm a HUGE Marvel guy. Since I was a kid, comic books fascinated me. I could loose my self in them. One of the characters that I loved to read about, was DareDevil. When the movie came out a few years back (with the new Batman), I was expecting to see what this TV series has perfectly done, and that is to have great veteran and up-coming actors working with a great scripted comic book adaptation. The action and fighting sequences are not over the top and it has the right amount of special effects. Just enough to make the fantasy elements work. I mean, it's not even fair to compare other comic book TV series (except maybe Arrow) with the job that Marvel and Netflix have done here. And the fact that I can watch all episodes, one after the other makes the experience even better. Can't wait for more DareDevil in the future!
