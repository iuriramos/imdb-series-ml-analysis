So this TV-MA show full of action about a person who got blinded as a kid after saving a old man from getting hit from a car is very different then the movie this show I don't get is great with sexual content makes this action but I get it. It is like i Zombie but i Zombie sends a shiver down your spine and adds more detail showing Liv's visions and how she turned into a zombie and the zombie played by Rose McLever is great. Daredevil is really like i Zombie and you should watch both shows Daredevil season 2 comes out 2016 and i Zombie and still going and new episodes are on at 9/8 Central on CW. Daredevil is my favorite and I am so sad it returns next year.
