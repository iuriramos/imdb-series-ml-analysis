it's dark, gritty and shows no mercy. as a massive comic fan this is everything Daredevil should be. within the first episode it already reaches to an insane level and continues to reach higher, the acting is great and the fight scenes are very entertaining and the story is superb. from a comic guy, what more could you ask for? In this Daredevil series you will explore the depths of who and what Mathew Murdock is and what he stands for as he grips himself into difficult situations and tries to survive as a lone wolf. also, in some of the fight scenes it has some refreshing sequences that you do not usually see in a vigilante or hero TV series.

i recommend this to anyone that is willing to watch it, an absolute fantastic series so far.
