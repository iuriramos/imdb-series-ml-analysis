This new series for Daredevil finally depicts the side we never saw before without the need of reading a comic book to understand the reference. I have said before in my review of the cinematic 2003 movie of "Daredevil" that it should be based on bad directing not bad acting why the movie bombed, but is so not the case with the netflix series "Daredevil". I show no shame in rating this series a 10 out of 10. Marvel finally gives us the "why, and the how"; Matt Murdok is the lawyer that he is. And the subtle backdrop hints of other Marvel characters are even more ear candy for new prospective fans of "Daredevil"
