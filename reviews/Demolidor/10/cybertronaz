I am usually very reserved when it comes to my comic/graphic novel world turned movie or television. I am currently on Episode 4 of season 1 and I must say a round of applause is due. So far it has lived up to my expectations and is playing to the reason why the Man without Fear has always been one of my absolute favorite comic book characters. Charlie Cox should have played in the movie version because he is doing my Daredevil justice. Keep up the good work Marvel, Netflix, you have my vote hands down!!! I also like to stay away from doing character searches or getting ahead of the show to find out who is playing who. As long as the actors and actresses live up to the characters from the book I am generally happy, so far I have no complaints what so ever. Drastic changes from novel to movie/TV show generally will find me looking to watch something else. All I can say is at this point once I made it to the end of episode 3 the have me hooked. So hooked I needed a break only to write this review, get a bowl of cereal, and get back to my custom superhero suede recliner and dig in because I have full intentions on stay up all night now.
