*Written after Season 2*

Marvel's Daredevil is one of, if not, the best shows I have ever seen. The acting, story, direction, action scenes, everything about this show is almost near perfection.

The cast will blow your mind away. Daredevil, Kingpin, Punisher, Elektra, all of them are just amazing at their work. Karen Page, Foggy Nelson, Ben Urich, Stick, I have never seen a show with such perfect cast. The best thing though, is you don't feel left out when you're not watching Daredevil. If it's the Punisher you're watching, Elektra, Karen, Foggy, Kingpin, or anyone else, you just don't miss Matt. Everyone has the potential to take the show upon themselves, and they do an awesome job at it.

The fight scenes are pure fun. If you haven't seen the corridor scene yet, which I bet most of you have, please do. This choreography is better than anything I have seen; it is just too amazing. Elektra kicks ass too, and Punisher is exactly how you imagine him to be in the comics - no one has looked more natural than Jon while walking with a shotgun in a hospital corridor.

The story takes place in Hell's kitchen. There's a lot of suspense element to it, some unexpected things too. The story takes some time to kick in, both in season 1 and 2, but once it does, you want more and more of it.

Overall, Marvel's Daredevil has done justice on Daredevil's character. This show has some flaws just like all others, but it has many less of them. One thing I don't like are the costumes, everyone gets late costumes and shitty ones too, but they improve with time.

If you're a Marvel Fan, watch this. If you're a DC fan, watch this. If you like or hate both, watch this. If you loved or hated the movie, watch this. Just watch this. And I bet, it's worth it.
