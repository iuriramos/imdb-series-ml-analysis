Having just finished binge-watching the show it's safe to say that this is one of the shows that you can not judge over the first few episodes and like many other shows grows to become a masterpiece. 

The storyline in Daredevil is one of the greatest things in the show as it follows the evolution of Daredevil himself alongside the evolution of Nelson and Murdock (Foggy and Matt's business) which is captivating throughout the whole series. Also , Vincent D'Onofrio's portrayal as Kingpin / Wilson Fisk is astonishing and in many places beats Charlie Cox's already amazing portrayal as Matthew Murdock in the series. The fight scenes are also extraordinary and it feels like you are watching something on the big screen not the small screen. 

To conclude , every part of Daredevil is amazing and it really suits it's adult rating despite it being the only media that currently holds the rating in the MCU, the portrayal of many characters is also amazing and like many other people I am waiting patiently for a second series and the next Marvel series on Netflix 'A.K.A. Jessica Jones' . In my opinion , this show is incredibly awesome and binge- watchable and if you haven't already seen it , I would recommend watching it as soon as possible.
