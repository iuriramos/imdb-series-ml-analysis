This series is amazing, why; it's thrilling, in a way very realistic, great dialogue, great character development, great plots(per episode and throughout).. everything is just great..

And let's not forget about the action.. especially the last 5 minutes of the second episode contains one of the best fight scenes I've seen(and yes I've seen raid 2). It was just a 5 minute long fight scene in one take(take that in) and it was so well choreographed.. well put together.. every actor was on point and knew how to move.. 

This whole series is just well put together.. and we kind of expect it now from netflix-series.. house of cards for example.. 

Now i've heard that they had about 66 million for this whole season to spend, which shows.. cause every episode is so well filmed.. when cgi is needed(which comes down to almost 0) it's well done.. the fight scenes well choreographed, the accting is just superb and the lighting.. the angles everything is just perfect..

Im just gonna say it; This series is AS entertaining AS Breaking Bad.. yup I just said it..

10/10.. seriously.. 10 out of 10..
