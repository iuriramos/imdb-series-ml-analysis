Once I heard Daredevil was joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I was excited. The Man Without Fear was finally getting a great adaptation. I'm so happy that I got to watch this brilliant entry to the MCU. Everything about the show is amazing.

I loved the series' dark tone. It captured the feel of Frank Millar's run of Daredevil comics perfectly. The cast is great as well. The stand- out actors so far are Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio as Matt Murdock/Daredevil and Wilson Fisk/Kingpin respectively. Both actors were amazing. Some of the other actors didn't really impress me at all like Elden Henson and Deborah Ann Woll.

The best part of the show is the fight choreography. It came off as real and grounded. The story was engaging as well. It kept my attention though out the first season. I have to say that the Netflix Daredevil show is one of the best comic book shows that I have watched in years. Now, I'm excited to see the rest of the MCU/Netflix shows. I will be so happy to add Netflix's Daredevil to my movie/TV show collection.
