If you don't have Netflix, get it now, just to watch this show. If you watch this show, it might be you're favorite show, it is excellent. Though it is very very bloody, examples of the gore; decapitation limbs cut off and much more.

The fight scenes are intense and once again very bloody. I like how daredevil's suit (costume) evolves slowly and his weapons. The actors and actresses play the characters. They explained the characters past perfectly, they explained Wilson Fisk's past very traumatizing.

I liked how they introduced each character slowly and explain very well how they met. I liked how Vincent D'Onofrio played Wilson Fisk. The mysteries they put to keep you tuned in for the next episode is amazing. 

This is a must watch, it is the perfect show for a adult superhero show...
