I'm totally blown away with this adaptation. The Story, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Russians, the sidekick, their stories, the fight scenes and parkour, Fisk, the whole being a superhero but still get your ass kicked thing,... and Bokeh (Seriously, every shot in this show had Bokeh in the background) There was not one single shot or story which I (These things are always subjective) found unnecessary.

The only downside to this show is that it was released in one day. It has one of the best hooks on 3 or 4 Episodes I have ever seen. One can not just stop watching an Episode and leave. After the third Episode you fall into this loophole, where the only Exit is watching all 13 Episodes, and being "forced" to wait another year.

But bravo to all the actors and the director for making history with this. That said, I hate them all for making me wait a whole year for more

To cut this short though: If you're into superheroes, watch this. And if you're not, go watch this. This isn't a typical Superhero Movie that you "want" to miss
