I am not exactly a fan of Arrow, Gotham or flash. I think super hero TV series's these days, lack a lot of maturity. I was expecting to the same disappointment when i gave Dare Devil a chance, but surprisingly it was pretty good. I absolutely love the overall dark theme of the series. The lines used by the characters aren't all that clich√© either. The script seems really good. Its not just mindless action, there seems to be a well organized plot. The actors, I'm quite happy with them, they will surely improve and blend more with their character in the seasons to come. I love the drama between Foggy and Matt already! Overall i think its brilliant, I did not feel fifty minutes pass by when i watched the first episode. If you look for logic and a story along with action, i believe this is the super Hero TV series you have been waiting for.
