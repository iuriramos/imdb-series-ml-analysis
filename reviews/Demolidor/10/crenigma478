As a fan of All Comic Boooks for nearly 40 years, I was extremely excited when Netflix began Daredevil. I LOVED the first season particularly because of the way both Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk were portrayed. Finally, it was the Murdock and Fisk that I had grown up with! Then came Jessica Jones. A lower tier Marvel Character who is now on the A List, thanks to a stellar First Season!

Now comes the Second Season of Daredevil and it is the best yet. It is not a spoiler to say that the second season includes Elektra and The Punisher. Elodie Yung plays Elektra perfectly, hitting every level of pathos. Brutal and Dangerous when it is called for but under the surface is a heroic and even sympathetic warrior. John Bernthal brings to Frank Castle aka The Punisher, what always should have been there. Rage, with a heroism buried beneath. Forget Thomas Jane or even Ray Stevenson (who gave his best to what he was given), finally we have The defining Punisher!

I can't say enough about the other stand out performances..but once again Matt, Foggy, and Karen are pitch perfect. The twist at the end of Episode 8 will blow you away, and the verbal confrontation between two characters in Episode 10 is Emmy Worthy!! If I had but one complaint it would be lighting. When Daredevil is fighting battles at night, i'd like to be able to actually see them! This was a problem in Season 1 as well..but it is minor when balanced with the overall quality of the show! Bring on The Defenders..because The Man Without Fear is more than ready!! Season 2 of Daredevil brings the comics to life and is the best TV offering Marvel has given us yet!
