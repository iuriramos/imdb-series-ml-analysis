When i first saw who marvel cast as Daredevil, i lost all hope of it being better than the 2003 movie.(which i loved back then and still do)but as soon as the first trailer was out. I realized how mistaken i was and couldn't wait for it to be released. And NOW I LOVE IT. The directing, the acting, the story Its all TOP NOTCH i love how they balanced his Matt Murdock persona as a lawyer and as a vigilante.Even the supporting characters were all handled pretty greatly. Vincent was born to play Wilson Fisk. The show had the best fighting sequences I've seen in any superhero show. And the fact that its bloody and gory makes it even better. Marvels Daredevil is a MUST WATCH
