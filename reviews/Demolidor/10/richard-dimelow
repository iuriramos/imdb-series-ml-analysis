Just finished watching Daredevil on Netflix, what can you say, top acting by all, including Charlie Cox and Deborah Ann Woll but special praise goes to Vincent D'Onofrio for his portrayal of Wilson Fisk. Its not very often a villain is played as well as this, in my view up there with Heath Ledger. The back story of Daredevil and his learning curve into turning into the character is fantastic and not one episode is a let down. The current Golden Age of Marvel and DC series is a joy to behold and with the advent of all the new films coming out the time is now to be into superheroes. Well done to all on the show, gritty and realistic.
