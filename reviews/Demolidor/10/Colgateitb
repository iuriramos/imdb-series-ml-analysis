Might contain spoilers?This show does everything right!The acting is excellent,the action is excellent,the characters are awesome(especially the Punisher,that guy is ****ing awesome!)and the villain of the first season(Wilson Fisk)is not just some clich√©d evil guy who likes to do evil stuff etc.,you actually understand why the guy is doing the stuff he is doing.There is an entire episode about his childhood which was great because they really showed what the guy has been through(great job Marvel).Not to say that you want the guy to win or something,but at the same time you kinda feel sorry for him and just want him to die.Also excellent is the chemistry between Foggy,Karen and Matt,they are just so funny and all cute together.Great show!Thank you Marvel!
