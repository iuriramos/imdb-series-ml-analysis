This is by far one of the best series I've seen in recent memory (binging wise). And definitely a a toss up for best netflix original alongside bloodline. Jessica Jones made me appreciate it even more. It's up there with Batman the Darknight. It's as if Nolan directed this series. Finally a superhero series for adults! You can literally feel every packed punch. I was sold in the first episode at the realism of the character unlike the movies character starring Affleck. This Daredevil gets his butt kicked and kicked. It's dark very dark and oh so violent

There are so many incredible fight scenes; the hallway one to name a few. Great shots; when he's sitting in the back of the cab. This series is literally a masterpiece. I can't imagine anyone having not seen this yet but if not your extremely lucky because now you have 13 episodes to devour. Don't be like me and consume them at once and because you will no doubt be depressed that feeling of no show can possibly match 13 hours of what I just witnessed. Savior this it's pure uncut gold. Enjoy
