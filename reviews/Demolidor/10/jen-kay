Wow wow wow. I just had to say I found this series amazing. Words can't express how much I enjoyed every episode. I watched every episode over 2 days even though I had an eye operation on Monday (20th April) I couldn't wait to watch the next episode. The main villain Wilson Fisk played by Vincent D'Onofrio was very good, I got to dislike him totally. Matt Murdock played by Charlie Cox had super powers that were not over the top and believable.

I am not really into beat them up violence however I was actually shouting out loud at my laptop for the hero Matt Murdock (Daredevil) to kill the villains, and I was cheering and clapping when he succeeded. My dog Bailey was looking at me as if I was crazy (he might be right).

I hope there is a second season because I definitely will be watching it.

This is my first review here as I have never watched anything before that I could be bother to make any comments about.

Well done to everyone involved in making this series.
