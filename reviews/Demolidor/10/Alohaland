After looking at the criticisms on message board, I felt compelled to write this review. I'm 62 years old and grew up reading Marvel comics. I've also watched the evolution of Marvel and other graphic novels as they were made into movies. I grew up in a family of film makers (Great Grandfather, Ford Beebe, did original Flash Gordon serial and many western and jungle serials. Grandfather & Father worked for Disney. With an eye for movie making cultivated by critical assessment of over 50 years, I think that this Daredevil series is one of the best I've seen! Top notch! Can't help but wonder if criticisms are from a generation may not have read the original comics and think that "Twilight" is quality entertainment. Keep Daredevil coming!!!
