I'm not one for reading Comic Books or do I have any interest in seeing them come to life, like so many Hollywood Movies these days. With that said, Netflix' Daredevil is an amazing series!

There were some lagging parts however, the story needs to be told. I can say it was worth the wait for the last 15 minutes of Season 13!

The dialog for me was very believable, I felt like this could have really happened in everyday life. Maybe this was why I was sucked into a comic book characters life. There was nothing really to me that felt far fetched or couldn't happen. 

The casting of characters was excellent! Job well done!

I hope there will be more!
