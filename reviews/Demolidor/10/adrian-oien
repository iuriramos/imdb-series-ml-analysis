Being used to the humor in Marvel movies like Iron Man and Avengers, I found myself surprised to see Marvels answer to DC's Watchmen, the darkest and bloodiest "superhero" movie I know of. And how did Daredevil do? Let me tell you. This weekend has been a roller-coaster, barely any breaks between every movie-like episode of this dark, gritty, violent and bloody Marvel Show. You don't even have to be a superhero or comic-book fan, all you need is to appreciate well written characters, great atmosphere as well as nearly perfect plot and choreographed fight scenes. This is exactly what I've wanted from Marvel in a long, long time. Also, if you like Arrow and/or Flash, this will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. There is no question, Marvel's Daredevil is my new favorite TV show based on a comic book. Watch it, you won't regret it.
