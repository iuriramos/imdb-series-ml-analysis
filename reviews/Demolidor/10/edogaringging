Spent my whole night, which I previously planned to go out with some folks, to watch some episodes of this. I have never really seen Daredevil as cool as how he is being portrayed in this series. I know that the comic book has always been dark and gritty, but with the effects they added to each scene, I feel just like trapped and cannot stop watching. The acting is well, I don't know how to put it, but I feel like I was watching real people doing real stuffs. The action scenes are awesome (I am not gonna say that it is as real as the lawyer acting). I have never even batted an eye to Daredevil before today (moreover after that previous movie), but I assure you, I will have his poster on my wall tomorrow.
