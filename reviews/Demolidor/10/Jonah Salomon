Amazing. Downright amazing. The cinematography, story, acting and script were just stunning. This is now on my top 3 shows of all time. I was pleasantly surprised with everything about this show. I was prepared for a lot of things, however, what I was not prepared was to FALL IN LOVE with these characters. Not only the main character is a hero, but so are their friends, so are their neighbors. They villain is evil, but has good intentions...In a extremely disturbing and violent way. The good guys are brave, and terrified, and so very flawed. The good guys make mistakes. Men cry, women save themselves. The characters are totally believable. Unlike most MARVEL movies (I probably just annoyed all the fan boys didn't I). Ultimately, what I am talking about is good writing. This is an amazing show because it has great actors, amazing writers and some incredible stunts. To make it all better, their cinematography is JUST STUNNING! Watch it. It's ultra dark and ultra violent. It'll make you care. You won't be sorry. It has a lot of talented people working on it. Watch it and find out why the world has gone crazy for Daredevil.
