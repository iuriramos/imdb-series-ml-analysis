I have been able to watch six episodes so far and I am enjoying the series immensely as I remember the first twelve or so comics when Daredevil was introduced as a member of the Marvel universe many years ago. This series has some exceptional actors in all the roles and all play their parts with commitment and none more so than that of Fisk. 

Daredevil is also very well played with remarkable believability as a blind person with hyper developed but very human senses and although extraordinary, not super human. Very well photographed as well so the presentation of the whole series pulls you in to their universe fully and completely. 

Although it will not appeal to everyone perhaps as too violent or to unbelievable, I personally enjoy the feeling of putting real life aside for a few hours, sitting back, relaxing and entering another world with a detailed story to follow along to. Very well done in my honest opinion.
