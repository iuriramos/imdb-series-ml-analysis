I was really hesitant about watching "Daredevil" at first, but thanks to my sister who talked me into it, I absolutely love it! For those who are Marvel fans, this show is the real deal. It's dark and gritty but at the same time very entertaining! Charlie Cox did a really great job as the blind lawyer turned kick-ass vigilante. I don't think I will take him seriously in any other roles in shows/movies anymore! Based on its TV-MA rating, Daredevil is pretty clean with mild language and no explicit content (except for the mature themes that deal with drugs and human trafficking). It's the violence that is pretty strong with lots of blood splatters, fights, bones breaking and disturbing noises that you will have you take a moment to recover. "Daredevil" is not suitable for younger viewers under 13, so parents watch this show at night!
