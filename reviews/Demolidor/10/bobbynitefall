WTF??? This is probably the best "superhero" show I've ever seen. Well written, well filmed, well acted. Plus, Rosario Dawson is in it and she's one of the most beautiful women of her generation. Then add Deborah Ann Woll who, I wish she was red headed still, is probably equally beautiful. Both actresses are amazingly good at their craft. Even the young version of Murdock is really strong. I can not come up with any complaints and I'm a really hard to please old curmudgeon. I hope they make more episodes next season because this is hardly a binge viewed show. Gimme more. Gimme more, Gimme more. Stupid IMDb demands more lines or they will not post. Line line line line line
