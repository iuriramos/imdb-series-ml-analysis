First of i have to admit i had really high hopes from this show and when it comes from such a power house of MARVEL you should be. Well turns out MARVEL can and has delivered for what we all have been waiting for, this drama shows us that how violent ,corrupt ,brooding and dark life can be around someone and that one man can surely make a difference whether it's from within or without the boundaries of law. The main attraction of the show is that its mature . Its surely not suitable for children but targeted at adults with all the blood and gore and the political undertones it has. the show really fleshes out the characters, both the protagonist and the antagonist. Charlie cox and Vincent donofrio has really made a solid impression on me .The kingpin of crime shines in his full glory in this show and donofrio has made it more realistic and complex as the story progresses.Vincent donofrio was born for this role as he makes it worthwhile to root for the bad guy even for someone like the ruthless and cruel as Wilson FISK. Some other side characters such as foggy gives us the comedic relief and Ben Urich ,Rosario Dawson, Bob Gunton and Wesley gives us some really power packed performances . The fight scenes are realistic and excellently done, the plot unravels gradually but takes a hold of you and Charlie cox shines as the DEVIL in these awesome show .If the future TV shows are like these from MARVEL then i am even ready for a movie. one thing for sure that Punisher, Moon knight and other street level heroes deserves to be on netflix at least as supporting characters.
