The writing of this show is outstanding. I was waiting on some slippage on the second season and it disappointed me.

The second season was just as great as the first if not better.

If we can get a Batman series like this, or a whole Marvel or D.C.

universe, this would take comics books to a whole new level.

I have seen Punisher twice before on Silver screen, nothing like this.

I was like a kid in the 80's reading comic books when I seen him this time.

The Punisher is raw fire power and no remorse.

Elektra, when I think of the 2003 Daredevil, I though instant failure. Boy was I wrong!

Already waiting on the 3rd season.
