I love this series! Having watched seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix in a fairly quick space of time (about 1 month) how I've grown to love the introduction with the creepy graphics and the music you can't get out of your head. The acting is amazing and the characters really seem real and their stories engrossing. Foggy is brilliant, so is Matt of course and Karen is brilliant too.

The fighting is also amazing but I love the way Daredevil (Matt) is like an ordinary guy. He doesn't seem really big or muscly and you can certainly feel the pain when he gets hit.

What a great story and a great series. I can't believe they're not making series 3 for some time now! Keep it going Netflix!!
