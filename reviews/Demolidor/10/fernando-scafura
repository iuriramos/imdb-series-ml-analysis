Daredevil is a simply the best work Marvel has done up to this point. First of all the tone is set right with the choice of colors and the cinematography. The dark and shadowy scenes reflect the overall duality (light-dark) while also transmitting tension and drama much like a baroque work of art. The acting is superb; everyone feels right in their role.

The show brings a sense of reality not common in superhero stories (Daredevil takes a lot of beating and bleeds constantly!); even DD's costume is at first raw and simple. One can relate to the environment of an entangled corruption within every aspect of ordinary life and that feeling of helplessness in face of it. It kind of reminds me of "Tropa de Elite" (Elite Squad, 2007) on this aspect. 

Therefore, in such a place, how can one distinguish right and wrong? It is a blurry line. Up to what point are Matthew Murdoch's actions justified? Is it right to do wrong in order to set things right? Whom are laws made for? What makes one evil or good? These are the main questions the show asks - and the same questions humankind has always debated. 

The differences (and similarities) between Wilson Fisk and Matthew Murdoch summarize all this, since both seem to be aiming for the same goal - saving Hell's Kitchen -, although in significantly different ways. The debates/confessions of Murdock with Father Lantom are the best scenes to confront this ambiguity; Matthew is conflicted and deep down he knows that what he does is not entirely correct, good, nor right. But what other choice does he have? In a world like this, maybe it is the only way, to take justice with your own hands.

Finally, Matthew's speech on court sums up everything:

"I've been preoccupied of late with, uh, questions of morality. Of right and wrong, good and evil. Sometimes the delineation between the two is a sharp line. Sometimes it's a blur, and often it's like pornography: you just know when you see it."
