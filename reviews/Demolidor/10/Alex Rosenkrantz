Everything is too perfect. Not only is every single part of the production done extremely well, they all coalesce synergizing it into product that is evermore exquisite, breathtaking, hysterical, inspiring, and even contemplative of ageless questions of morality, justice, and duty.

The script, the casting, the action scenes, the relationships, the origin and back story, the dialog, the acting, everything is done exquisitely. After watching a few episodes, I get the feeling like everyone involved in the entire production is really pouring everything they have into it. 

I truly hope that everyone is honorably recognized for all their hardwork, dedication, and talent. Needless to say I also desperately hope that following seasons will be given to continue documenting their continued achievement and excellence.
