Outstanding! Simply outstanding! This show is like a love letter to the fans of the comic book and a complete and utter redemption for that Ben Affleck train wreck of a film that we, the die-hard Daredevil fans, were forced to endure. I couldn't be happier nor more surprised. The show is dark and edgy, pitting our beloved hero against a grim, unforgiving vision of New York City. It is simply light years ahead of anything I've come to expect (rather unfortunately) from the majority of Marvel's movie or TV adaptations. My sincerest thanks and kudos to all those involved. A total home run! You'd have to be blind not to see how great this show is! And to anyone who gave this show anything less than an 8 or 9, it's clear you're not a true fan of the comic. O.K. I'm done gushing now.
