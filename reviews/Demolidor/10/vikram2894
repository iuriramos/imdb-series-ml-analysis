The way the director have conveyed each scene is just amazing! The screenplay, performance of all the cast, locations are perfect throughout. Choreography displays the best realistic fight that anybody would have ever seen in any movies or series!!! The way the story is conveyed is brilliant!! After I finished watching season 2, the worst feeling is to wait for another year for season 3 :( Way to go team Daredevil!!! The end of the season 2 has triggered lot of curiosity! Yet another great work by Marvel. Although the wait for 1 year is worth it, It would be great to watch it often. Thank you for giving such a great series!!
