Daredevil season 1 is about Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer but at night he's fights crime with his other senses. When I first heard Netflix was doing a Marvel show. I thought it could go very bad or very good and I'm glad to say it went fantastic. Everything that happened in daredevil was so prefect. From the acting to the action scenes. First the acting was amazing by everyone. first look at Charlie Cox(Matt Murdock) he doesn't seem like a good fit for the role but he's plays the role so great. Not a single character was bad. While he was great it was his antagonist Wilson Fisk played Vincent D'Onofrio who knocked it out of the park. He is marvel's best villain yet. He's actually a real threat to our hero. Now the action. Every single action scene was done you perfect, it reminds me of the movie the raid. Overall Daredevil season 1 was perfect, not a single bad character or a bad episode. If you haven't started this show, you should definitely start it. There's also lots of Easter eggs to the marvel movies.
