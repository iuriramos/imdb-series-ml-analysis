I do not write reviews, I don't think I have ever written one before. There is not much I care strongly enough about to put my opinion out there. Daredevil is good enough to break my 21 year silence. The pacing is spectacular, the twists are truly surprising, and the writing, and the acting, and the costume designers, etc. are fantastic. I had never read the comic books, as with many of Marvels recent ventures, but this absolutely makes me want to.

I have heard people calling it Marvels version of the Dark Knight. In tone and aesthetics it does hold many similarities. The dark atmosphere and gore are a 180 to the films that marvel has recently produced. It is a different version of marvel, that those who follow the pop culture of Marvel have not yet seen. And it is done with as much spectacular commitment and soul as what we have come to expect from Marvel. It is fantastic and I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes superheroes, action, or good shows.
