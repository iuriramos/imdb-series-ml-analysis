As a Child i always liked the DD character, But after watching the DD(2005) movie i tried so hard to like it but its a disaster. I had no interest in watching the TV show but after watching House of cards S03 i wanted to give a try for it Watched 1 episode and i'm amazed. This is how Dare Devil should be! Completed S01 in two days waiting for S02. Amazing Cast Good Acting Good Dialogues and soundtrack too .. Just WOW!! kindly disappointed with the suit though very little. Have faith n netflix wish they wont let the show down in the next seasons like every other superhero shows, please don't. FOR THOSE WHO SEARCH FOR USER REVIEWS TO WATCH THE SHOW .. THOIS IS IT! Awesome Show watch it you won' be disappointed.
