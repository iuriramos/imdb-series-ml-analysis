Marvels Daredevil... where to begin, amazing writing, amazing tone, amazing character development and a very well done story. I would say it is the best superhero show out right now. Season 1 was very good, with an amazing villain and great characters BUT SEASON 2 ... WOW it was amazing, now a lot of people say that season 1 was still better, the tones for both seasons are much different and the story lines as well because of the characters season 2 introduces. Jon Bernthal as Punisher... amazing, such a well done character. I could truly feel what Frank was going through. I would say the the weakest part of the season which wasn't bad it was good was Electra's story, while Electra was portrayed really well, I felt like her story and connection to daredevil's main story was a little off, but this season was amazing despite that. Action scenes were amazing, character development was very good through out the season. Whether you like superheroes or not this show is a must watch.
