Without a doubt this is the best superhero show out there quite simply because it takes a page out of Nolan's Dark Knight series. Conceptually the idea is similar to that of the Dark Knight series, that there is a city that needs saving, a city that needs a hero but that hero needs to be whatever the city needs him to be. Sometimes he is a savior and sometimes a menace who has to be stopped. It is a very gritty and dark take on the superhero genre and I am happy that this path has been taken. My only concern is that the series should not follow the tried and tested formula, the one edict that most superheroes follow which is that they don't seek justice by killing but by trusting in the law. In the real world, corruption is very real and sometimes trusting in the law is not an option. I wish that the tone that this series took in the beginning where our protagonist seeks retribution through not killing but beating and maiming, and sometimes taking the law into his own hands; this is what is the need of the hour for him to be able to fight back. What one of the villains - Vladimir says in one of the episodes that when you put on a mask you become an animal and with animals there can only be one survivor for it is always survival of the fittest. Therefore to stop the main villain - Wilson Fisk, the Daredevil will have to do more than just bring him to justice by subjecting him to a fair trial. It is obvious that he will have to end him. And end whatever it is that stands between him and the kingpin. That is how the series should conclude. Otherwise it will just be the Dark knight series with a blind batman. All said and done, this is a very gritty and befitting treatment to the Daredevil franchise. Lets hope it continues in the same vein.
