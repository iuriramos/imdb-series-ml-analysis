Hopefully we can all forget about the afleck daredevil now, because this TV show is seriously good. As mentioned in my title it incorporates all the aspects that make TV shows such a great entertainment medium. Every character has their own story that develops nicely, no character ends the show the same way they started. The action is very brutal and quick (the corridor scene was one of the best long takes I've seen, second only to the Raid and the Raid 2), but done well, with daredevil getting enough beatings that you feel like he's learning on the job and actually a mortal human being rather than a super human with no chance of getting damaged. I like the realism of him being out of action for a couple of episodes because he gets the crap so badly kicked out of him, kudos to the writers and director for doing that. The villain is superb, not some person who is indescribably evil for no reason, in fact in many episodes they do very well in making you go "you know I could agree with this guy, and get behind him, if daredevil wasn't such a badass". He makes some of the best monologues I have heard in television, that work in giving you an insight into his point of view and motivations and self perception, but also lead to add to the tension of the scene as it gets more and more sinister. Overall not a classic children's MCU character. So maybbeeee don't watch with your little kiddy winks, but a great TV show to get far too engrossed in and watch in a weekend, then pester all your friends to watch. PROS -Great plot -Great Character development -Great action -Visually beautiful -Realistically brutal

CONS -NEEDS MORE EPISODES -Some dialogue is a bit slow (but always worth it)
