I have never seen something so excellent on the small screen, while it is marvel and takes place in the same universe as 'The Avengers' it is much more gory and much more dark than the films. The fight scenes are spectacular and it really redeemed daredevils character after 2003's atrocity. I highly recommend this to anyone weather you're a comic fan, movie fan or have never seen anything and never showed an interest in Marvel. My one complaint is that it took 13 episodes for daredevil to get his classic outfit (that's the whole series and he only ad it while he took down kingpin). Vincent D'Onofrio's portrayal of Wilson Fisk (kingpin) was absolutely spot on and Charlie Cox is perfect for Matt Murdock, i don't think they could have chosen better actors.
