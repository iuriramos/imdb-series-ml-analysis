I am hooked! After the Ben Affleck Daredevil (2003) movie disappointment, this show is truly refreshing and brings back the fate that comic book heroes can come to life in a good, convincing way. This show is better than I expected. Realistic enough, good actors, Charlie Cox is perfect for the lead role, Elden Henson is cute and funny, it was nice watching Deborah Ann Woll after True Blood, as a normal person and not a vampire and Vincent D'Onofrio after Law and Order. Great sound and sound design and a smart use of surround sound where it's needed and not just to use it for no reason. Smart little tweaks which impacts the visuals greatly. Netflix have done it again, I hope to see more of their adaptations to Marvel's heroes. In short, watch it, you'll like it.
