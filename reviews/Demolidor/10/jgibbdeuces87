This is what fans had in mind when Ben Affleck helped destroy the movie(BTW good luck to Batman V Superman. With Ben Affleck filling in for Christian Bale as Batman that could be disastrous) . Everything about this Netflix show makes the movie an afterthought andbmakes this the best comic book screen adaptation period. The acting is great and you can't help but become enthralled by the amount of action and personal struggles Matt Murdock goes through on the path to becoming Daredevil against Wilson Fisk. A great telling of the story from Bendis and Frank Miller's epic Marvel Comics miniseries'Daredevil:The Man Without Fear'. Can't wait to see the second season. Jon Bernthal from The Walking Dead (Shane) is cast as The Punisher. Can't see anyone else playing The Punisher like Tom Jane yet. He WAS The Punisher so I hope Jon Bernthal lives up to the legend!
