I give this show 10 out of 10 because for me it's got everything in it! The show makes you laugh, cry, smile and make you feel that you are part of that world. It's so entertaining and although the story is based on comic books it feels so real! The actors have done a fantastic job playing their characters and it's clear that they have worked hard and prepared for their roles. 

All the actors have contributed to the success of the show but for me Charlie cox has played the biggest part in this . He is seriously talented and the reason why I am so keen for season three to come out This is well worth a watch!
