Much like the X-Men in the 1960s, Daredevil wasn't as popular as he was today. However, that all changed when a young artist named Frank Miller began penciling him for Roger Mckenzie in 1979. Most of Mckenzie's stories are good, but when Miller starts writing the stories they're even better. No disrespect to Mckenzie, I respect him as a writer I just prefer Miller's style of storytelling. Roger wrote the stories from issues 158-166, and David Michilienie's stand-alone story issue 167 which I also enjoyed. Then we get the classic Miller stories from there, starting with Elektra's first appearance, to establishing Kingpin as a primary antagonist to Daredevil, and last but not least some classic fights with Bullseye. Overall, I believe any Daredevil fan should own Miller's run on the character it's dark, gritty, and at times realistic. Miller did a great job on revitalizing the character; despite not seeing himself as the series savior. From this whole volume my favorite story has to be issue 169, I'm not going to spoil it just read it. This is the beginning definitive run on Daredevil, so what are you waiting for buy it already.
