I'm a hardcore Marvels fan and I've been watching everything that's been released from Marvel and Co. and I must say that 'Daredevil' is probably their best work yet (series wise).

I've watched two episodes and its awesome. Simply because, there is no beating around the bush. It is what it is. No special weapons vault, no special secret lair, no special organic secret blue-tooth wifi wireless ear dongle weapon. Just action and some occasional small talk haha.

Unlike Agents of Shield, Agent Carter etc etc this is in a class of it's own. From the very first episode, there's hardcore action, an awesome script, excellent camera work, no cheesy one liners and no corny references. It's simply 'boots to asses' and a cackle in between.

Really really worth a watch. Excellent, I love it.

Well-done Netflix and Marvel, you have a winner.
