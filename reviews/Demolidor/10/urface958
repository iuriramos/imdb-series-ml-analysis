They finally did it right because after the daredevil from 2003 with Ben Affleck it completely destroyed daredevil for me and when I heard that NETFLIX was doing a TV show I didn't really care and I didn't want to watch it until I saw the trailer. The trailer gave me so many chills and goosebumps that it had forced me to watch it. So I watched the pilot and it was absolutely incredible. Before I knew it all 13 episodes were done and I was sitting down on my couch wondering what I was gonna do now. All I could think was that it was just phenomenal and that I hope season 2 comes out. They chose the backstory right with Matt being a hero instead of a crybaby skateboarder and the fact that he was trained by someone else and not him self makes more sense. The villain was chosen better, don't get me wrong I like bullseye but I don't think it's perfect for a first instalment, instead they used Kingpin which this time he is named Wilson Fisk. The action sequences to the long scenes with Matt talking to the priest it was absolutely perfect this time.
