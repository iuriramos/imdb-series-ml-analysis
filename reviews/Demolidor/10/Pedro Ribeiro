Vincent D'Onofrio (The Crime King) acting is so terrible! I really hate his acting on this role, his emotions, facial expressions, his voice and moves are so lost, it's like he doesn't know how to get it the role of the character... 

Cool part is that he looks a lot like the guy on the comics, with the whole "large guy" and bald thing, but his acting is so bad. I can't believe it, for real, every scene it disappoints me; what a huge mistake giving him this role.

On the other side, the rest of the series are so awesome, that they outweigh Vincent's bad acting; the great part is that the main character really have some tuff fights, it's not like he is a super duper untouchable hero, he really works himself to get fights won! 

The story is also very nice! The unwind of the episodes are really nice and the main actor is brilliant.
