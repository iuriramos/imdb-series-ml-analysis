Two episodes in so far, as a Daredevil fan it's exactly what I hoped for. I am a huge fan of the Daredevil comics, my favourite run being by Bendis and Maleev, and this show is how you would imagine a Daredevil TV show being. It's a dark, gritty sombre affair with some great action, there is a fight scene in episode two which is truly amazing.

Talking about action the best part for me is the action feels very realistic and brutal unlike the Daredevil film with its over the top wire work. Also very good in this show is the way his powers aren't shown in any fancy way, no sonar view or anything like that, it just emphasise his listening. The actors are all great too and the plots are compelling, just now I have nothing bad to say about this show.

When marvel got back the rights to Daredevil I was a little apprehensive of how they would portray his character, no worries there now I've seen it, or if they would use the character at all. I was worried if he did get his own show/film it'd be like the rest of the Marvel films/shows, light hearted action with great fan service and a good helping of comedic moments, which wouldn't of suited the dark world of Daredevil. But I can safely say to all you fellow hornhead fans that they have nailed everything about Daredevil perfectly.

I would highly recommend this show to Daredevil fans and fans of darker heroes like Batman, fans of the current MCU films/shows might not like the tonal change from those films/shows but it's exactly what the character needed. Now excuse me while I go watch some more! 10/10
