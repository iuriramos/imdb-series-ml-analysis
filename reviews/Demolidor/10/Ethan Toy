To start, this is a brilliant scripted show with great dialogue and acting. The fight scenes are intense, the drama is real, and Hell's Kitchen never felt more realistic. Within the very first episode of this show, I was hooked and lead into a world of crime and realism. Surprisingly, it works really well- scratch that, AMAZINGLY well. I'm a huge fan-boy of Marvel's Cinematic Universe which gives me another reason to truly emerge myself into this world of Daredevil. It's brilliantly executed with great cinematography and choreography that just works! It's a great add-on in Marvel's Cinematic Universe and crazily enough: this is one hell of a grim show. It's not afraid to bare his teeth and show some disturbing things that audiences will be surprised to see. Whether it'd be language or violence- you can tell Marvel is repaying the fans for its disgusting 2003 film that just didn't deserve the name Daredevil. But now here I am, talking about a SHOW; a show with episodes and seasons, not films. It comes to show that this show does exceedingly well in terms of heroes and vigilantes. This is a great show with great plot and script. You shouldn't miss this for the world. It is quite frankly one of the best (if not best) hero shows to watch right now. So get cracking on Netflix and put yourself in a ride that'll take you on a journey through the eyes of Daredevil!
