I was a little apprehensive of Daredevil series before. Unlike Arrow and Flash, Daredevil was a little less captivating as a comic book here for me. Afterall, Daredevil hadn't got his power because of nuclear reaction, genetic make-up nor he was a filthy rich playboy. Then, I watched 5 minutes of the pilot episode and I couldn't move an eyelid till I saw the final one. It is beautifully written, the cast is amazing and everything falls perfectly into place. What I love the most is the fact that Marvel has put every details into making Matthew's story very real. He comes across more convincing vigilante than others present on the scene, the fact that he gets a suit in 13th Episode shows that true vigilantes are not just born out of the engineering room.
