Ben Affleck's performance in 2003 left a mark and unfortunately, it was a big scar. Forgotten in time for over 12 years Marvel announced a TV-Series consisted of 13 Episodes and the delivery boy was, Neftlix. Everyone including me, was going crazy when they heard about it, especially when they found out about the duration of every episode, which is an a hour. Later one they officially released Daredevil. I was left speechless. I had never seen such an amazing interpretation of this character before(like there were many). Season 2 came in and things got hotter and hotter, both literally and metaphorically. I mean Come on, who didn't like the Punisher or Elektra? The Hand, on the other hand(get it?) was phenomenal, great finale(Season 2) when it comes in getting their asses beaten up. Oh and I almost forgot, the choreography was bloody amazing! I don't want to say anything about the choreography of this series due to the fact that it's one of the most interesting and beautiful thing you'll observe.
