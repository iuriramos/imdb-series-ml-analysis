When I first saw the ads, I was like... what a stupid looking costume! It resembles the Daredevil costume from The Incredible Hulk TV movie! But as I continued to watch, it became quickly apparent to me that the costume was a side issue to the excellent story lines and the great acting. I felt that every actor was carefully chosen for their role. I loved every character. I can't say the same about any other superhero movie or TV show. There's usually someone I feel was miscast. I found myself watching each episode and wanting to learn more about each character and how he or she fits into the Daredevil universe. Big kudos to Vincent Donofrio for his portrayal of The Kingpin. I didn't think he could pull it off at first. I love Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock and the actor who played Foggy was great, too. I'm just totally in love with the series and anxiously awaiting the second season! Oh, I think the red Daredevil costume was a little hokey-looking, but I didn't care because the story was so great. Kudos to the writers!
