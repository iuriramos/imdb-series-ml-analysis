well i enjoyed the first series so much the film that came out years ago didn't do it justice has so much action doesn't lack story line enjoyed all 13 episodes.

so wen i saw season 2 had came out couldn't wait to watch it well i have now finished all 13 episodes and can safely say for those who enjoyed the first u will defiantly love this its got everything u need in a good series it doesn't over step that boundary of bringing silliness like other series iv watched.

the twists and turns giving it a very fresh feel but keeping its appeal I'm now eagerly waiting for season 3 

watch it and give it a go ....
