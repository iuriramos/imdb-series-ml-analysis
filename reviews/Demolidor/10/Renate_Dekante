First of all, big fan of Marvel comics and shows! Daredevil (in my opinion) has one of the best story lines. I was very scared to see it brought back to life after the big failure of 2002 movie and yes also the fact that Netflix took the initiative. And now I can say, I'm extremely thankful they did. The first teaser already gave me major hopes for the show and they certainly paid off. To not spoil the main actions of the series, I was positively astonished that there was no "character shipping" and the main focus was on the character essence. The actors, the screenplay, the music and most importantly the action scenes, all made this show so likable. A must watch!

They better make season 2 or else...
