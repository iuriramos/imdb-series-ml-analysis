They got everything right, the story is captivating and the action sucks you in!

I loved that they focused on making a great crime/drama series instead of making just a fun and superficial superhero series. The main characters are multi-dimensional and the main villain is insanely well portrayed. Hell's Kitchen really gives a dark vibe and makes you feel that pure evil is the norm there (slightly reminded me of the goth city in "The Crow").

If you like origin stories, you won't be disappointed as the writers did a great job depicting how this blind lawyer becomes a superhero even though he lacks overpowered abilities (e.g. compared to Superman) or money (e.g. Bruce Wayne). Also Foggy, Matt's only real friend and Karen are given enough screen time to help us understand them and connect with them.

This show has character and great story-telling. This show made me love TV again. Can't wait to see how they proceed from here.
