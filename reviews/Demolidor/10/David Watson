I've read the reviews from the people who hated it. Most have so seriously broken English in their reviews that I can't help but wonder if they've even read a single one of the (American) comics to begin with. No, this isn't a racist comment, merely an observant one.

Daredevil has always been about vigilante beat-downs. Matt doesn't really have any "superpowers" per se, other than heightened senses (except sight, obviously). What he relies upon is wit, skill, and training. He beats the **** out of the bad guys. It's what he does. It's what he as ALWAYS done, plain and simple.

I am thoroughly enjoying this series, and find that it is most definitely true to the original comic book rendition of my favorite childhood "superhero".

Now, some would say, "Aha! See? Childhood! This is just too juvenile and pedantic and amateurish to hold my interest." To these, I see that they have plainly stated that they only watched the first few episodes before they lost interest (yet they gleefully add a negative 1-star review). Now, I'll admit, it was a slow start for the first two or three, but it really picked up. Of course, then they say, "beat up the bad guys, wash, rinse, repeat"...what superhero movie or television show doesn't follow this? Seriously? The plot is very developed, but yes, it is dark. It is violent. It isn't for kids. If you want something all pristine and shiny, I suggest watching Superman: The Movie again.

Daredevil is about kicking the crap out of the bad guys and trying to make a violent city whole again. It always has been. It has never, NEVER, been anything BUT this.

If you can't appreciate this, you've not read the comics. Not a single one.
