The reason why Daredevil is such a great show is because it is quite interesting as to how they bring the characters from the comics into movies and now as a Netflix TV show. Despite the rating to be TV-MA or Rated R as other fans would see it all of the first 13 episodes of Season 1 were quite good because the way that they made the episodes makes it seem like its perfect and enjoyable. Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock/Daredevil he is great at playing the role as do the actors who played the supporting characters in season 1. Cant wait to see not just the next 13 episodes of Season 2 but of all the future episodes that are to come.
