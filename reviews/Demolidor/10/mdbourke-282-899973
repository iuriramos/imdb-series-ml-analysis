Firstly let me say, I am not a comic book reader. So, my awareness of Daredevil was just the Ben Affleck movie. OK, now with that out of the way, all I can base my review on are my thoughts. Simply, this shown is gritty, dark and intense in a good way. Some of the sequences are downright chilling. I always like to see a level of fragility with my superheroes, and our superhero has them in spades. Don't get me wrong, he is no weakling, but we always know he is just a man. There are those critics who are concerned this is not "family friendly" all I can say is thank god! On that point, why should any true vigilante story ever be family friendly? Adults need there own shows that have broader appeal, and this is one i am not ashamed to geek out on. It's bloody, its violent, and it's rough around the edges. Production values are just right for the content.
