One could think, well another Marvel, again. How could they bring something new? Some how they manage to create a gloomy atmosphere, organic movement from a scene to the other and you end up hooked by the action as well as the more settle moments.

Very fluid and the visual, the attention brought to the details remind me a bit of Hannibal. The shots of fight scenes are so dynamic and the one at the end of the second episode is just so credible... The casting is great, the main character couldn't be better for the show. The format of the show with the day's profession, the night's vigilante and the past are folded like braid, very tight and it keeps the interest all along. 

I am very surprise by the quality of Netflix, with this show, Orange is the new black and House of cards, they are major players now in the TV series scene.
