alright so this show is great. eventually daredevil's going to be fighting along side the Avengers, but for now, he's kicking ass down the street from Avengers Tower in Hell's Kitchen. I rated this show a 10 because Charlie Cox plays a great role as the protagonist and Wilson Fisk's character is written amazingly. However, in my opinion, I hate Foggy Nelson. I hate him with a burning fashion. Whoever the hell plays him is not good. He's an annoying character and bad actor and I think is taking the joy out of the show. Also, the girl is kind of annoying. I don't even know her name. But his assistant that they saved in the first episode is annoying and Foggy is awful. To be a good plot device, they should kill of Foggy early in season 2. Kingpin should like rip Foggy's fat head off his fat ass body to give Daredevil a nice motif. Or even the Punisher could come after Foggy to target Daredevil early to be honest. But to get away from the bad parts of the show, it is very well written. It connects nicely with the MCU and it's setting up perfectly for Matt Murdock to join the Avengers... as well as Jessica Jones... wink wink
