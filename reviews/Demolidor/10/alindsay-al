After loving the first season I have finally finished season 2 and it may be even better. After the end of last season the premise sees daredevil looking over hells kitchen. That is before a new player arrives killing off gang members and an old love returns into his life with a new mission. Charlie cox is back as daredevil and he is brilliant as the character. He truly plays off the differences between matt murdock and daredevil and the complexity between the dual identity really works. The returning characters of foggy and karen are back and fleshed out much better this season with both of them having real moments to shine this season. Now to the game changer, jon bernthal as the punisher was absolutely perfect. He stole the show of every scene he was in, he totally understood the character and nailed the deep dark characteristics of frank castle. Elodie young also did a great job as elektra, the character was allot of fun and I thought her and cox worked really well together. The story is really good because you have all the different sides of justice with the punisher vs daredevil. But then it focuses allot on the secret war going on and its really interesting. Yes the villain may not be as interesting but it works for this season and I can't wait to see how they develop it next. The script is really good with the drama being really impactful and the humour being used between characters. The style is brilliant the dark tone with amazing action scenes that can't be missed one stairwell scene especially comes to mind. Overall this is a great second season that makes me realise that Netflix can definitely be the future for marvel programming.
