I had originally put on the show just for background noise while I did other things on my other monitor. It was hard to concentrate on what I was doing through the first episode, and when the second episode started it had my full attention. I ended up binge watching the entire first season in 2 days! Amazing series! I hope they make a season 2. Charlie Cox was perfect as Matt Murdock! Because I had watched the old movie with Ben Affleck as Daredevil (years ago), I wasn't expecting much with this show... but after watching Charlie in the role I am totally hooked! For other shows I am always noticing plot holes, and hate it when stories have no explanation for anything, or give half-fast excuses hoping the viewer wouldn't notice; BUT this show explains things perfectly with their flashbacks and they don't do it all at once as to overwhelm the viewer. Love this approach, it makes you want to watch the next episode because they usually leave you on a hook!
