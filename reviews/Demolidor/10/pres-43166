I watched this show when it first came out in April, but have found myself writing this review today because I just got an IMDb account. After finishing the 13 episodes, I realized that this was the best product that Marvel Studios has ever put out. I have watched all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and TV shows and this has been my favorite of all of them. The acting is amazing and the cinematography makes you feel like you are watching a 13-hour long movie. The action and special effects are top-notch and thrilling and the fight scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. In total, this series is a true masterpiece and a work of art. I am looking forward to season two and season one of Jessica Jones, which hits Netflix in a couple of weeks
