Well dare devil what can i say...........someone likes comics! Finally a hero show that is like its graphic novels. With recent irritations like 'The Flash' and 'arrow' I had lost hope, but along came a blind lawyer to save the day, and by the end of watching the first series I guarantee he'll become one of your favorites.

With the perfect amount of violence, back story and twists this show will leave you thirsting for more. I don't care how you find a way to watch this show, either it be paying for Netflix or buying the DVDs when they come out, just find a way.........it will not disappoint! I tip my hat to all involved in the crafting of this gem!
