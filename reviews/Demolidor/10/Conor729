When Daredevil was first announced it promised something darker, gritter then what we have seen so far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). And it delivered with that and so much more.

With a great storyline that hooks the audience from the first episode we are treated to awesome fight scenes, surprise twists and quality acting. Most notable of those actors are Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, Elden Henson as Foggy Nelson and Vincent D'Onofrio as Wilson Fisk.

Charlie Cox plays Matt Murdock superbly, playing the Lawyer side with intelligence, wit and emotion while also playing a dark and gritty Daredevil, bring over some of that emotion Elden Henson plays a character who is mostly supporting but has some scene stealing moments and has great chemistry with all he shares scenes with. Vincent D'Onofrio brings compassion and tenderness to a character who is also a blood thirsty and in some case psychotic killer.

If you love a intelligent, powerful and master class TV show you can get addicted to then I highly suggest you give Daredevil a go.
