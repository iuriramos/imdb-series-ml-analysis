I saw the Daredevil movie from 2003 back when I was younger and remember really being drawn in by the concept. Unfortunately this screen adaption of the comic was quite disappointing to say the least. When I heard they were rebooting it for a television show I was hesitant. A friend recommended it to me so I figured I would give it a shot. A few days and 13 episodes later and I was glad I did.

This is arguably one of the best comic book adaptions ever put on film. It is the Daredevil that I had always hoped for. The show sets quite a dark and thrilling tone that is a stark contrast to most of Marvel's other movies. But don't let that put you off. The writing is superb and the tone is perfect for Daredevil. I almost thought I was watching a crime thriller at times, but then a scene would pop up with Daredevil in his black mask, kicking the crap out of the bad guys. And it sure was exciting to watch. The choreography was excellent. It's action filmed how action should be filmed.

And of course the character of Daredevil was awesome to put it simply. Charlie Cox did a great job playing both the troubled blind lawyer Matt Murdock, as well as the mysterious masked Daredevil. The rest of the cast didn't fall behind either.

The cinematography, the soundtrack, everything was amazing. I could go on, but I think the message is clear. Whether you are skeptical or a comic book geek, you have to check Daredevil out. You won't be disappointed.
