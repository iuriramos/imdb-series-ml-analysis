When I was a boy, I read the original Marvel Daredevil (apparently it was a revision of a 1940's comic). Of all the superheroes Marvel had devised, Daredevil seemed like the only real possibility (to my childish mind) of becoming a superhero. Apart from the heightened senses that the radiation gave him when blinded, he was still an ordinary man with no superpowers. Batman was stinking rich so he could have all the contraptions he used, but Daredevil only had his wits and fists.

In an early issue I saw that Matt Murdock trained as a gymnast to increase his athletic powers, as well as having been the son of a boxer. As a 14 year old I joined the high school gymnastics team to start my career as a superhero. Of course, no such thing happened. Instead I fell in love with the gymnastics training and pursued a career as a coach.

I watched Ben Afflick in his movie version of Daredevil and was mystified regarding Electra. I had stopped reading comics when I was 19 and this story line of Daredevil dating Electra came about after that.

Watching the Netflix TV series turned out to be an addictive surprise. Netflix has drawn upon those early Marvel stories but have made the story an adult drama that has a visceral reality about it. He may be a superhero, but Matt gets the snot kicked out of him as much as he beats the tar out of the bad guys. In the comic book, you rarely see him harmed, but in the TV series, the falls and assaults on him stun him and harm him as it would in reality.

I am grateful for this Netflix adaptation of my childhood favorite of superheroes. My wife can not watch it because of the intensity of the violence, but I find the series gripping.
