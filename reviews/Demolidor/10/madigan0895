It's obvious the Producers of this show did their homework, Do not believe any Negative reviews on this show as this is by far the Best Superhero adaptation on TV to date. The 1st episode left me with a sense of "Meh" but then something happened, the 2nd episode my son and I are both saying to each other how the story and characters came to life so suddenly and we were completely hooked.

The characters/actors in this show nail these characters brilliantly, and the Dialogue in this show Blew me away. DC needs to pay attention!! This is how you make a Superhero show! There is a ton of Heart put into this show and everyone involved deserves a ton of credit for it's production value, accuracy and Story. Well done Marvel!!
