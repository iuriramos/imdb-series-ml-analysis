Hear this CW and Felicity? Go away somewhere far. Let begin with the central character, Matt. Compared to Oliver Queen he is not an angry, attention-whore, who just randomly hide things and reveal them with the most annoying childish honesty.

Matt is complex, cool, deep and responsible for the town. He like the normal Arrow (s01-2) rejects murder, but do not hesitate, when he needed to be tough, in order to save people. Unlike Queen, he not cry every time about: THIS IS MAH CITEE AND I NEEDED DO SAVEE IT! And he forgot to repeat THIS IS MAH CITEE every time, thanks Netflix. 

About reccuring, side and minor characters.

Wesley - Loyal, reliable and serious. Unfortunately ends with the bad side of the gun, because of Karen. Vanessa - Charming, but not really remarkable. Stick - Powerful, first time clich√©d, but revealed as a cold-blooded murderer and leading Elektra to the "barbaric" side. Foggy - First time is humorous, but later he became more serious. He now able to fight for his beliefs, at his own level. Chinese woman - I forgot her name, but her drug-labor is remarkable as well as her workers too. 

Villains: Fisk - Totally awesome, he is angry and not cold. He is easily gets mad and able to kill with a single punch. For Vanessa or his loved ones, he will do anything. However his "business" may required a more stable men, he at least understood the nature of the power. "Castle", hero of the folk. I think he is sympathetic, because he kill and not moralize. The dim-witted people surely liked him, as he just kill the "bad" people and not do "half" work as "Matt do". However in his zeal the Punisher pave the way for Fisk.
