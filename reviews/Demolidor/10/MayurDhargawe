Darker, violent and grittier than even Nolan's Dark Knight, in fact, darker than anything Marvel or DC has depicted on screen so far, Netflix's Daredevil series is shockingly gripping, even if you don't like Daredevil or any other superhero for that matter.

Preoccupied with questions of morality, the blind superhero discreetly manages to convince the viewer that he in fact, is just a human being with flesh and bones that witnessing the evil in his world, ultimately took a stand to act against it. 

The great thing about the show is that it's remarkably patient, resisting the urge to tell its viewers everything at once.

Slow burning and vastly benefited by its noir style, the Sin City resemblance is no accident; the series inspires from Frank Miller's run on the character and it was him who effectively made gritty, morally gray superhero stories stick.

Charlie Cox gives Matt Murdock an understated and serious charisma. But the show's most memorable performance comes from Vincent D'Onofrio as Wilson Fisk. He's crafted Marvel's most soulful villain since Alfred Molina's Dr. Octopus in Spider-Man 2.

With so many new superhero shows on television, Daredevil successfully raises the bar to unprecedented heights and pushes the envelope by going down dark paths the Marvel Cinematic Universe hasn't gone down before.

To conclude, Daredevil is the most rock-solid superhero crime thriller experience that you're ever likely to get, from film and TV combined.
