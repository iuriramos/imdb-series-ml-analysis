** Spoiler Free ***

Well I gotta say after being disappointed by 2003's Daredevil starring Ben Affleck I didn't have that much hope for this Netflix series. AND I HAVE TO SAY: " I WAS WRONG, WELL DONE MARVEL YOU DID IT AGAIN". Charlie Cox casting as Matt Murdock A.K.A "Daredevil" ( the man without fear) was an awesome Joyce, and the rest of the cast as well!!! After seeing the first episode my mind was blown away like LITTERLY!!! After every episode you just want to keep seeing more and believe me it gets better every time... The action sequences look real and its noting that marvel has ever done before. It has everything 1. Accion 2. Drama 3. And a bit of romance And of course 4. Allot of easter eggs, Come on you can't have a marvel movie o well in this case a marvel series without some awesome and cool easter eggs from past marvel movies and a bit of the future installments, so keep your eyes open!

Further more the tone of this series is well adapt for a character such as Daredevil in his neighborhood know as Hell's kitchen. I know that allot of kids would want to watch it but I would advice to the adults to see it with your kids it doesn't have inappropriate things just not for kids under 13. And for the rest it has its humors here and there and of course If you are an MCU fan you'll LOVE IT!!! 

BELIEVE ME! YOU WON'T BE Disappointed!!! P.S can't wait for Daredevil Season 2...
