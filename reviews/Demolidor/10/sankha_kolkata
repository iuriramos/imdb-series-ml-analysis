After a long pause and huge recommendation from a very close friend i have decided to start watching Marvel's Daredevil. To me its just mind blowing and a masterpiece in making. From childhood we r mostly focus on X men or Spiderman and later on Fantastic four then Avengers. But the 2nd best character representation after Batman in comics is i feel " Daredevil".. And here Director has made no exclusions to judge my opinion wrong. Fantastic direction with amazing acting skills by almost every one in the crew . I am just Making my fingers cross to see this venture can run for at least 5-6 more years. After a long i am so fascinated to watch something incredible. Its getting into my head. Cheers and kudos to Marvel that again they have committed in their ideas and make our life fantastic. Just go guys grab a beer and start watching it.
