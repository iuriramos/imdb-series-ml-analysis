Sadly (sorry Netflix) don't have sub, but having read about DD series, was desperate to see, and FINALLY it came out on DVD this month in UK. So purchased as soon as it was on sale, and I was NOT disappointed.... really got into it very quickly, and found it truly enthralling all the way through. Have never 'binge watched' a series even if downloaded on 'box set' TV, but this I just had to - couldn't wait to see how it developed, what happened to the characters, and there were truly some heart stopping moments and shocks along the way. Great job by producers/writers and actors. All characters had a real attraction, and well developed. Even 'Kingpin', dreadful person though he was/is, had depth. And even the 'good guys' were all sorts of shades and complexities. Just first class. Have followed the character from youth in the books, this does them justice. And a definite difference to the Marvel films, extremely dark and gritty, as it should be in Hells Kitchen', but in a very good and satisfying way. So now, waiting for DVD issue of s.2 along with Jessica Jones/Cage et al. ... really may have to rethink this 'avoid taking out more subs' with this quality. Well done to all...
