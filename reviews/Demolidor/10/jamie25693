Truly amazing!(must see!)

From the first episode I was hooked! I must admit that when I first saw the trailer I was not convinced that this show was going to live up to it's expectations. But it sure did! 

The acting = 10/10 I have never heard of Charlie Cox/seen him in anything else before and I was blown away by his performance as 'Matt Murdock'. The way the episodes were shot are just right, I also loved that it was quite dark because 'Daredevil' himself is a dark character. There are a few funny moments in the episodes but not to many which suits the show. All acting was perfect and I cannot wait for season 2.
