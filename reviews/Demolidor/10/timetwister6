Frank Miller's DareDevil couldn't have been more perfectly adapted to a live action series. I will keep this short and to the point, this show displays the darker side of Marvel and is one of the greatest shows I have ever seen. The action sequences and casting choices are outrageously good and you will not be disappointed. He doesn't get his iconic costume until the end of the first season, but you will not be disappointed. If anything I suggest you watch the first few episodes and if you do not like it than this show is not for you. With that being said I also want to add that there is strong, and on one occasion, very graphic violence. Obviously it's not a kid friendly show so keep that in mind before watching it with family. I hope this review was of help and I hope you enjoy the show
