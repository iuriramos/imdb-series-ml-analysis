Without a doubt the best comic book based show. More sophisticated with a more credible story line than Arrow, which is also over the top with toxic saccharine melodramatics and the top heavy fantastical plot of The Flash. Plus no irritating, exhausting, nauseating prolonged super hero romance crap that saturates Arrow and The Flash. Stellar performances by the entire cast and sigh...no annoying characters you pray will meet their demise, (sorry but there are a couple characters in Arrow and The Flash that annoy me like wearing a heavy wool coat in the Sahara and I am not talking about villains. This is why I ditched Marvel's Agents of S.H.E.I.L.D.). Beats the crap out of the dragged out..yawn..Gotham. Although I am not a big fan of violence, the fight scenes are executed (excuse the pun) beautifully although a few are a bit too graphic for my taste. The show just gets better with every episode and I am rabid for the premiere of season two...cannot come soon enough.
