I love that Marvel went dark with this one, and Netflix is the exact right place for this show. 

Although the storyline is not necessarily the most compelling and can actually get a bit disconnected at times, the actors are phenomenal and the way it's told is great. It makes a few references to the recent Marvel movies and superheroes, and it's going to be interesting if they decide to tie this into the other shows/movies, as it is completely different in it's tone. I'm kind of hoping they keep it completely separate. 

One of those shows that you can't help binge-watching.
