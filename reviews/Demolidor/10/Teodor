This series left me speechless . I walked in expecting low budget Captain America . What I got instead was an interesting plot , compelling characters and memorable moments . I guess you need to have big flying ships and explosions when you release a movie in cinema , expecting millions , but this series released an epic , grounded story , expecting to leave people in awe . It did not disappoint . Bravo ! Looking forward to season 2 . Hope they'll get Netflix in East Europe this year or the next . 

* My only grudge I have , although a small one , is the red outfit . I know they had to have it in there , and it's basically the only comic-related element they couldn't ditch , but ... It could have been done better . Somewhere between this version and the 2003 one . Just saying . Oh , well ...
