Great series. Fortunately there is absolutely nothing to do with the disaster of the film Daredevil from 2003. I do not know how much you are familiar with the main character, but in the end it is not so important. The series will love the ones who know exactly what it is, but also those who are not fans of comics. In short, DD is a copy of Marvel's Batman, but that is not rich and he's blind (that is blind!). The series follows his life from the beginning of activity in his town, but we also have flashbacks history and not just his. The series is excellent because it's not just another series about a superhero, but we have a lot of elements of drama. Even I was a little reminded of the series Breaking Bad. Action scenes are incredibly well taken and completed, I was just surprised because it's just a series, not a movie of 100+ million, look very realistic. Also I can not jump very inspired actor Vincent D'Onofrio as the main villain. Overall, the series I was pleasantly surprised. I can not wait for the second season, which has not yet been officially confirmed. Subjective 10 from me.
