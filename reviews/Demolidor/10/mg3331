I'd have to say that once I started watching series 2 I was hooked as I was with season 1 but now that I have watched all thirteen episodes I'd have to say it leaves the first series which was itself great far behind. I did not think that the hallway fight in episode two of series 1 could be beaten but the one on the stairwell in episode three is just unbelievable. This show has set a new standard in quality programming that most others have been unable to reach (the nearest I would say is Gotham) and this is what the superhero fan wants. Great action, great characters, great storyline. While The Punisher does stuff that you can't agree with you can't help but like him. I'm pleased they included Electra this time along with the return of the very obnoxious Stick. To say how it all turns out would be to spoil it for other viewers but I will say it came to a satisfactory conclusion in all. Will there be a season 3. I would bet my house on it judging by the overall reaction from fans. Thanks for giving us this and let's see it all out on DVD very soon.
