(i may have grammar mistakes. sry) If u liked the arrow you will like this one 2. its same as the arrow but with less bullshit. and u will know what i mean if you are like me and this is what a lil bit screwed for u the show. good closer and not shitty one (won't elaborate here). it had good background story (short, interesting and informative and it didn't gave you usefulness details. (it corrected me from unusfull. is it the right way? really?). liked the music so, ya.. watch it. some shows u will like and some what. i have good friends who like the genre and didn't liked flesh or the arrow and some didn't liked this show. it really depends so just see for your self instead of reading stupid reviews from unskilled grammar people.
