marvels daredevil season 1 is great but it's quite a slow if you compare with another TV series but still you don't want to miss this. particularly telling about the recent experience of marvels daredevil season 2 it's awesome!!! season 1 is nothing compared to season 2 but still there are so many loose ends in season 2.ending is not that good.the way they started and then story was at its peak position in middle of season.i didn't get this things that's why i'm telling them as loose ends like-story with Wilson Fisk after all what did he wanted ? what did he get by freeing Frank Castle? if he can free him then why can't he become free ? and yeah one of the most important question who or what is yakuza? what happened to those people who were experimented with their blood sort of things?they just leave that topic. and yeah how did the nobu return?is he immortal?then why they haven't explained it. and yeah that colonel was the blacksmith? what about the big hole in the ground? and yeah in s01e07 stick kneels to some scar guy and tells black sky is no longer a threat then what about elektra and that boss guy?
