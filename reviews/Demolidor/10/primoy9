This TV series is a masterpiece. It is by far the best superhero like show. It has some wonderful scenes, you don't usually have in series, where you just enjoy the picture. Season 1 was my favorite season in all the series (yes I watched Breaking Bad) and season 2 continued and upgraded it. Season two had the best fighting scenes, best romantic scenes and best redemption scene I ever saw on TV. 

But it is not just the directing. Actors are brilliant, story is interesting and has a lot of background on people and most importantly the bad guys are not just bad. You see them from both sides and you may even like the bad guy even cheer for him and at the same time still like the Daredevil. Villains also last more than one part, so you met them more and they are not just crazy people who want to destroy everything. 

It is also not generic. You know all those shows that hero fights villain in minute 20 loses and then beats him at the end. Daredevil can always lose the fight, you do know he won't die, but that is a must. All the costars can also be in danger. Daredevil also shows a lot of weaknesses, he gets injured, needs help. Show also doesn't limit it self with time, so that helps and they stretch some parts and finish the story, but still manage to end on a cliffhanger. 

To summarize it this is a must watch for all of you who love shows like Arrow, Jessica Jones and other superhero/vigilante shows. Even if you are not a fan of these kind of shows and you just want to watch a great series, this is definitely one of the best ones.
