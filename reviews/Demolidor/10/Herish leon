Daredevil is the best Heroes TV Show i have ever seen . and probably the only one who didn't screw it in second season.

Thanks to the bad impression we had on daredevil based on the movie , it came as shock when we saw first season . Brutality , Great Plot , and awesome production . However the favorite part for me is the quotes and speeches . they are not just some random words on the plot most of them are very well written. I even write some of them down and keep them for my self.

If you are looking for a TV show with a lot of action , Brutality and sensible plots . daredevil is for you .
