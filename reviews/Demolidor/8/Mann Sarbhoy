The whole season is really well directed in the best possible realistic manner. Hats off to the writer, director, the actors and every artist associated along with the crew. It keeps the viewer engrossed. The direction has been pretty awesome along with the artists. Thanks to the writer who wrote the events in such a manner that they merged into each other reasonably, keeping the viewer interested and not distracted, wonderful writing. The idea of the associated persons also worked of not mentioning the actual comic names such as 'King Pin'. It's just about the last episode that spoils the whole series' interest. The Daredevil avatar of Matt Murdock is out of its realistic point of view in this episode. He is a big show off this time (unlike the other episodes), which is 'really distracting'. The helmet of the costume adds to it. The last fight between Daredevil avatar and Wilson Fisk was also not up to the mark. These facts seriously lowered my interest about the upcoming season for which I previously was excited. It would be really great if the whole DD team could get improvements over these issues. It's then a complete piece of artwork. Previous episodes had me a wonderful experience.
