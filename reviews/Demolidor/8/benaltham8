I am not a fan of comic books or films based on them personally, I find them tedious and repetitive, yet I really enjoyed Daredevil. The acting is excellent from nearly everyone and though it didn't change the formula of superhero films significantly it did seem fresh.

The acting is stellar, especially from the leads such as Charlie Cox and Vondie-Curtis Hall really making an impact. However Fisk to me seems like a weak villain. I get the whole situation with him being a child due to his traumatic experiences, yet I just can't see how this obese child could run a crime business. Personally I think that Wesley should have been the villain with Fisk as his bitch, but that isn't the case.

My other problem is that there are too many episodes were nothing happens. This problem is mainly in the Caron and Ben storyline, every bit of information they get, nothing happens to it because of a complication. Also some scenes with Foggy are a little cringe, and seeing that it's meant to have a dark tone they should tone down the cringe scenes.

Apart from this it was very good, and the fact it's a series means that you can have more of a bond with the characters. Like when Ben dies I was nearly shouting at the TV (same when Wesley died, he was great). It was great so I recommend it, though it does have some flaws.
