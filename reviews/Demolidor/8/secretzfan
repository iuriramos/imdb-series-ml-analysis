Daredevil season 2 loses all of its complexities that made season 1 a hit when they lost Stephen Deknight as a show runner. However it still makes up for this with a better action sequences and a great performance by Jon Berthal's Punisher. 

The show manages to add some more cooler and enjoyment moments even with the loss of its show runner. Making things a lot bigger and a lot more interesting. While it can't live up to the first season it still a blast to watch as Matt Murdock is put in some tough situations and has to find a way to deal with it all while still being the hope that he wants to show for the city in it needs for corruption. 

The season give some spectacular moments between Punisher and Daredevil and also brings back another fan favorite and has him face the Punisher. I won't spoil who but it is amazing when you figure it out. 

Sadly the season also suffers from its secondary plot with Elektra making Matt feel like more of a ply thing for Elektra and a plot thread to have Foggy and Matt have a lot of drama in it. 

That being said it also gives and intriguing back story for Elektra that I had liked a lot, but all fails not to save the Elektra's changing personalities as well as her attitude. 

Overall the season still falters but still manages to have fun in Hell's Kitchen.
