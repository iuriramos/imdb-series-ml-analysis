I am a "late-watcher". I work nights, so rarely actually watch TV. So I just began watching Daredevil on Netflix. OMG! Shock-o when Vincent is the bad guy!!!! Nooooo! Not my "Bobby"!!!'

I don't think I can watch it now. Bobby is not, can not be a bad guy. From a Forever Robert "Bobby" Goren fan!! I refuse to watch movies where he's played the villain. I love you, Vincent/Bobby.

Nut case? I know. Even in the end when Bobby was having his meltdown, I could barely watch the episodes and I wanted to yell at his mother (character) for being mean to him. Don't know why they wrote the characters mental demise like that, he was brilliant. 

However, I really liked Daredevil up until then. : )
