Just Finished Watching Marvel's Daredevil Season 1. I must say Awesome Action Series. The action feels very realistic and brutal. I would highly recommend this show to Daredevil fans and fans of darker heroes like Batman. Cant wait for the next season! I wish he becomes more devilish in the next season(finger crossed) Vanessa in the series is kind of irritating. She had some screws loosed but I loved her character! She reminded me so much of Livia Saint from Punisher. Vanessa's entire point as a character was to give Fisk his needed character development and humanize him to the audience. In total it is an interesting series and i am hooked.
