I'm liking this new DAREDEVIL series. It's decently written. The production values are high. All is well...EXCEPT now and then, when the camera-work is wiggly at the wrong time. 

That camera wiggling is enough to break audience attention and mess it all up. YES, hand-held camera work saves time/money...but it can also ruin a scene/project. I hope they figure this out soon. I hate camera-ruined scenes.

I've said all I want to say about this TV series. Now I'm filling up the space I've been told I must if I want to submit my thoughts about 'DAREDEVIL'. Not cool. Fascistic at least. The rule that one must tender at least 10 lines is bogus/wrong/bad. Users should be able to submit any size review they choose. Beep the fascist controllers.
