I couldn't think of a better place for Daredevil than Netflix.

It's dark, it's gritty and it's violent; not something that would be as good if it were to air on any standard channel.

The opening credits are amazing and perhaps the best I've seen on any TV show. There is also no previously segments which means more time for the actual show, along with no ads, some of the episodes go for 57 minutes rather than the usual 40-45 minutes.

This is just like any other MCU project; the casting is brilliant. Charlie Cox is brilliant as Matt Murdock and Daredevil, Elden Henson as Foggy is entertaining to watch as was Toby Leonard Moore as Wesley. I found Karen (Deborah Ann Woll) to be boring and sometimes even annoying but I am very interested in seeing more of Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson). The show is full of strong characters from the main cast to the smaller guest starring roles.

The highlight of the whole series for me is Vincent D'Onofrio. I've known of D'Onofrio and some of his roles but never watched anything of his and he just completely kick ass as Wilson Fisk! One moment you're seeing him as this shy, charming man talking to Vanessa (Ayelet Zurer) and the next he is violently and psychotically killing someone in some very impressive death scenes.

I loved that we didn't see or hear anything about Fisk in episode one, his name was mentioned in episode two and it wasn't until episode three that we finally got to see him.

There are mentions of the Battle of New York from The Avengers and little mentions of other, yet to be seen, characters in the Daredevil and Marvel universe.

One thing that was constantly on my mind; why didn't anyone recognize that the black cloth over his head didn't have eyeholes?

The red costume, which appears in the final episode, is practical and still looks awesome. It looks like something you would wear if you happen to be a superhero in this present time and a costume that would actually protect you in a fight rather than look good.

Whilst the 2003 Daredevil movie is probably one of the worst comic book movies, I'm still entertained when watching it but this is so much better; from the costume, to the actor, the story and the loss of those milky eye contacts.

Season Two could not come fast enough for me!

********************* SEASON TWO************************************

If I thought I loved Season One, that's nothing compared to how much I love this season.

Most of that is due to the addition of Frank Castle/The Punisher to the cast! Jon Bernthal is absolutely brilliant in this role and always stole the focus even from the lead and titled character.

There is a lot more action and stunts, if possible, a lot more blood and violence. It's refreshing to see that when a character gets hit and/or stabbed, that they actually bleed and bruise unlike in some shows where they don't show any signs of injury.

The show is still full of strong and interesting characters; whomever Marvel/Netflix has on casting is doing a spectacular job! Foggy is definitely the heart of this show even though he doesn't seem to have a huge storyline.

Karen Page on the other hand annoys the crap out of me! Not only is she an annoyed character, I'm stumped by how she seems to be able to go anywhere she wants and gets jobs anywhere without any accreditation or experience; she a secretary and yet gets to be in the courtroom and even worse, left alone with a ruthless killer.

In some moments of this season, Matt started to get on my nerves. Starting to become self- righteous and apparently switches between loving Karen and Elektra like the flick of a switch!

I can't wait to Season Three, The Defenders and The Punisher series. Netflix has done an amazing job with these shows and the characters.
