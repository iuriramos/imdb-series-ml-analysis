I liked the first season. The screenplay was very well written. The show has a dark genre, which keeps you on the edge, mostly. It was refreshing to see the Batman spirit in the devil of Hell's Kitchen. The main character's turmoil with morality is quite well handled and is not redundant, though this concept is clich√©. The character of Wilson Fisk portrayed by Vincent D'Onofrio is captivating. The character of Madame Gao played by Wi Ching Ho is what I expect to cause more trouble to our Daredevil in the upcoming seasons. Lets see what season 2 has to offer. I only wish, this does not end up being a long soap opera. I would expect finiteness and finality to the story and characters respectively.
