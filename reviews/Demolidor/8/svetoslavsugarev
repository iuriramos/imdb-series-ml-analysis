Well, the first season was nothing special, it started well but there wasn't much of a plot. Matty was kind of roaming about trying to figure out this or that but nothing really interesting about Hells kitchen's crime world, except the Kingpin who was kind of intimidating, well developed character. I think there was too much of ''man with the mask'' and

''my town'' which reminded of Batman and lets face it when he finally got the costume it was silly looking thing and still is. The 2nd season was different. More brutal, gritty, introduced many new characters, important ones, Electra is cool and hot, The Kingpin scary, the Punisher rocks and Matty .... well he is still boring. after I watched the 1st season I rated it 6 stars, but now I'm watching the 10th episode of the 2nd season it is about to become 8 star show. Next step is Jessica Jones and ha there was a tiny connection between the two.
