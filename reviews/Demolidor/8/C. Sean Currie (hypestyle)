"Marvel's Daredevil" is a Netflix original TV series based on the Marvel comic book superhero. Charlie Cox plays the main character: Matthew Murdock, a newly-minted attorney, who was blinded in a car accident when he was a child. In the present day, he gently spars opponents in the courtrooms of New York City (and even with his law partner "Foggy" Nelson (Elden Hensen) about what type of clients to seek out); by night, he violently spars with various criminal elements as "The Devil of Hell's Kitchen". As is eventually revealed, the accident that blinded Matt as a child also gradually enhanced his other senses to super-human levels. He also was taught martial arts by a mysterious mentor.

Compared to other superheroes, Daredevil seems quite vulnerable, despite his heroic pedigree. In fight scenes, the bad guys don't stay down with a single punch. Several of them are, in fact, able to fight back relatively competently. Frequently, Daredevil has to limp back home-- or to a nurse's apartment-- badly bruised and cut. This is occasionally juxtaposed with flashbacks to Murdock's childhood with his single father, a boxer who never left the lower rungs of the profession.

The main villain of the series is construction magnate Wilson Fisk, played by Vincent D'Onofrio. In the comics, Fisk is known as the Kingpin, a Mob boss with wide reach. In this series, Fisk's rise to the underworld's highest echelons has only recently begun. Both hero and villain are seen building their reputations and taking on new challenges in their own unique manners.

This is a much darker look at the "Marvel Universe" compared to the movies released since 2008 that have a shared narrative continuity. Technically, this is the same world where the Avengers characters all exist, but they're nowhere to be found in these stories at all, and that's probably for the best. This series is apparently deliberately crafted as a film noir crime-action drama, and less as a colorful showcase for flamboyant heroes and villains.

Look for solid supporting roles played by Deborah Ann Woll, Vondie Curtis-Hall, and Ayelet Zurer. The series is able to tell its narrative effectively in 13 episodes. As of this writing, the series has been renewed for a second season. Hopefully the same creative parties will be involved.
