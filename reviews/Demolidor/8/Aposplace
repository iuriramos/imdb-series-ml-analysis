I was pleasantly surprised with the value of this show's production.What really took me away though, was the characters' development and the plot and storytelling within just 13 episodes. The actors did a wonderful job and were really believable as their characters grew. The inner battle of DD and Wilson Fisk with their own past and demons was described in a very convincing way.The dark tone and the slightly gory scenes here and there made the whole experience even better. The whole concept of Marvel's Universe is simply an endless source of material for TV and Cinema. Keep them coming Marvel. Keep them coming
