The series is cool, good story, but Mr. Charlie Cox need to improve a lot, The Dare Devil ignores the pain should show strength.

The Uniform is a joke, please put the original uniform, the current uniform appears Captain America.

The ideal uniform should be the red uniform, I confess that would look like the mask opening.

The beginning of the series was pretty cool, but it was a bit slurred, with some expendable episodes.

Mr. Vincent D'Onofrio perfect in this role, impeccable.

It is a very good series, has some flaws as all but repeat the uniform was terrible.

Another thing i did not censorship than 18 years, have not seen anything as shocking as well to justify 18 years of censorship.
