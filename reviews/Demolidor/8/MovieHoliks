My sister and bro-in-law recently turned me onto this Netflix original. It's been awhile since I saw the 2003 Ben Affleck film, so it's hard for me to compare the series with that film, but overall I think I like this even better-?? At the moment, I'm on like episode 8 or so.

Blind attorney Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) works in the legal profession by day, but at night he becomes a vigilante on the streets, which are controlled by a rising mastermind crime lord Wilson Fisk, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, in one of the best performances of his career I'd say-?? I read at Wikipedia that the creators of this show see this series as a crime show first, super-hero show second. That's more the way it plays. And I must say, the fight/action sequences in this are some of the best I've ever seen on network television-?? I also like Rosario Dawson's budding amalgam of Temple/Night Nurse- adds a nice touch to the series. Elden Henson, Deborah Ann Woll, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Ayelet Zurer and Bob Gunton also round out a fine cast. 

I read that this show, as part of the "Marvel Cinematic Universe", will eventually lead into a mini-series for "The Defenders", which will also include the characters Luke Cage, Iron Fist and Jessica Jones. Will be interesting to see how all this comes together.
