12 years ago there was a movie called "Daredevil". With amazing villains such as Bullseye and Kingpin, as well as the agile super-heroine Elektra making their live-action debuts, the movie seemed like it could be a hit. Sadly, we all know how that story ended. With both "Daredevil" and the spin-off movie "Elektra" being critical flops it seemed like the Matt Murdock's live-action days were numbered. In fact, Daredevil was all but forgotten about until Marvel and Netflix announced their own string of television series all with connecting universes within the MCU, leading up to "The Defenders" another series that will act as a team up between the shows. The first of these shows to come out was, you guessed it, "Daredevil". This show would decide the fate of the entire connecting universe for these shows. Fans eagerly waited for the show until April 9th, 2015 when the series dropped on Netflix. And it was amazing. With excellent fight scenes as well-choreographed as the church scene in "Kingsman: The Secret Service", cinematography that would make Murdock envious, and a plot as down to Earth as "The Dark Knight" without getting too intense all the time, "Daredevil" truly is the best comic book show on television today. Every episode is a thrill and every fight scene is breath taking. "Daredevil" doesn't feel the need to spend the entire season setting up the hero's origin, trusting that those watching the show know what they are getting into. With an amazing story and even better acting, there is no reason not to watch this show. The only bad part of this show is the fact that we have to wait a whole year for season two. 8/10 would watch again says IGN.
