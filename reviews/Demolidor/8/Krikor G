This show is worth watching, regardless of its downfalls. The acting is impressive, the setting is authentic, the filming is well done and the script is pretty good. There are two issues with this show: The first is the main character. I don't know how others feel, but I thought Daredevil was a strong, built, bad*ss guy that could not only take a beating, but sure as hell give one. In this show, he's kind of wimpy. He gets beaten up a lot and I understand that the show tries to portray how Murdocks are good at taking a punch. But Daredevil coming that close to death? And with that frequency? It's disappointing. Cox should be more muscular and destroy enemies without being destroyed himself. Second, the storyline could use a little more plot twists or excitement. It's a bit too predictable and slow. There are many boring conversations that the show could do without. If those two are improved a bit, the second season will be a killer!
