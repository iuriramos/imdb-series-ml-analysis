There are so many superhero shows out there. But Daredevil is different and better in a few ways.

The story remains understandable and simple. A viewer should not have to concentrate too hard to keep up with a TV show. 13 episodes means the story doesn't have to get repetitive and confusing like in Flash and Shield. Quality is better than quantity. 22 episodes is too much for some shows. One villain is more menacing than a new villain each week.

The actors are good. Charlie Cox is a likable and understated actor. The hero is vulnerable and not infallible. Vincent d'Onofrio is impressive as the villain of the season. His character is well developed. There may not be a bevy of beauties like "Arrow" but when the story is good it doesn't matter.

A few faults. The lighting is too dark in some sequences. Things can move slowly in some parts. At first I thought the fighting is a bit too expert for a blind person even with powers. Some fight scenes are a bit too long.

CW and ABC could learn from this show. Quality vs quantity. Looking forward to season 2.
