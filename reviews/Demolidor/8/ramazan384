in my opinion,this series does not deserve 9.2.this point as like a bit exaggerated. Daredevil be adapted very well but as for me it's actual score is around 7.6-7.9.Something is still missing in the series, but I can not find.it like something or not or missing.And daredevil does not feel like a real hero. therefore, as if another superhero to come and save her therefore I could not warm up to him. Actually i think i'm stay under the influence Ben Affleck's movie version. so it takes time to get i used to new characters. so while we waiting for the new film will be shoot.With the announcement of Affleck's Batman role frankly I have let me down. I hope it opens the door to new season bigger adventure for us and bring new mystery.
