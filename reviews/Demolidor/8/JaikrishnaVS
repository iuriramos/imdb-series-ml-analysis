After being thoroughly disappointed by the Ben Affleck-movie version, I started watching the Netflix series with no expectations what-so-ever. The series though came as a pleasant surprise. This was more of what the Marvel universe deserved. If you were to ask me what are the major plus points when comparing the movie with this series, I would say -The Script. Tightly woven and keeping you to the edge of your seat. The cast of Charlie Cox, Deborah Ann Woll and Elden Henson just grew into the characters and can easily be considered the mainstay of the series. 

If this is what the Marvel universe can offer us as a series then i will take it any day.
