I'm a huge comic fan but never a big Daredevil fan. His stories were always formulaic and although none were bad, I cant say that they were amazing either. I am just glad they stayed away from Electra and Bullseye which is when the comic really got cheesy though I suspect we will be seeing those characters soon. Maybe they will do a better job in the show because the comics and movie did a horrible job with the characters. Anyway, this show is above average. I gave it a couple of extra points for good acting and decent dialog. There is a lot of back story in the show and sometimes it got boring but I felt that the characterization was needed even if it was not exciting content. I think the weak spot in the show right now is the Kingpin as I just don't find him intimidating at all, not physically and not intellectually. I think they need to focus on making him a bit more menacing. Im glad that this show is OK because I really hated Arrow and thought that Agents of Shield was also too bland to watch. I am looking forward to the 2nd season.
