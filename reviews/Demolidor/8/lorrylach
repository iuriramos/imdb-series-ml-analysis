I would have loved to given this a 10. It was a fantastic show! Karens To whiny dragging friends into her drama getting them killed. She uses her sweet cry baby sympathetic ways to manipulate men into getting what she wants.

I was even more disgusted when she said she was from VERMONT. She's nothing like a Vermonter. No accent like we have! I hoped shed get murdered for the murders she caused to happen!

Every time I saw here I got nauseous! 

Electra was amazing in the moves she performed. She really added to the show. 

Foggy was also with good humor. I felt badly at times for him. He was treated with such disregard by Matt an Karen.

Besides her I loved DARE DEVIL. I recommend it.
