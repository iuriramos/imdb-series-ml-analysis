Here is my take so far on the new series Daredevil. Drama-wise, I find the story good with a lot of things we can relate to and learn from with the turmoil going on these days. Although, like so many other Marvel comics, I still find the rebooting a little bit disturbing, but I guess that adds to what keeps it interesting and worth going through all over again. With regards to the fight scenes, a lot of them are really good; but surprisingly they're not consistent. It's like they had different fight choreographers for every fight scene, or maybe different stunt actors. In one scene, it's like watching Jason Bourne fighting another high level agent; then in another scene, it's like watching a fight in a stage play of Romeo and Juliet with the steps clearly cadenced and danced to. As for the characters, I find it weird that whenever Matt Murdock puts on the mask he seems to be using his eyes more than his other senses. For no reason, he can easily find a woman's soft purse without trying. He just goes to the couch and gets it from behind a pillow. He can walk into a room for the first time and knows exactly how things are laid out inside. I find Ben Affleck's version from the movie more realistic in comparison. Charlie Cox isn't to blame, though. The Director should have seen to it. As for Wilson Fisk, I think he's the softest and lamest Kingpin I've ever seen. The only thing Vincent D'Onofrio contributed to the character is shaving his head, the rest is all script. You still see the same Vincent D'Onofrio as he is on screen in all of his other movies, just acting in another name delivering his lines and with a shaved head this time. As for Foggy Nelson, I think Elden Henson did a noteworthy acting for the role.
