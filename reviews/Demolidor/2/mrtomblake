I like the core idea of Daredevil. To take a character from a comic book and flesh it out in a television series is a sound concept. I'm not sure if Daredevil was the right character to have his own series. I only managed to get as far as episode three, yet I feel as if I know as much as I need to about him. I couldn't bare to sit through another. I found it to be tedious, predicable and clich√©d. The worst offence being the back story. 

During interludes in the plot, there are flashbacks to Matt Murdock's childhood. These flashbacks begin with the accident that caused Murdock to lose his sight. The primary focus with these moments is his relationship with his father. There is very little original here. His father was a boxer, the type that has been in so many movies and TV shows before. The guy that takes a lot of punishment yet stays standing until the end. This plot devise is repeatedly used is because it's an allegory for the human experience. No matter what life throws at you, you have to keep fighting. I just wish Daredevil had done something new with it. It felt like I was watching Franco Zeffirelli's The Champ.

As for the present day plot, Daredevil is a morality story. Matt Murdock is a lawyer, so his dual personalities are in conflict with each other. His profession requires him to work within the rules of law, yet he breaks these rules at night when he wears the Daredevil costume. He becomes a vigilante, a self appointed judge, jury and concussion causer.

Daredevil just doesn't work for me. In Episode one there is a reference to The Avengers. Daredevil and The Avengers are supposed to exist in the same world, despite being totally different. The Avengers has a fantastical story, while Daredevil attempts to be deeply grounded in reality. For me it felt like I was watching Damages, with the occasional hand to hand combat scene thrown in.
