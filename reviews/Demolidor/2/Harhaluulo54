Heard some people praising the new Daredevil series which existence I didn't even know about. My first priority was to check out how neatly it be deserving the praise. Not very neatly I would say.

The series starts of with a b glass drama writing executed with acting about as good as in Interstellar, talked over with a dialog directly from The Interview and filled with characters as lame and forced as they have in True Detective. 

The dialog is so cheesy it made my speakers turn into.. well, cheese. But not just any kind of cheesy. Creamy, soft cheese. Sticky cheese. The kinda cheese you will suffocate into if you don't chew it well before swallowing. 

The characters are worse than in True Detective. "I am a badass, btw, I don't sleep." This time we have guy who "Btw, I am blind." In the movie, it never bothered me that 'lameness' got a new meaning when seeing-while-being- blind was considered a superpower, but oh jigglyss how hard it hits me now. In your face. And even harder since there is hardly anything else going on. One can suffer from the stupidity the whole run time as paying closer attention won't pay out. 

I guess I should have predicted that this superhero series was aimed for teenagers who don't know better, but oh well, at least now I know.
