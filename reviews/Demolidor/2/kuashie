I cant quite get it, Why the high ratings to so many mediocre series of late. This series is of the classic example of said mediocre series that has high ratings, 8.9 to be specific.

The key ingredients to make a good series/movie was completely messed up in this series.

Let us start first with acting. Over 90% of the cast sucked at acting, with the two lead supporting actors begin th worst of the bunch. The guy playing Foggy seems just plain onset and when he gives off any emotion, it gets even bad. The one playing Karen also doesn't belong here, she needs to be in one of those teen drama series which would suit her better. Then there is Fisk, what an atrocious voice he had, i mean why cant they let him speak normally. He sounded lame whenever he spoke. The one and only actor who was doing well was the one called Leland (when he came and freed us of the boring and shitty acting), yet they tried to kill him and leave some one like Karen's actor on. What stupid directing.

Then there is the crappy plot. The series lacks any form of direction, you don't exactly know where its call leading up to. Today is this another time that, then it goes back same way again, what a bore.

Its silly to waste anymore of my holiday time on this crap. My advice, don't be like me and let the ratings fool you. You are better of not wasting your time on this crap. If you want something more interesting, you can always turn to (((Gotham))).
