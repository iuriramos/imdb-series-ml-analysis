I just saw the pilot to this series. The lighting is awful. I know that Dark is cool, but I don't think every room needs to be lit with a dim bulb hanging from the ceiling. The acting is mediocre to terrible. I don't know if it is the director, the script, or the actors, but ever bit of dialogue fails. The levity isn't light enough, Charlie fox's "superhero" soft voice is silly (due to the pauses), and the rest of the dialogue is poorly written.

The only thing this pilot (I'm not interested in seeing the rest of the series) has going for it is the fight scenes. They are well shot and the choreography is awesome. If there is any reason to see this show, it's to see some decent fight scenes.

That being said, I'm not impressed. It's CSI or House with kung fu. I hope the fans have a lot of fun and the actors get a steady job. I'm just not interested in funding it.
