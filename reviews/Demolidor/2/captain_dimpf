8.8 out of 10? Are you smegging kidding me? This is one of the worst TV series I've ever watched. What makes it so bad and unbearable, you might ask? Pointless fistfights alternate with pointless dialog. And they drag on for hours and hours. Seriously, I thought the obsession with fistfights went out with the first Star trek series and I was convinced with the latest ventures of Batman, Iron Man, Jessica Jones, to name just a few, the super hero Genre had been redefined to some degree. You know, put some humour and self irony into it. Something you won't find in Dare Devil, no matter how hard you look. Also, from very early on I wondered, why is he blind, like he doesn't seem to have any restrictions from his blindness, so there is no point for him to be blind in the first place. Sure, his hearing has been enhanced so they go for the compulsory heartbeat in every smegging episode, but otherwise fail to explain how exactly Daredevil compensates for his lost eyesight.
