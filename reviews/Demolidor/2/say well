i started skipping scenes by episode four....then got a bit interested in episode 7 and 8 and back to skipping again till the very end! God. What is IMDb rating coming to where it makes no sense to have such repetitive brainless fisticuffs in darkness being getting a rating above 5.0?? Trying to explain the sad life of the people who give this 7.0 8.0 or 9.0 is not my job, but it just gives me a feel for the low expectations they have of these series. People say OOOh marvel..aahhhh marvel,,then it must be good, ...some just live on personal feelings for the first season and just seeing people from the first series being resurrected would make them feel good enough to mark this useless second season higher than it should be marked. Pathetic. Only consolation is i may have saved an hour of my life by skipping the obvious silly dialogue. It was refreshing to see that girl's thick legs in a skirt when the season started, but soon overacting ruined it all for me. .....
