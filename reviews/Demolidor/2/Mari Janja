Characters - I'm not going to get into the Daredevil character itself, or probability of blind person seeing better than anyone - he's a superhero, so we should just get along with it, but character development is really shallow in general. It seems like writer is an alien, who lived among humans for a few years and now he's trying to explain the motivation and reasoning behind mayor choices people make - like fighting crime by getting your ass kicked because your dad was a really good guy who got his ass kicked a lot, for example. Most of the characters are one dimensional: Daredevil is tortured, the nurse is nurturing, his best friend is funny and so on. Kingpin,the shows main antagonist, is an exception - being the only character with clear motives and consistent behavior, and more sides to him than all other characters put together, seems realistic and relatable, so you end up cheering for the bad guy.

Plot line - is, basically, non-existent - there are so many plot holes I don't know where to start. Every episode is like this: Daredevil gets beaten up, nothing happens, someone else gets beaten up by Daredevil, nothing happens. Dialogues - badly written, filled with clich√©s. Again, it seems that the writer doesn't get out much, or speak with any real people, ever.

In conclusion - I would give it a 4, but it's rating is already too high. It is really, really boring - I can't stress that enough.
