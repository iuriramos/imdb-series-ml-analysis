Good fighting sequence at times. Other that that, poor story, dragged out dialogues, one of worst villains. And the plot - my 8 year old can come up with better than this. 

Yet so highly reviewed. One has to wonder why. Being a fan and purely following a hero is understandable. But no fan can succumb to this depth and compromise with seeing their favorite comic character in such a "struggling to stretch an episode series". 

Sometimes lagging and rushed at other times. The flow in this one is so ridiculous. Daredevil!!! please come and stop this madness!!!

Season 1 was enough torture. No season 2 please.
