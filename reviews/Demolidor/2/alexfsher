I was in love with the idea, however somewhat disappointing that I was gonna have to see another unoriginal superhero series. Hopefully when people see how this was butchered they might call for original ideas and some actually new content. I simply cannot get past the terrible acting in this series. Elden Henson (Foggy Nelson) himself takes six points away from the possible ten I could have given this series if it were cast correctly. Netflix has already set the standard of its shows with House of Cards, in which the casting was done perfectly. All actors perform well and fit their roles. How they could flip flop like this disappoints me. This could have truly been a great series. Now, non-salvageable.
