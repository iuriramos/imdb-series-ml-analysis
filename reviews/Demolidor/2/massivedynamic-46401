I have enjoyed all of the marvel and DC based shows.....until now. I thought the Ben Afleck Daredevil was bad but this is just painful. I cant help but wonder if the good reviews are for arrow or the flash and left here by mistake , its just bad. I started this after I finished the new episodes of agents of shield , flash , gotham , and the arrow , after the others I had great hopes for Daredevil but after 2 episodes I almost wish I was blind.........and deaf. This show might be good some day as rifftrax or mst3k fodder if mst3k comes back but as a stand alone show it does not cut it. If I can not an alternative I may be forced to actually start reading books.
