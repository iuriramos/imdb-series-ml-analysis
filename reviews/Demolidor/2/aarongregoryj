I guess I'm the odd man out, but for me this show just isn't fun. I started reading Daredevil when I was a kid in the eighties, was a few years too late for the Frank Miller stuff on the racks, but bought it all up in reprints. I even liked the old Bill Everett and Wally Wood stuff. I didn't have high expectation for the show or anything. I'll watch any comicbooky show. I like the Arrow, Flash and Gotham and all that stuff. They could all be a little better (the Flash is the best of the bunch) but I take them for what they are. However this show is just boring, and it doesn't really resemble the comic. Think of it either as a crime show that's been dumbed down with comic book elements, or a comic book show that's been muted by lame CSI type network TV tropes. I'm surprised so many people like it. It seems like the kind of compromised show that comic book fans would have been really annoyed by years ago. I'm five episodes in and Matt Murdock is still running around with a t-shirt wrapped around the top of his head for a mask. I think I read that he'll have his costume by the last episode, but why wait? Is that going to make it more plausible that he's dressed like a devil? Like I said, the show isn't any fun.
