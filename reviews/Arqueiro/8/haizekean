I started watching this show when it started and I didn't known if it was going to go well. I continued to think "Eh, it's alright." Until the end of the first season. When the story truly took off with the greatest bit of super villain acting that i have not seen in a long time. True there are many a great dc and marvel movies, but when I watched the episode "sacrifice" on arrow. I truly felt a real unveiling of a super villain. Then the second season began and i saw that this show can really become something great. If they start making super powers and even more out of this world elements. It may work. I hope more watch this show and see if it lives up to my praise.
