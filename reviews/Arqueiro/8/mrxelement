I was expecting this show to be absolutely horrible ,but I was totally wrong. Arrow has a lot of awesome fights scenes and seeing the flash-backs of how he became the Green Arrow was quite fulfilling. Couldn't believe how much Green Arrow kicked so much ass. And that's the good part that it immediately starts the Green Arrow pretty much being a badass. Also not only it shows the Green Arrow but, other cameos from the DC comic universe to spice the action and story up. Although, the writing can be a little bit dry and some of the acting can be bad sometimes,still this show will keep you entertain until the end.
