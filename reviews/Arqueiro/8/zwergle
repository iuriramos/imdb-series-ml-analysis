First time I heard about Green Arrow / Oliver Queen was in Smallville. I loved this series and just at the moment Justin Hartley came to play Arrow, I was in love. The last two seasons I only watched because of him. And then there was the plan to make Arrow to a new series. The best news ever. But, there was this little problem, Justin was not the man, they wanna make the new Arrow. At first I was really angry because of that and I didn't wanna watch the new thing. But then I saw the trailer and I thought, OK, Stephen will get his chance to proof his talent. And what can I say ? He made it.

Since the beginning I knew, why Justin never got this role. He is sweet and too cute to play this dark character they created for the new Arrow. Stephen is so good in his job and I do believe everything he say or do. Oh and Felicity, I love her. She is so funny and cute. The best friend you will every have. Also Diggle. This Guy is amazing. Oliver will never have a better friend than him.

I loved the first and the second season. The third was not really my thing. There were a lot of stories I didn't liked. So I hope season 4 will be better again.
