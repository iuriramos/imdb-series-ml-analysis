It is not the best show on TV (that takes a LOT for me to rate something best), but darned good. It draws you in, is intense, intelligent, and gives lots of plot twists. Characters are believable, have flaws, and epic like in any super-hero universe. They go a long way to make it seem "realistic" - which I like if it's done well. My pet peeve, as a computer expert, is the computer feats are still squarely in the realm of science fiction, but that's OK - it's not overdone too much. (I wonder how much Microsoft paid for their Surface product placement?)

Definitely worth watching, but beware - if you do, you will have to watch the whole thing or you won't be able to sleep at night!
