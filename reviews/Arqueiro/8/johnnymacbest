CW's new superhero show, "Arrow" superbly sets up the tone of the series; away from the glitzy version of Green Arrow from "Smallville" and instead, casts its hero in a more realistic universe ala Nolan's Batman series. Strong plotting and character building is at the core of this show along with some really impressive action sequences as we see Green Arrow set up the groundwork fighting crime and bringing justice to those who deserve it.

I'll admit I wasn't really familiar with Green Arrow, aside from reading a few comics, seeing various appearances in animated form like the Superman and Justice League animated series as well as the "Smallville" version of the character which was nice. But this new take on the character feels real and I liked it, a lot. A more emotional side of the character is what draws viewers in and that works well for most things. It's only Oliver Queen's sister that feels off. The emotional aspect of her character hopefully will be improved as the show goes on, but that's only a minor gripe that I have since I'm already liking the show.

In the end, I enjoyed the show. It's really exciting to find out what happens next episode. The premiere will answer some questions as well as leave you with many, which is a good thing because with a show like this you don't want to spoil the mystery surrounding Green Arrow and his ordeal before rejoining the public eye; however much to the chagrin of some he comes into contact with. Thus so far with the pilot episode, the result was an enjoyable ride from start to finish. Here's hoping that this show has long life on the airwaves.
