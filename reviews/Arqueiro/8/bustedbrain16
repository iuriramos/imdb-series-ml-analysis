As for who I am, I started reading/collecting comics in the early 80's, my collection growing both forward and backward, and spending most of my adolescence hanging out at the local shop. With most of the characters that have seen either screen lately having 50-75 years of history behind them, I've learned to separate the "fanboy" and the viewer in me to avoid picking apart every detail, so i can enjoy the TV show/movie for what it is.

This wasn't really necessary here, as Green Arrow isn't a very far-fetched character, and more grounded in reality. Plus, they've remained true to his origin, although at time of writing, only two episodes have aired (I never judge a series by the pilot).

After CW's success with Smallville, I was fairly certain they'd have another DC comics series in the works; and when I found out it was (Green) Arrow, I was happy, but slightly disappointed Justin Hartley wouldn't be reprising the role (mostly because he'd become the face associated with it).

But once I saw the previews, I knew "pretty boy" Hartley had no business being on the show since they were going with the darker, grittier aspect of the character. Unlike other superheroes, Green Arrow isn't driven by a need for vengeance, or a moral compass; but more of a (sometimes border-line self-abusive) obsession with vindicating himself for continual shortcomings or mistakes in both of his identities, be they real, or simply a matter of his own perception.

With action scenes that re-enforce the fact he's not just a sniper with a bow, but also showcase Green Arrow's stealth, agility, and hand-to-hand expertise (as well as a few quick winks to the comic book fans already) I'm hoping the series stays around for a while, but the ratings will decide if "Arrow" has enough "green" to go.
