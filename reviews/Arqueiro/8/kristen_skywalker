For the most part I really like this series. I've watched the first two seasons so I think I have a fairly good feel for it. I like many things about this show and most of the actors do a great job portraying their character. I must say felicity is my favorite, she does the awkward honest role splendidly.

There are two things that really keep this show from perfection for me. The first is all the sex. Not that there's a lot of it, buy why oh why must Oliver sleep with every female character(barring relatives and felicity)? He's suppose to be a changed man after the island yet he still seems like billionaire playboy in this aspect. 

The second thing that just bugs me is the portrayal of black canary. First off it's kind of confusing who canary is. Canarys name, Dinah, is given to Mrs lance who definitely can't be canary. Which leaves the two girls laurel and Sarah. Laurel bugs the heck out of me but seems to be Oliver's "favorite". Sarah has the martial art skills and a black outift(which is lacking the look of the comic canary outfit). The thing that really gets me though is neither of them has the canary cry. How the heck can you have black canary without her power. End rant. 

Anyway I'd recommend this show and can't wait for next season.
