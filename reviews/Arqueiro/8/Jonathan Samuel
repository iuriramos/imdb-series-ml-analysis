I noticed the featured user review gives the lowest possible rating for Arrow, claiming it to be horrible without having even watched a full episode. If it's not already obvious, please learn to ignore trolls with no sense of reason.

Like all good CW shows, Arrow builds with each new episode, becoming better, more engaging, more curious. There are a few filler episodes here and there, but unlike more conventional television, Arrow has two main stories that play out as the first season progresses. There is the present-day storyline, where we watch Queen do his vigilante thing, but we also get to see flashbacks to five years past, where, while stranded on an island inhabited by dangerous and mysterious hostiles, a younger Oliver is forged into a formidable warrior. There are mysteries being revealed in both present events as well as in the flashbacks, and at some point these mysteries will be explained, and possibly even intersect in some way. So far, this first season has weaved the narrative well, and created some fairly thick suspense that holds the viewers attention.

Arrow works well by grounding itself in reality. There are no meta-humans to be seen, only normal people who have honed their skills to achieve great things. There are relationships and character development at work here that make the show interesting to watch regardless of the action. Saying this, however, the action is still what Arrow does best. Fights are fast and brutal, and really well choreographed. It's not just how the fights play out either, but who the players are, and the heroes and villains seen in the first season are all worth watching for.

Give Arrow a try, maybe by watching an episode deeper into the first season. For a slow-burner, it's already burning with a fierce intensity, so we'll probably see it come into a league of its own by the end of this season.
