When I first began watching Arrow, I thought it was essentially a superhero soap opera. If they re-did the first season with Latin American actors, it would become an instant telenovela success on Telemundo. I was ready to rate Arrow 6 out of 10 stars initially for the excessive gimmicks seen in season one.

But season two absolutely blew me away. You could definitely tell how much the show as a whole evolved just after watching a few episodes. The story, characters as well as character development, and plot were incredibly well-written. It almost felt like I was watching an entirely different show. Season two was so well done that it earned the show an overall 8 out of 10 from me, and I sincerely hope they remain consistent going into season three.
