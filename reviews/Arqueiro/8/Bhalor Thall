OK guys, this my first post, so bear with me for a moment and be patient. Most of the negativity toward this series comes from the beginning of the show. Later on, it gets more over the characters motivations and background. there's no black and withe pictured as blunt of most of the Super hero theme goes. If you go over the layers of superficial good looking actors and actresses or the wealth of the families to lure some of the superficial folks all over the world you could see a deep plot, well written and properly set during the show duration so far. All the troubles that the Arrow dude goes trough are easy to connect with if you are willing to. And his motivations and the island period are a very nice twist to the show. that said, I think it has lots of potential to success over the last Super hero TV shows we had in the past, some one remembers Smallville? There's a good reason behind the motivations and there's lots of consequences after their choices are made. So bear with the show after the first 5 episodes, you will not be disappointed.
