OK, so we've seen this sort of thing before - multi-billionaire suffers a crisis and comes back as a hard as nails vigilante to defend his city (Batman anyone...) but what people seem to be failing to recognise is that this is based on a comic book from DC Comics. So the acting isn't fantastic, the lead character manages about two facial expressions an episode, and the CGI effects aren't brilliant but at the end of the day it is a show you can sit and watch without having to concentrate too much, it provides 45 minutes of entertainment and to be fair I find it pretty entertaining.

People are saying that it isn't realistic, or how does he suddenly have access to gadgets that can break super secret computer firewalls when he is purely a kid etc etc. If you want realism, watch a documentary. This is a work of fiction, based on some drawings for kids. Stop questioning the laws of physics, reality or common sense, sit back and enjoy the show.
