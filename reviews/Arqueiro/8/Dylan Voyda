As a long running fan of the character I was dreading this series. It didn't look that good and I was worried that it would betray the character.

The more I thought about that point the more one thing entered my head. Green Arrow originally was at its best a Batman knock off, and making the character in a dark, more realistic world would be the perfect use for the character.

I like this new take on Green Arrow largely because unlike many of DC other main characters the supporting cast of Green Arrow has always been a little up in the air, and it gives a new way to look in the character.

As long as Dinah Lance becomes Black Canary at some point (even if she does not have powers). I think I will be able to enjoy Arrow for some time.
