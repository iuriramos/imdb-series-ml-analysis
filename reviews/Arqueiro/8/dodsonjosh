I really like this show, the first season was really entertaining and ended great! I really enjoy the contrast between the events happening during his time off and on the island.

My dislike of this show stems from the really terrible teeny bop music they play during "Emotional" moments in the show, I feel like doing this kills a lot of good shows, as a 28 year old male who still loves super heroes.....I just don't need teeny bop music to be playing during my shows it kills it for me.

Get rid of the crap music and replace it with some strong classical pieces that help bring the emotion you want the audience to feel closer than this crap...Half the time I skip through the parts with the cheese music.

Highly recommended for those who enjoy super heroes, action, enjoyable story and strong characters.
