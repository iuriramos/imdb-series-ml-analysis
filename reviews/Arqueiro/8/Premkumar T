I'm personally huge fan of superheroes, esp Batman, Spiderman. Arrow takes a lot from both the superheroes I love. Stephen Amel's physic , agility & training makes the Green Arrow more believable than any other superhero.. By far he is the best fit to portray a superhero!!!

Although the show has loopholes I'm fine with it!!! Mystery - Check; Cool tech - Check ; Double life - Check Romance - Check Action - Check; Thrill - Check ; Storyline - Needs more effort from the script writers; Depth of character - A lot to be desired!!

On the whole the show is brilliant. Laurel is a beauty. Felicity & Dig are awesome. Looking forward for some more interesting plots..
