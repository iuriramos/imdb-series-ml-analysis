I loved this show right from the beginning.on the first two seasons they related everything happens in the present with the story happened in the past.the action sequences are the best ones in the show.but some episodes feel like seeing the same things over and over but you will love the characters and the cast is so damn good.this is one of the best ones from DC.

season 3 is not up to the expectations but however they managed to wind up the story line in a path and end it.

If you guys wanted a good action flick and don't really care about the story a lot,this is a perfect show.
