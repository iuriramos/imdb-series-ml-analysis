I have to say, in the first few episodes of this new show I was sceptical. I thought the way that Oliver was being treated when he returned after 5 years on an island, was somewhat unrealistic, and the acting wasn't that good.

Now that I'm advancing through the episodes, my view has changed. I really like the story and after every episode I almost can't wait until the next one airs. There's always a great cliffhanger which makes me want to see the next episode. Also, the flashbacks he has to his time on the island are really cool. every time one of his flashbacks end, I wanna know more about what happened to him on that island. 

Conclusion:

I got really involved in the story and with all the characters which makes me want to see more after each episode (Also, I really like bow and arrows). Definitely worth watching!
