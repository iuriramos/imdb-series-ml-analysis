Based on the DC comic book character Green Arrow, the show is an adventure/action series developed by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg.

Billionaire playboy Oliver Queen (portrayed by the obscenely handsome Stephen Amell)returns home having spent the last five years stranded on an uncharted island to find his city in all manner of criminal disarray and wanton corruption. This will never do. And so, the once irresponsible lothario sets about on a campaign of righting the wrongs of the nefarious town that was once his playground, targeting the key miscreants that are responsible. Using a mixture of Parkour, practical martial arts and a exceptional talent for the bow and arrow - not to mention of course his limitless flow of disposable funds, he begins to target the shady figures he deems accountable and subjects them to some vigilante style justice.

This show is great! The story is fantastic, and the layers are deep and plentiful - from the ongoing flashback sequences detailing Olivers time spent as a castaway to the clandestine figures and the obligatory love interest with whom he must redeem himself. The production values are incredible, the show runs at a breakneck pace and boredom would only be a problem for those suffering from the most crippling form of ADHD. The action is superbly choreographed - as indeed are the fight scenes that are indicative of our desire to see a more believable style of on screen fisticuffs. The tone of the show is rather camp, but that's to be expected, as is the acting but not to the degree of overkill. The first episode left me very eager to see the next and so much is set up within the first show - without becoming convoluted, that I couldn't wait to see how it all pans out. Such good fun - lighthearted yet dark in places, this shows appeal will stretch far beyond that of a comic nerd demographic and thankfully has been picked up for a full season.
