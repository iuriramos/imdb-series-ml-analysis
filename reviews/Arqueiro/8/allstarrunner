When I first saw the previews for this film, I was very excited for a darker, vigilante type show. Well, it isn't as dark and thought provoking as I would have liked, but that was just my own expectations. You will NOT like this show if you are one of those people who needs everything to be realistic; but, if you are someone who doesn't mind having your brain "look the other direction" every now and then for the sake of realism and slightly cheesy acting and plot lines, then there is a decent chance you will like the show a lot. It is basically a combination of Robin Hood and Batman; the story line so far has some pretty good promise and I look forward to watching more episodes. But again, it is a CW production, not a major motion picture production, as long as you can keep that in mind, I think you will enjoy it a lot.

Edit on 9/19/2014: This has actually turned out to be a fantastic show; one of the best on television. The characters are well developed and there are real consequences the good guys have to deal with; very good show!
