The only one thing that pisses me up every single time when i watch the series, and I do watch them all because other this problem the series itself is watchable.

What's with the masks? Wouldn't you recognize your own sister or brother who is wearing nothing but a cloth over her/his eyes?! i mean Sarah talks funny and has a distinguishing chin mark and accentuates funny as well. Don't get me started with Queen! The chap is always with a beard thing just like when he is not the arrow and has that very distinguishing mole next to his lower lip! He is talking in broad daylight with everybody wearing a hood with his eyes covered, with the beard + the mark on his chin! 

I just find this hilarious, no effort put in to over think this matter and have them wear a proper disguise! I just feel silly whenever I see the Heroes talking to their families and nobody can recognize them, obviously the script won't allow them but normally you would of course recognize them entirely! Silly silly silly.
