This show is absolutely excellent. The story lines are interesting and involving, the characters are well developed, and all in all its just a must watch for DC fans. However there is one massive issue. Laurel. She is a whiny, overacting, pathetic, weak willed, narcissistic, selfish, egotistical, manipulative, useless, inconsiderate, disrespectful and just generally awful character. 

I simply cannot stress how much she worsens this absolutely fantastic program. So I warn viewers - please continue to watch the show and to battle through her whinging. 

Even as the canary she is just the most feeble and naff vigilante/hero. Sara was kick ass! And then Laurel took 2 weeks of boxing classes, cut a mask out of a cereal box, decided to become a hero to "avenge Sara blah blah blah" and proceeded to become even more of a liability to the main team. The gimmicky canary scream just worsens the case. Every single fight scene is simply Laurel running in, making a stupid face and screeching like a canary before being subsequently battered and chucked aside like a soggy piece of bog roll. Deservedly so. 

In the comics she was shown as a strong and independent woman! Yet in this she is portrayed as a desperate, needy, over-demanding cow.
