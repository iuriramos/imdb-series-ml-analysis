I have just finished the fourth season of arrow and I had a thoroughly enjoyable time with the season. The premise of the season sees oliver queen and felicity return to star city to attempt to stop Damien dhark and his army of ghosts from destroying the city. Stephen amell returns as oliver queen and he is so good in this role, he really brings humanity to this character and makes him way more interesting then his comic book counterpart. He is great in all the action scenes and adds a bit more humour to the role this season. Diggle is back and he has a larger role this season as he takes a bigger role this season adding a lot of drama to the show. Thea is now full speedie this season and she does a good job especially at the beginning of the season where she tries to get over the events of last season. Neal McDonough plays damien dhark and he seems to relish being a bad guy in this show that is more unique and does have depth to his character. However, there were a few performances I didn't really enjoy. Felicity was a fan favourite character in the first few seasons but since season 3 she has become quite annoying and a character that really feels forced down our throats by the showrunners. Also now laurel became the black canary last season but she isn't given anything to do for the majority of this season and that is disappointing. The story of the main story is pretty interesting with team arrow taking on a new threat in magic which felt pretty unique. Also there were allot of good character stories this season. However, just like last season the flashbacks are an absolute waste of time and feel like they are holding the show back. The script has some good drama and the humour seemed more appropriate this season. The style is great again, with all the action scenes being fantastic to watch and flowing very well. Overall once again this is a really good season and I'm excited for season 5.
