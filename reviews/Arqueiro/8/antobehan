O No not another Batman rip off.After watching the pilot and sticking with the show the similarities are identical,but i cant help myself from enjoying what this show has to offer.As a big fan of Batman and having to contend with films far and few between,Arrow is a show that fills the void in between. The story and caricatures are nicely done with big budget action scenes.Each episode ends with a cliffhanger of sorts something that hero based shows lacked since the days of the Batman TV show.I was surprised to read some of the negative reviews here regarding the show.I my opinion i wouldn't let this influence your decision to watch what could be a really great show.Lets hope the writers continue to delve into the story behind his skills and the mysterious Island he returned from. 8/10
