I just finished watching the first season, and I can already see this is going to be my guilty pleasure for the next few years. The main plot of the show is AWESOME! Seeing the pilot, I thought it's going to be Batman meets Dexter meets Smallwille and that it's going to have a pattern for every episode, and I was surprised how easily I got hooked. The subplots were great, too! Except the romantic ones, those were just too cheesy. On the other hand, the characters are AWFUL. Every single character is a poorly written clich√©. And every single one of them is more than often an asshole, especially to Oliver (the main), which makes him the only one with who we can sympathize. Luckily enough, he is one of the better things of the series. Actually, my favorite character was Helena Bertinelli, who appeared in only 3 episodes. (By the way, the Huntress deserves a show of her own) Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen is, um, strange. The character of Oliver is so complicated, I honestly didn't know if Amell was a really good actor, or a really bad one. I am leaning towards the first option. The other performances were very good. Except Paul Blackthorne as Quentin Lance, he's so bad, he made me laugh every time he spoke. I probably have a million other things to say, so I'll probably edit this when I gather my impressions. All in all, Arrow fun show I enjoyed watching. Looking forward to season 2.
