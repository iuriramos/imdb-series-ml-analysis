Great series, but one remark. There are a few moments where Oliver speaks Russian. Guys, that's not Russian, believe me, it's my native language. If they hadn't warn, I'd never think they speak Russian. You know, more than one million people, who use Russian as first language at homes, is live in the USA and Canada, a lot of them in California, Washington  not far from Hollywood and British Columbia. I wish producers could ask any of them how to correctly pronounce those ten words without sounding like chewing something. It would make the series more convincing.

And that tradition to drink vodka at first meeting  they are kidding you  it never happens under such circumstances. Imagine, two Americans meet in Russia and drink up in honor of that a bottle of Coke, it sucks.
