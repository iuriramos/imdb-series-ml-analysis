Its both sad and rather ironic that after decades trying to distance Green Arrow from his status as nothing more than a Batman clone; DC has, through the Arrow series managed to make him more of a Batman clone than ever before. The arrow cave, the dark and gritty, that every major enemies he faces is a main Batman villain (or Nightwing villain). Culiminating ultimately in them taking some of the most defining events in the Batman comics such as the offer of the demon and giving them to Oliver Queen.

Arrow is a great series, but it is beginning to really suffer due to their attempts to make the Arrow the new Batman.
