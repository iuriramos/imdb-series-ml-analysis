First off let's be honest, this is a replacement for the long running Smallville. That being said... I like this series better all ready, it has better action ( a little park-our here and there, which is awesome) Katie Cassidy ;) and of course the Luther mansion from Smallville and X2 doubling here as the Queen mansion, and the actors do a great job. I just hope the series doesn't get get to formulaic as the weeks go on. I hope they can evolve the series to incorporate some bigger story arcs, I'm not too current on the Green Arrow comics but I am enjoying the island flashbacks... it's that part of the series I look forward to seeing every week! WHO OR WHAT WAS ON THAT ISLAND WITH OLIVER AND THE Asian DUDE!

Overall a solid option on Wednesday night.
