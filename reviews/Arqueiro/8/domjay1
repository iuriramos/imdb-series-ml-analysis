I suspect many of the negative reviews are from comic fanboys who are enraged that the show doesn't fit their preconceived ideas of what you a Green 'Arrow' show should be. The hallmark of the obsessed fan is clear in the slightly nonsensical and over- emotional reviews.

This is not a typical superhero show, placing much greater emphasis on the characters' psychology and private lives. It appears that emotions and psychology are beyond the understanding of those who only appreciate 'wham-bam' action. 

Take, for instance, the current highest rated review by 'The_Captain5'. He completely misses the point that Oliver's deadpan response to hearing of Tommy's relationship with Laurel is not bad acting (or writing) but deliberately scripted as an indication of his emotional coldness and scarred psyche as a result of being on the island. And who says Tommy is a comic sidekick? You are criticising the show for NOT conforming to stereotype? 

It is not the Royal Shakespeare Company but I don't see the bad acting claimed by other reviewers. Instead I see a superhero show bravely trying to be different.
