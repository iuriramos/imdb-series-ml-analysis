To be honest, the first half of season one was slow, but after that, this has become one of my favourite t.v. shows to date. It's stories are strong, characters interesting, (except Moria and Thea and thanks for offing her at the end of season 2 Slade) and some of the awesomest action sequences this side of The Walking Dead! If you don't know a lot about the comic story lines published by DC, that's no issue. They don't really follow any stories from the comics which is my only real complaint. Anyhow, this show is awesome and you should check it out! It's entertaining in all the right ways that a superhero show should be. I can't wait for it to return.
