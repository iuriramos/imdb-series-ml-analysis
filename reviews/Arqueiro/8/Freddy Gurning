As a huge DC fan, Arrow brought to life the story of one of the most underrated comic book characters. Oliver Queen and his adventures as Green Arrow has always lingered around issues concerning the human emotion (similar to The Dark Knight, thus the wide public interest in Arrow). In this case, the pilot episode has built a more-than-solid foundation for Arrow to undoubtedly hit it's 'mark' during it's d√©but season.

Never-mind the 'hacking-arrow' scene towards the last part of the pilot episode (though it was definitely a b*ner-killer), and the fact that Speedy is Oliver's sister in Arrow. The only speck in an otherwise great pilot episode is Oliver Queen himself, played by Stephen Amell. 

Though his portrayal of Oliver Queen was intriguing, a couple of things (such as the eye-flutter after he supposedly 'fainted' during his break- in at Hunt's office) has made me personally uneasy when talking about the integrity of the show. If the pilot episode is a reflection of what is to be expected of the first season, then I will personally be very disappointed. It is clear that the attention to detail must be improved if Arrow is to fulfill it's potential as a great show. Despite all the hiccups, Arrow certainly has the legs to make it for a second or even third season (and that's just by looking at the pilot episode).

Otherwise, I can only hope that the show gets better as the season unfolds.
