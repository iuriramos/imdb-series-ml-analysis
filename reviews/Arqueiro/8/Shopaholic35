Arrow is a good live-action superhero show. Seems slightly unrealistic but what show about superheroes is ever completely believable. It feels like a fairly dark show but is nevertheless compelling. After each episode I keep wanting more.

Super happy to see Willa Holland and Katie Cassidy back on TV after their respective shows ended. They're great young actresses with lots of style and beauty. As for the man-candy, Stephen Amell does a great job at portraying the sexy billionaire playboy Oliver Queen who sets out on a mission to clean up the city. Two words "Totally Hot!"

There is a big budget movie feel to the show but it is completely necessary to tell the story. It's a very solid addition to the superhero action genre.
