I know a lot of people are currently reviewing the entire show of this to be some ridiculous TV show that has some no interest of anyone over the age of 12, but, I'm 25 and due to the fact that a majority of all TV shows now on-air currently are using DC Universe and Marvel I EXCEPTED change from the Comic Books to the TV show. Everyone is in a high-horse due to this chance, but IT has to be different to fit, because a comic book is only a 5 minute read which is only a 1-minute TV show.

The acting in this is fine, you don't have to be a person which has some stupid hypocritical state to be bother by it. If there is anything in this TV show that has to bother you, like it has bothered me is the actions scenes that do not reflect other scenes that have happened.

Such as broken glass in a van or the bodies that fall to the ground in one position and end up different in the next scene.

If you're looking for a DC comic TV show, then you're safe to watch this without anything going bad for you. If you've read the comics you'll find some familiarity but not all. Same goes for The Flash.
