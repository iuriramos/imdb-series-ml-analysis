This TV series amazed me,but at first i thought it was just about shooting with arrows,but later intrigued me a lot. Much less is spoken but acted and to this,it makes a viewer engrossed rather than to try to listen the story line. 

The down side of this piece of art is the fact that never in anywhere will an arrow shooter be sharper and lethal in reaction to someone with m14 or a revolver. i like the switches that the writer makes between the scenes,as of the live of the Oliver Queen at the island jungle and the recent life of civilization.

the relationship among the character are perfect though there is no concrete base for such relations. the concept of this writer is good,though it needs some further dramatic ideas or transition to avoid the so long lists of Oliver's targets.
