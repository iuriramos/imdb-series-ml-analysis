If you want to watch something entertaining, captivating and exciting then you must watch this. But keep in mind this show does not fully satisfy the most solid-reasoning demanding minds because there are events lacking logical explanations that make this show somewhat inconsistent.

If it was not for these flaws, I would admire this show more, but even so this is worth the opportunity to be watched for one or two episodes to make your own opinion.

The acting is good, not great but delivers what is supposed to. However, the actresses involved in fights should be more fit if we are expected to give more credibility.

Most of the fighting moves are better than for example Daredevil (which is quite great overall) but there are still some moves that need to be practiced more.

Production is OK for the budget but I would like to see more realistic explosions not those Power-Rangers-like sparks.

I want to recognize and thank the writers and everybody involved in this show because I think it is not easy to entertain us watchers for 4 seasons so far and have good ratings.
