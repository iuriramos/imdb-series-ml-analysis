While watching the first series of Arrow I noticed how many vigilante story clichés there are in it. I won't name any because I will give it away. However the majority of these clichés are played in a slightly different way which does not make them annoying to watch. The actors all do good jobs, I have not come across a character I've disliked yet, although no extremely lovable characters have yet, the closest being the original bodyguard. The script isn't as realistic as some other shows, it doesn't sound truly natural, but not to an annoying point. Also this version of Green Arrow is very much like Batman, no real wisecracks from our hero, just intimidation and darkness, although with the backstory given these would be somewhat out of place. The story is intriguing, and always keeps me interested, it really is a fantastic take on the Green Arrow story. Finally, what I adore about this show which puts it up to a 9, the action sequences are fantastic, when Arrow is Arrow something awesome always happens, and the costume is fantastic. The fight scenes are all very tense and I really enjoy watching them. I recommend this show as it is enjoyable and provides an interesting story. But not before you check out Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones, even if you are a DC comics fan like myself.
