I'm not typically a fan of the action hero genre. Its often saccharine and predictable with shallow characterization. Which is why I was genuinely surprised and pleased to find Arrow broke the mould.

Arrow follows the action hero formula but its a more mature mix. The key characters are well rounded with strengths and weaknesses found in real people. They face familiar decisions too, that often have no good answers or perfect outcomes. Its this depth of characterization and the sense of being in a believable, imperfect world, that really sets this series apart from the rest of the action hero crowd.

The acting is solid too and the plot development reasonably engaging, helping to bring the series to life.

Eight out of ten from me.
