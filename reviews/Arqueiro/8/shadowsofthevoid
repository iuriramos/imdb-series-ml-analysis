I have to say I enjoyed this show. I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. I'm somewhat familiar with the hero genre and I felt I had to say that the storyline is completely derivative. The orphan (so to speak) rising up to tackle a corrupt city with his billions of dollars and secret lair is pretty much ripped right from Batman. Even the fact that Oliver returns from the dead to reclaim his billions and clean up the streets of said city feels ripped from Nolan's first batman film.

The character Oliver feels to me like Batman who sort of splashed himself with a touch of hawkeye and robin hood. But other than these plot similarities I was pleasantly surprised with this show.

The writing, even if they are treading on roads much traveled, is done well enough as to give a fresh take on these roads. The characters are strong, if typical. I mean his sister is a very typical teenager in American TV shows. The action sequences were what sold this for me. They aren't dumbed down for families. They are gritty, flowing and while a bit over the top (I couldn't help but think how does a rich playboy stuck on an island alone for five years learn moves like that) it works. The acting is sufficient that it ties it all together.

Is this show the next great thing? No. Will I come back for more ... absolutely. It fills a nice hole in the sci fi/fantasy/hero genre that is missing currently and does it well. However I see this show going the way of firefly should their be another writer's strike as it will really only appeal to those who are comic book fans or women who want a bit of eye candy. Or worse, failing in its first season. I hope they can introduce a few new hooks that will keep the audience there, maybe widen it a bit and keep this going for a few more seasons yet.
