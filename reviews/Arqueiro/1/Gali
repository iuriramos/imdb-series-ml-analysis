Started out great, season 1 and season 2 were so good, I was so excited for season 3 but it was simply disappointing.

Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse season 4 came out and proved me wrong. This show needs to be canceled. From a great superheroes show it became a cheesy boring soap opera that makes me wanna puke every time I watch it.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this show. It's not even worth the first two season since it went downhill so badly. Thinking how great it was and how lame it is now makes me wanna cry, if I knew how bad its going to get I wouldn't have even started it in the first place.
