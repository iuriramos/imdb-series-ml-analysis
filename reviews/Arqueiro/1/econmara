The main actor is as wooden as they come and looks ridiculous in every scene. After the opening few seconds i knew it was going to be awful, I saw a bad explosion effect and a man wearing a silly looking hood and an obviously fake beard. In fact, everyone looks ridiculous with bad make up and lighting. The writing is painfully dull, any attempts at humor are mind bogglingly unfunny. The main character is highly unlikable and it is difficult to find anything with which to identify. The director seems to have done nothing but point the camera in the right direction as there is no flair or artistry evident. How does this have a high review I just can't understand it.
