This series is so overrated , it crap , s**t p**p , so here my review I want to love Arrow, I really do.

Green Arrow has always been one of my favorite DC heroes, and I'm thrilled that he's got his own very successful TV show which, to be fair, is a damn sight better than it might have been. But that doesn't mean that it's as good as it should be.

My relationship with the show has run hot and cold. I watched the first seven episodes and quit. Later, during the second season, several friends recommended I give it another try, reassuring me it had gotten a lot better, so I went back and watched everything from the point I'd stopped. And I was glad I did, because it was getting better, and by the end of second season, it was pretty great. I went into the third season excited to see what the show's creators would do next, and then things got painful.

Eleven episodes in, basically halfway through the season, I quit again. That was several weeks ago, and this week I decided to give it another chance to get better again, and I've now watched up through the season's thirteenth episode, "Canaries." And it's still not must-see TV.

Before getting into what's wrong with the show, I want to mention some things that are right about itÂ…
