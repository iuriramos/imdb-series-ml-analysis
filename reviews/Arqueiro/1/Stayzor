WARNING! THIS TV-SERIES MAY COTAIN THE WORST SCENES AND ACTING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN ON SCREEN YOUR WHOLE LIFE. CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!

I have tortured myself through the first season and ended at the third episode in season 2. Arrow is so bad that I would either cut my dick off, tape it to my forehead and walk around like an unicorn a whole day, than see another episode. They copy-paste Batman, the acting is terrible, the script is toilet paper. The only good thing is the sexiness of Laurel (Katie Cassidy). How on mother earth did this series got 8.2 in rating!? It is only 0.3 behind Homeland and 0.5 behind modern family! Please god, cancel this show for the sake of the human race.
