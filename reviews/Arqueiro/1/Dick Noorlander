As the summary tells you I found this show, after seeing 11 episodes, a big disappointment. 

The main characters have absolutely no chemistry with each other and their acting is just terrible in general. I found out that after a couple of episodes I thought there was something I missed. In the intro he tells us he "becomes something else". Now since I am not a big Arrow fan, or any comics in general, I thought there must have happened something that changed him into something else like with the Hulk. But no (at least not up to this point). But more important is that there isn't any indication that they will reveal something like that has happened. That is just one small example of how awful the story-writing is. 

In my opinion a show must have got some credibility. Like in other shows and movies we tend to believe that they can do those extraordinary things but up now they have failed to let me believe anything. Perhaps it is due to the acting, lack of chemistry or the thin storyline but I assume it is because all of those things together. The only thing that is actually good about the show are the action scenes. But since they failed to let me believe anything those aren't good enough to carry the show.

all in all a terrible show and I don't expect any progress in the near future.
