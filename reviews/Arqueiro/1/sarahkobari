To be honest I do not understand how this show has such a great rating, it is the worst show I have ever watched, cheesy and stupid... Nothing original ever happens, just bunch of dramatic characters, I mean how many times will Thea cry over the same thing and do something impulsive, it happens in every episode, they should come up with a better excuse. Secondly its not sensible, 'The Hood' does not cover his face, its very obvious who he is especially when he's fighting his whole face shows so how can people not realize it, I mean if you're gong to make a show about superheroes at least make the watchers fall for it, such as batman or spiderman , all of them covered their faces its logic. Simply terrible.
