I followed this series through the first season and kept thinking, this guy (Stephen Amell)has got to get better some how. Well, that hasn't materialized. I don't think Stephen Amell could make someone think he had to defaecate if he had a box of laxatives. I I came across someone in real life with the emotion the characters display in this series I'm assume right away that they needed mental help. It's like people who didn't work out anywhere else all wound up here. Such a huge pool of bad talent.

And what's up with the mother and daughter, do they have herpes? What the hell is on their lips?(gross)
