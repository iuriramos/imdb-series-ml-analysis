I would love this show, except that it regularly gives a dose of incredibly bad "moral" lessons. The latest came with episode 15 of season 4. Felicity finds out that Oliver has a son from a previous relationship, something he didn't tell her because the birth mother demanded that he keep it a secret for everyone else, to shelter the child (William) from Oliver's tumultuous life. Oliver's been through hell and back to prove himself to his friend and his fianc√©e, and still that's not enough - she can't "marry" him. It's all Oliver's fault. He's the "bad" guy and everyone's expected to attain to a standard of perfection, that of course nobody in the show lives up to. Ridiculous. And the degree of Felicity's selfishness in all things Oliver is really quite obscene and disgusting.

Well, one less show to watch. Too much with the BS!
