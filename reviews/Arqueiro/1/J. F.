how come this crap currently has an average rating of above 8? You gotta be kidding me! The script is really bad, the acting is just so so and it's just plain boring... enough said (well, more than that, really)

minimum number of lines? This series is just not worth it. Really

Blablabla (similar to the script, I must say...) 10 lines of text? well, really? I tried to watch more than just a couple of episodes and that was painful. Isn't that enough lines yet? Well, no it seems. To cut it short: don't waste your time on teenage stereotypes, OK?

crap, still not enough lines? what would I want to waste on this series...? well, nothing, really. It just ain't worth it!
