I have no idea where are all these amazing reviews are coming from, I fell from them and watched the first episode, which is totally crap. Its a poorly made soap - with long stares and bad acting. the characters are fake, and the plot is a total rip off. My best guess is that the writers of these reviews are the "actors", their family and friends who are posting fake reviews. Do not watch this show - I want my wasted time back!
