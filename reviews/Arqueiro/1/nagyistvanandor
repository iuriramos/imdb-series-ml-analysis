DC was a one trick pony for me for a long time. I felt characters using arrows are outdated. the beginning of the series made me change my mind on both. I started to like (green)arrow. But what dc give it takes away.

Season 2 was alright, though it had its flaws in character logic's, but still hold up.

But season 3 is just bitching, bitching, whipping, bitching, bitching... and bs, lots of bs. Although credits for killing of the terrible black canary. Less credit for spending so much time whipping on her death. When Ra's "killed" Oliver... that was still a bit did they really? but soon spoiled that they did not... and it was meh, except the hole "you made me think...blah blah" following it, hitting every possible clich√© it can touch... and it just kept on and on going with Roy feeling guilty, Thea founding out the truth, wanting to kill her dad, wanting to die, feeling betrayed...ahhhh. than doing the same oh he/she "died" with Thea, Roy, the hole team. it got really stretched and terrible. 

season 3 kind feels like "we interrupt this action scene with some random bitching" and as the season progressed Bitching toked over and sometimes featured action for old time stakes.

I point out emotions don't equal bitching. If your characters rehearsal lines over and over witch every action/superhero movie/series did that's bitching, that's fake, that's annoying, that's boring. that's why i probably wont watch season 4.
