Really? That high a rating? 

This show is TERRIBLE and I watch a lot TV, as much as humanly possible, including some really-bad-but-good shows. 

I could NOT watch this show, I watched the first 20minutes and me and my friend had to turn it off it was so painfully terrible.

The cinematographer is alright, the effects are alright, but the characters are plastic dolls and the writing is so incredibly wrong for the scenario. The main character is supposed to appear stoic, but instead he just seems like his brain has been broken, robotic-idiotic.

Don't bother.
