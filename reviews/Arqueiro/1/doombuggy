As the title suggests,this show is trying much to hard to live up to other titles in the DC universe (the dark knight, smallville, and the also overrated man of steel). It is too dark and gritty that it detracts from the overall narrative. If the show were a bit more lighthearted,then maybe the 'Arrow' would character would be more tolerable. As the show continues Queen's back story just seems more and more contrived, and begins to lack purpose. The abundance of the flashbacks per episode also gets to be distracting. The only character on the show who isn't completely one directional is Felicity. She lights up any scene she's in and makes the show a bit brighter which I feel it needs more of. However those are short lived, and quickly dismissed by testosterone filled fight sequences that are difficult to see because again it's too dark. If the show stopped trying to take itself so seriously like a drama and more like a comic book series, then it would a much better and enjoyable show.
