I'll just say what has already been said. Weakly written characters. Weakly acted characters. Exaggerated reactions to everything. The words nuance, range and depth seem lost on whoever is choosing the final scripts. Bad music and badly timed music. Inane dialog. Occasionally good action and even that dwindled by the 10th episode. I have also ended up skipping through parts that seem so soap operaish which comprises about 70% of each episode. I don't claim at all to know the effort it takes to write good characters or even more difficult inter-character relationships but I'm sure I could have done a better job or at least decided to stop writing.
