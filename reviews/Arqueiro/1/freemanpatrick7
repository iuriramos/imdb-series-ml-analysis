I'm not a fan of Comic Book heroes and wasn't even familiar with the character before I noticed the pilot listed on TV. I'm down to only two hours of television per week (I can't handle any more than that) and thought it might be nice to see something new. And it would be nice - if there ever was anything new.

I made myself sit through the whole pilot, which, by today's standards equals about 40 minutes of programming and 20 minutes of commercials. Long before it was over I found myself asking a familiar question: Does it cost less to produce crap than it does to produce quality.

Remember when the commercials during the Superbowl were all funny? Maybe some of you aren't that old but, believe me, it's true. They used to be funny. Why aren't all commercials funny? Does it cost less to produce stupid commercials? I wonder.

TV shows used to be creative, technical, artistic and dramatic. A few of them still are. OK, maybe two of them still are. The rest are crap. Does it cost less to produce crap?

I have to admit that my expectations of any new show aren't very high. But Arrow, like so many other shows today, fall so far short it's laughable. Let's not talk about the OH, COME ON! situations. Like, how does a guy come back from a 5 year absence to a lair set up and running with the latest computer technology waiting for his return. Think about how much technology has changed in the last 5 years. 

How does the hero's friend secure a venue for a party at the last minute that just happens to be right across the street from the bad guy's office? 

And how do people who can't act, can't write and can't direct get jobs in TV anyways? Is the golden age of television really gone?
