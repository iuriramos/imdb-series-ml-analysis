This show drives me insane. I don't know anything at all about the comic book character, but this show is just worthless. I realize that superhero shows come with a lot of unrealistic ideology, but this show is like a never ending progressive/socialist propaganda machine. Seriously every episode drops not so subtle hints about the evil rich people screwing over poor people all the time and how the corruption is simply because of all these horrible "one percenters" just sitting around being greedy and keeping the little guy down. It's like watching a soap opera written by a bunch of Detroit high school drop outs who can't understand why they shouldn't just have everything handed to them. I thought the flash was apretty cheesy, but this show makes it look like it has the quality of TWD. On top of it all, you have crappy acting and ridiculous action sequences. Horrible horrible horrible show. Avoid at all costs. I can't believe it got such high reviews. Go watch daredevil on Netflix to get your superhero fix and leave this show to die off.
