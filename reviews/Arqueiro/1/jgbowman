Wow, talk about the most misrepresented show on television, Arrow purports to be an action/adventure show about a super-hero. In reality, it is as far from that as possible. The movie Annie has more action and adventure than Arrow.

If this show has been recommended to you, then I hope you are a fan of melodrama. I call this show Arrow 90210. Taking out the commercials, you are left with about 35 mins of tiresomely boring melodrama between the relatives and friends of Arrow and about 5 mins of action. I was really excited to watch this show. I am a fan of the comic book and I liked the proposed changes to make the character more modern.

When I saw the pilot I thought it was interesting. The whole subplot (no spoilers in this review) was intriguing and the show overall was interesting. I did find the central character a bit lacking in the acting department (is that guy a robot? Have they updated his emotional responses yet?) and the drama between the family and friends overly long and tiresome. I still thought it had potential.

Much to my chagrin, the tiresome drama was quickly extended through each episode and the subplot and action downgraded accordingly. By the fourth episode, I was bored, I turned it off. I absolutely could not watch any further. I found that I didn't care at all about the feelings or relationships of the characters, and if the villain ever showed up (dont blink or you'll miss him) I was rooting for him to win.
