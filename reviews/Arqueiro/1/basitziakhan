I cannot put in words how awful this show has gotten. It started of so well in season 1, carried on being great till season 3 and I loved it. Now it's gotten to a point where I actually started to hate it and I just want it to end.

If you are already watching this show and did not make it past season 3, you might as well just start watching My Little Pony after season 3 because the Arrow we all knew has died, and so has the purpose of the whole series. This show is ruined, and so will be your life if you ever decide to watch season 4

I cannot take it anymore

PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!!!
