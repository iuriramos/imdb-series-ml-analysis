WTH? 8.0? For what? Camera shakes consistently like it is a found footage movie. The action and acting is the worst. Like watching them over act. Stone wall acting. Anything on CW is towards the younger people, like teenagers and 20 something.

I loved Supernatural until they totally went religious on the show to fight the demons. Pretty much all the shows on CW are for the 20 something and younger audience. This is not good TV, it is just biased towards the younger generation.

The camera shaking is annoying as heck. How can people enjoy that? Unless, you are a found footage lover. Which, I am not one at all. Hate them with a passion. There are so many trailers that fool you into seeing the movie and you go to the theater to find out it is all shaky camera.

Nothing interesting about found footage at all, and to hear people say the horror movies that are found footage are scary is beyond annoying too. Nothing to watch on television except this and this is not even that good. Surprised it has lasted this long on television, but usually the crap last longer than the better stuff that gets canceled.
