Dear Oh Dear. I actually (unbelievably ) watched 2 whole seasons of this, because at first I thought it had potential, and the story was OK. I expected it to get better. It is a fantasy about a superhero, so I am happy to suspend disbelief and take it for what it's worth. But enough is enough ! The point it really lost me was not the bad acting, Beverley Hills 90210 type relationship drama or the rest of the criticisms thrown at this show. No, it lost me when EVERYONE ends up being a superhero too. Like his skinny sister who could hardly be strong enough to knock down a six year old takes martial arts lessons and after 6 months or less is an ace superhero herself beating up beefy bad guys. Then his girlfriend Laurel or whatever, ( also so skinny she could barely stand up in a strong wind, let alone get in a fight ), takes lessons at a boxing gym and after 3 months, hey presto, she becomes a masked superhero too, and is wiping the floor with bad guys. Impossible , I hear you say. No way , I hear you say. But no, the writers expect us to swallow that. Like another reviewer said, this could only appeal to 6 year olds, or people with low IQ.
