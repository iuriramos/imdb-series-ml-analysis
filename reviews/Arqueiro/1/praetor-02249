1. Okay, I'm a guy that LOVES to sleep around, but the characters in this show sleep around so much it makes the girls look like total sluts. Every time Thea or Felicity or Laurel gets to meet a new character introduced into the show, they are asked out on a date and end the date humping

2. So much inconsistency. At one point, two characters are best of friends / family and nothing on earth can break that bond, then next minute they're enemies. Seriously, I think the writers are 5 year olds on crack to write a show like this.

3. EVERYONE becomes a super hero. The main character's lover, ex- lover, sister, hell even the next door neighbor's dog becomes a super hero (okay that last one's a joke but seriously...) Is it really that easy to become a semi-invincible god like fighter? And what is up with all the female fighters? I mean I'm not sexist or anything but please at least choose women who can do the choreography right. When Laurel Lance fights... it is... absurd to say the least. You can literally see her doing the "girly girl swing" with her punches. If they chose Ronda Rousey to do the action scenes, at LEAST the fights would be memorable, but the producers messed that up too.

4. In summary, this is the most absurd, bad action, bad acting, stupidly put storyline TV show I've EVER watched, and I'ved watched TV for over 36 years, in 8 different countries.
