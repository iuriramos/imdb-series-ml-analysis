Okay so I am not one to judge TV shows. It is not hard to please me when it comes to watching TV. I watch a drastic range from the walking dead to the mentalist to family guy. I absolutely adore superheroes and can not say enough about last year movies like the avengers, dark night rises and so on. So when I wasn't feeling well tonight and decided to stay home, I found the perfect opportunity to check out this new show. My sister recommended it and I saw the commercials. The guy looked hot, it looked full of action and seemed like a fun night. The last show she recommended to me was revolution and I was not disappointed. Hmm.. what she failed to mention is that no one in this show can act. The plot is not bad if looked at it overall but each episode is so boring. There is no chemistry what so ever. I had to force myself to watch eight episodes and I quit. I was about to go to sleep when I got angry. How the heck is this show doing well? Seriously, how is that good shows get canceled that actually have great characters, plot and directing and this peace of ++++ is actually getting acclaim. Am I missing something?????
