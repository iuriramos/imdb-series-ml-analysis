The story-line - sucks The script - sucks The character depiction - pathetic; I mean a vigilante with feelings of remorse over killing the bad guys? Come on, it's either black or white never grey! How in blazes did this serial garner an 8.2 rating? To be fair, I could relate to the first few episodes. But at one point, it started to slide & I thought the whole of Starling City would end up as vigilantes. I stopped following it in the middle of Season 2. It just wasn't convincing enough to warrant my attention. The Arrow is a flop when compared to serials like the True Detective & Sons of Anarchy which are in a class of their own.
