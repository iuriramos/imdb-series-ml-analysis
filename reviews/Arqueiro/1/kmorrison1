If you liked Beverly Hills 90210, or Melrose Place, or Twilight, you will like this. Its basically a soap opera with a small super hero element thrown in. All the cast are beautiful, young actors who would be right at home on either one of those two shows. 

There's very little redeeming here--the actors give wooden performances all around as if they are just going through the motions. And for a guy who is supposed to be dark and angst ridden, the main character sure does have a big smile on his face all the time. He also looks like he just stepped out of GQ magazine. I don't know if its bad direction or what, but it is totally unconvincing that the main character has had these recent experiences.

Its really just a waste of time. The vigilante super hero thing has been done to death anyway, but this really is just bad TV. No originality..I was bored to death. Avoid at all costs.
