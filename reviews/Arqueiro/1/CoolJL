After achieving dizzying heights in season 2 everything fell apart. Admittedly season 3 wasn't too bad, but season 4 was forgettable and regrettable that I wasted so much time watching it, hoping that it'd eventually get better but that hope turned into a despair with each episode.

Put it short, what once was a crime fighting super hero show that was both fun and exciting has now been turned into as laborious ill fated love drama which seem to be intentionally catered towards girls rather than faithful fans of previous seasons. For this reason, there seem to be a trend of girls giving high ratings for the season 4, citing their love for Olicity...

If I wanted to watch self centred girls exercising girl power in the form of bossing your loved ones and accusing them at every opportunity of some ill doing and lying, then I'd watch Sex and the City. And yet this is what happens in just about every episode of Arrow season4, with Felicity being its main instigator, who is about a couple of steps away from boiling a bunny. I can understand what the writers are trying to do, create strong female character equal to Arrow, but this isn't the way to do it, they couldn't have made a worse example of it. There is no need to get into how awful the Felicity character has turned into this season, many have mentioned that already, but one cannot get away from the fact that she represents everything that is terrible about season 4.

I have no idea what's in store for season 5, but anything short of killing off Felicity will probably mean the continuation of the same drab that was the season 4, and what a shame that would be to completely ruin what once was a great show.
