The buildup to a change from a licentious rich kid to a heroic vigilante was very poorly written. The character is not believable in the least: a guy spends 5 years on a deserted island struggling for survival, yet finds enough time and resources to learn martial arts, a foreign language and acrobatics? come on... Not to mention that he somehow managed to manufacture electronically enhanced arrows and become a hacker. You call that believable? really? Besides, he wants to be a good guy and "save the city", so he starts by physically attacking his bodyguard and killing people who's only visible crime is working for a mobster. Some good values there, no doubt.

The other characters are not much better, each of them is a stereotype of some kind, not a rounded, complicated human being. 

In almost every single respect the first episode was one of the worst TV shows I've ever seen. i will not watch the second episode. Honestly, I wish I could unwatch the first one.
