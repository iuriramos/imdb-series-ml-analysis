Trying to remember this is public.. Series started as u would expect..and just went downwards.. there is so much to put the finger on..so i'm just gonna stick to Season 3 (whats came out anyway).. question 1: why does Oliver /Arrow behave like he's the only one that have been hurt/can cope with it?

2: Why does Oliver/Arrow still mean and enforce that "i'm gonna spare his life no matter what"..even though that very same person is responsible for the deaths of several thousand people (that we know of in the series)..but hey he got to make out++ with a few girls /before they died),so..

conclusion:

Series started out promising..,but Hollywood decided to please people to much (again),making it to a love-story

and Marvel-heroes ain't made for such thing :)
