I see a lot of hating on the reviews, unfortunately those were written by educated people, or by those individuals who graduated high school. There has to be show on t.v. made for people who look up to D. Trump, Palin and Ben Carson. If we only had programs like Nova, Frontline and Universe, then a lot of people would not have anything to watch, which would be unfair. To be just we have to air programming that CEO's and Wall Street bankers can understand without utterly confusing them. In this world there will always be the lesser, the slow witted as it were..politicians, ceo's , corporate legal teams for example. To deny these mentally diminished groups entertainment is unethical, and maybe immoral. That is why Arrow is great programming. It satiates the dull and dim witted with what they believe to be real life situations, to give a few examples..enlisted soldiers are wealthy, sexual tension with your sister is normal, if you think it, you can do it. With these sub plots and brilliantly stupid story lines Arrow is the masterpiece of the 'Merican' viewer. Because not having to think and the over obvious observation of ridiculous sophomoric male fantasies is a right, and a state of being for many. Basically, all I am saying is that the mentally malformed should have a haven of entertainment sanctuary and if Arrow meets the metric, who am I to deny them their dreams?
