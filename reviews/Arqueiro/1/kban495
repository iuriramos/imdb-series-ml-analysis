OK first, I'm assuming anyone who gave this series a 10 IS 10...as in years old.

2nd...wow, how can something this bad be on so long? Acting, writing...meh, not a prerequisite in the making of Arrow. Apparently, just watching and ripping off Batman Begins, (and really...a bad rip off...can't even get that right) is all that's needed.

Where to start.

Acting: Apparently good looks trump any effort to act. I'd say they were phoning it in, but really, that would imply they have another gear. They don't.

Writing: See Batman Begins....rip it off in many, many unimaginative ways.

Target audience: 10 years old and less. Is there no law that protects them from this show? Parents, do your job!

Please don't watch this show. It makes Dukes of Hazzard look Shakespearean.
