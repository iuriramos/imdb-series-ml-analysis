The show was once good, in fact it was great. The first two seasons proved that arrow was a great show and had the pointal to be even better. While there were some issues like never really showing any blood, that was just a minor detail. Now the show is garbage and should be canceled. The show started to get worse every season and is losing its way. Season 3 and 4 focused more on the side characters and his relationship then Oliver and what he does. The plot is now just plain silly and the characters and what they do is dumb. IN the season four final the enemies drop the guns that they have without using them and start a fist fight, oilver gets the whole town(that for some reason was no police or military) to help him and beat the ninja's. It is a plot a kid can come up with plus it is a end of the world scenario.
