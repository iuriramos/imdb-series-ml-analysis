I wish I have better things to say about this show. Unfortunately I have none. I won't complain too much about the execution of the badly written scripts. I have seen them before and I can stomach that to an extent. What made me throw cold water on it is its bad acting. Stephen Amell has the most inexpressive face among the guys I've seen playing the lead role. The girls who are mostly present for ornamental reasons (thanks to the writers) also manage to actively support Amell in his able job. It left me with a feel of watching a B-grade material. They had a promising start with the narrative going back and forth between the time when Ollie was marooned and Arrow fighting injustice in Star city. I guess that's all there is to it till the end or up until I watched it. The plot didn't spend time in developing any of the other characters. The lines were not bad, but none of them will ever stick with you. If one is looking for action, entertaining plot or pretty faces, it would pass.
