What is there to say? This site is filled with people who give this crap 9 or 10 for this garbage because they are invested into the program or are rating it on a scale that compares it with other garbage on TV.

Yes in the world of garbage shows, Arrow is OK.

In the world where I come from where you have Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Dexter, The Walking Dead and other 9/10, 10/10 shows, Arrow ranks as a 1.

Please anyone who gave this crappy show a 9 or 10 please write how it stacks up against the shows I just mentioned....so we all can have a good laugh.
