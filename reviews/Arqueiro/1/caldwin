This review does contain spoilers!!!!!!!!! It's was tolerable up until season for and that's when things get unrealistic and there were always stuff like that but it did't annoy me enough to stop watching it. But in season for episode 19 when they killed off laurel lance and she isn't coming back just made me really mad. I have decided i will give it one more chance but if Damian dark doesn't die I'm gonna stop watching the show for good.

They also lead a big secret to season five which I'm not even gonna watch which really annoys me and it wasn't even realistic how she died she was fine then she said something than she went into cardiac arrest and the doctor tried CPR for thirty seconds and then gave up without using the defibrillator a second time
