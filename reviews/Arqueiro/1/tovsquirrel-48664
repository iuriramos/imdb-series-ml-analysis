If it's pretty actors, some fair to poor choreographed martial arts scenes, a few big explosions, along with little acting ability shown by most of the pretty actors to accompany the beyond poor writing, this is the show for you! 

Formulaic, uninspiring and tedious are the adjectives that come to mind when I see this title.

Just plain predictable & boring.

I wanted to watch it because I was a minor fan of the comic book. I watched the whole first season in five days because I could not believe it was as bad as it is. I kept hoping that it would redeem itself, but it never did.
