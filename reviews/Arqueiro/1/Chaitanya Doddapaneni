Is it just me or this series is just going down the drain, every character is getting awfully WHINY as each episode is completed..... If it goes at the same rate, this show will probably take the honours of he WHINIEST show out there... When the show started off I thought it was just Laurel, but it was understood as almost every story out there has to have someone like that to make sure a segment of viewers stay interested. But then there was Thea.... even that was agreeable to a certain extent as she's a confused just out of teens kid. But then somehow the Lead character Oliver begins to whine about everything happening in the city is his mistake instead of doing what he was supposed to do ... WTH!!!!
