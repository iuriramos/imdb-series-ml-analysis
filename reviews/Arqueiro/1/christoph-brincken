I have been just watching some episodes from season 3. The obtrusively repeated "torture is necessary" formula makes one ask, weather the CIA is cosponsoring the series. The repeated "we are here to keep the city save from terrorism" and "torture is a necessary evil to do just that" leaves a foul taste in ones mouth. Considering it comes from a country which terrorizes the world with war while financing and training the terrorists they are claiming to fight as a pretext to invade oil rich countries, this series is a picture book of propaganda. The characters are a bit hollow too and the hero is - of course - your good neighborhood billionaire of the 0.001 percent. While real billionaires have gazillion of lobbyists doing their biding and politicians waiting in the lobby for there paycheck, this peculiar billionaire is playing with bow and arrows and is doing the torturing without CIA aid all by himself. Nice pictures for dumbed down though in the Nighted States.
