Oliver MAY NOT be dead , f**k series where the hero dies and to the half of the season . My wife and I will not watch the series if Oliver Queen not stay alive and return to the series through a maximum of two episodes so - giving time to change the scenario . Liven it in any way except for memories of other characters in the series. Oliver and Felicity have to be together and that we have not yet seen in the series. Atomic ( ant ) is Superman and that's what he needs to become in the series - if he has already put some superpowers . Now it turns out that all permanent characters in the series to become a super heroes which makes no sense .Just because the current craft shops in the series , giving the lowest rating. OLIVER BACK !!!!!!
