Did you ever have that feeling when you have invested in some form (monetarily, emotionally, physically, temporally) in something which turns out to be bad but you do it because you think it might get better and you will have a much better payoff than what you have currently! 

And the thing just keeps plummeting down until it reaches the tip off point....

The reason I won't recommend watching this show is not that I don't like( for the record I don't), but because it is just too bland ( an "ANN HOG" technically ) to feel anything.

PS- Its also f**king long. You can watch plenty of shows in any genre, even old-school, especially if you don't have time. If you have time, go sleep, do anything else, go figure
