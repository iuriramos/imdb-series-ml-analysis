After watching the first season and being addicted immediately seeing these characters going about their day and fighting crimes at night seeing to their city will be safe for another day. I've been waiting for shows like this to come out and the past year has blown apart the "T.V. scene" with superhero/vigilante's but by far Arrow has been the best one out their from day one. Going through every episode nervously watching Oliver Choose the paths laid out in front of him making him stronger and stronger every outcome that has been put on the table was probably the most addictive aspect of this show but another huge thing I can't seem to let go is the performance of each and every actor and how real they make the whole environment become, Out of the thrill, Nerves, or any other feelings I encounter while watching this show my rating would be a 10/10 any day and highly recommend anyone who hasn't watched it to start up the first episode right away!
