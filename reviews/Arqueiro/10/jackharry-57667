Arrow is one of the best shows on television at the moment. The storyline for all seasons never gets old and is very enjoyable. 10/10 show! Season 1 starts with Oliver returning from an island that he has been on for five years and he has a "quest" as you could call it to clean up his city.

Currently, with season 4 being he most recent in the series, the show is still going strong and has potential for the future. I would highly recommend this show to anyone at any age. The actors performances are amazing and the music/ visual effects are always on point. 

The show has also been very successful, with a spin off of "The Flash" which is also an amazing show and also crosses over with Arrow.

To summarize, arrow is an amazing show to watch. Period!
