I have seem most of the good shows out there and Arrow takes my first spot. From the first episode where it gives you a very good understanding of the plot and story and every single episode after, it will keep you stuck to your chair. Surprisingly fresh story line to an old tail, its not only take from the rich and give to the poor. Don't know what else to say but JUST WaTcH it !!!!! Hands down one of the MOST exciting shows i have ever seen!!! in every show there are some disappointments, but in Arrow, from the characters chosen to the story and the mire mind-blowing excitement this show should hit the top 10 chart if it hasn't already...every time I hate waiting to see what happens next and honestly it has never been the slightest bit disappointing.. just hope it doest end soon 

Great job to the creators..... Keep it up
