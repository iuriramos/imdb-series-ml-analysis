Okay, this show, the best in the world! I can never stop being a fan and the last episode, just blew me away! Seriously, why doesn't this show have a better rating? It needs to go up by at least .2 points. I got to say that I am angry because this show is beyond underrated. Like if I would have the power, I would have it at least a nine, a ten if I could. 

When I first saw the first episode, I was hooked. Like it literally captured me. The dialog was amazing, the action was even greater and it left me at a lot of questions that I just wanted to see more. Now I'm dazed like serious fan-boy dazed that I am distraught that this show doesn't have the rating it deserves. It needs to be at nine but I am not in control, please bring up awareness to increase this spectacular show's ratings. If we could raise it up by at least two points that would be great and thank you!
