Even though I absolutely love this show, Stephen Amell is a great choice for Oliver, I think it is very reminiscent of Batman. I do not like how Oliver is portrayed as a man whose womanizing is all fake, that he just does it to separate himself from The Hood/Arrow. I liked Hartley's version(Smallville) where his ladies-man attitude wasn't an act, it was apart of him. I think that being on an Island for 5 years he would want to forget about the experience, and get back to normal life, how he can't just do that, and he doesn't just lie or put up an act, he just becomes 2 separate people. While this is a good show on it's own; I can't wait for a film adaptation where this oversight is changed.
