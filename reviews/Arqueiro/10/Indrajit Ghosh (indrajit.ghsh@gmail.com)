this show literally is the reason i got my abs toned muscles of Stephen Amell with his superb acting skills and gr8t fighting sequences. superb story with regular surprises and thrilling! nothing more needed on a TV show. just the BeSt on Indian television at least !!! show has very engaging characters. past storyline sequences are quiet dark and some may even find it disturbing but it is worth it, even i would add that i enjoy it. Amell has worked very hard for his character and that reflects in the fighting scenes, he took special combat training for ARROW. finally, this show is the best show ever to be telecasted on Indian Television. thanks to star world!
