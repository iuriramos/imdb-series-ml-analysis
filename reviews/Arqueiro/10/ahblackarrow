Arrow is a good series not as fictional as the flash or as exaggerated as batman or Superman.its a really tense series and you can't even stop yourself from spoiling it I didn't like season 3 too much because it was a bit too dramatic. Season 2 and season one was the best season 4 is going to probably be like season 1 in terms of the mood. Season 1 was probably the best in terms of action two in Terms of darkness and three in teems of drama which nobody likes so Season one was the best. Fans are wondering when is oliver going to become green arrow I assure you it is season 4. So that's it and this is my favorite show. I particularly like deastroke. Scary
