Solid script is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about the series Arrow. Never in my life, have I seen a Television show involving a vigilante that has been able to pull it off as well as this. The show Arrow gives me hope that television is actually heading somewhere, from the solid script, amazing acting and cast to the ridiculously incredible action sequences that make it have the feel of a movie. The fighting sequences if you like them, are as good as the ones you would see in the frenetic action-packed Bourne movies (not the Jeremy Renner version because that one was completely terrible). Anyway, then there's the music, no action-packed anything is good or in this case amazing without a score that's sure to make you go WHOA! This show literally has it all, drama with the love situation, action with the vigilantism, sadness with the back-story as to how he becomes the vigilante, adventure with the journey this show takes you on, there is just so much. If you are looking for a show that's sure to give you a lot more than you expected, I recommend you watch it.
