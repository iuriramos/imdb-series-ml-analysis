When I first heard about this show, I'll admit that I was very excited, but never in my wildest dreams would I imagine that this show would be this perfect. From the first episode it draws you in, and until now, its only getting better and better. This show is an absolute masterpiece in every way, the writing, the acting, the environments, the drama, everything. I can without a doubt say that this is my favorite show of all time as I put it above my other favorites, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, and Supernatural. Arrow will always have a place in my heart, and I simply cannot imagine this show ever coming to an end, at least for a very long time.
