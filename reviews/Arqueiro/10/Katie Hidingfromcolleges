Not going to lie but I am a bit obsessed with this show, yet I'm not a fan of superhero based shows which is why I was hesitant at first about watching Arrow. After the first couple of episodes I couldn't stop watching, the drama, the plot, and the acting really drew me to the show. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, this is the type of show which should by on air more often. 

But I do have to say I still think they stretched out the show a bit too much meaning it took a bit longer for me to start really liking it then usually.

P.S. Burned is the best episode...just saying :D
