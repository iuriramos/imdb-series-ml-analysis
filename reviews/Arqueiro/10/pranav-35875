ARROW = AWESOME.This isn't about a superhero this is about a hero which means that he does not have any super powers like many others have . This can be seen by an adult or a teen . There are many twists and suspense s .Stephan Amell had done great stunts .This TV series is and action packed adventure one . And once again ARROW = AWESOME. Accordin to me this is the best TV Series I have ever seen. John Barrowman have also given excellent performance. Emily Bett Rickards ,without any doubt have also performed well.This is indeed an excellent TV Series for a newbie or a pro.Susanna Thompson is also given some amazing performance.
