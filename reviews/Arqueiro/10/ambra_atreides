This has easily become my favorite action series EVER! Really good acting, good script, the main character, Oliver, is perfect. I used to be watching Smallville a lot, and I liked it. But then, I was taking it as a fantasy series and allowed the non-sense. In comparison, Arrow seems just so real. Its base line is very solid and elaborated. The action, the stunts are Hollywoods level. There is just enough humor to avoid boring the spectators but not to make it look like a parody. I see a great future for Stephen Amell. He's got an amazing physique as required by the part, but he doesn't come out for a second as a male doll. His presence is way more powerful. Hope this series go a lot of seasons! A real quality show. 

20 stars out of 10!
