After watching the first 8 episodes of ARROW I stopped watching the show I thought it's complete garbage. A year after the bitter taste the show gave me I heard Barry Allen will be in the show aka the flash I got excited he was booked for 2x08 So I started watching the show from beginning, Somehow I didn't feel the bitter I get even more excited after watching another episode to another after finally catching up to the show I believe the show was in it's winter break I found myself counting the days for the next episode each week until now I do the same thing. NOW ARROW IS MY FAVOURITE SHOW!!. The show is in it 3rd season now.
