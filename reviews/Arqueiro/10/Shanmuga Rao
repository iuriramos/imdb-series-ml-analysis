Ever since we were kids we've all had our favourite superhero.. favourite comic book hero.. You want to be like them.. Its something every sane person has done and a good vigilante story is always appealing. So creating a superhero/vigilante series is a challenge all on its own. But Team Arrow does a really good job in their pilot. The Opening sequence building up to the title was brilliant.. enough lines to get you hooked.. the BG score really helped set the mood in, and once the title appears you are in. I've always believed that if a series has a good pilot with enough story to make you love and feel connected to the characters in it.. am sold!! Arrow does jus that!! no its not like this is jus bits and pieces of many cult classics we've had from Hollywood... its different in a way i cant explain.. u gotta watch it to understand!!

The entire cast does a pretty good job.. loved Paul Blackthorne's role specially!! 

Stephen Amell does a brilliant job portraying this guy who is on a mission. He switches brilliantly from being the angry and brutal "arrow" (or Green arrow.. the char he is based on) to the "before" partying billionaire playboy brilliantly which reminds me of Christian bale's performance in Nolan's masterpiece. You feel connected to him.. You want to go this journey with him. The only question is will the rest of the series live up to this?? i sure do hope so cause am sold!! Bring it on!!
