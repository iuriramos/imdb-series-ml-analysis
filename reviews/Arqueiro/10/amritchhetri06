this show exceed my expection.when i watch the pilot i knew it was going to be interesting and so it does.

the star cast is good and so is its story.its by bar the best show premiered this year.

the show is to the mark.

Stephen amell does a brilliant job portraying this guy who is on a mission. He switches brilliantly from being the angry and brutal "arrow" to the "before" partying billionaire playboy brilliantly which reminds me of Christian bale's performance in the batmen series.

no chance that u may hate this show.hope they will continue in this manner

I totally enjoyed the first episode and i can't wait for more! - 10/10
