I haven't watched a series live since literally, the first few episodes of Boston Legal. My Gwife doesn't want me playing video games, and my life, at 40, is too exciting for Ashley Madison ;) and too boring for primetime, I have to do something.

So in about a month I've watched way too many series. Repetitive themes, ailing heros, too predictable, abrupt plot changes, and not enough of an audience.

To all that, this is the best show around.

I've watched, and liked, Game of Thrones (I think the writers might only drink more than I do), Walking Dead (solid and S L O W), another of this genre Daredevil (see above repetitive themes, and although entertaining altogether Unbelievable), the Strain, House of Cards (politics is my favorite sport), and Falling Skies (I thought only a cat had 9 lives, but a better SciFi than most movies of late).

You've got good actors, good writers, a solid story, and imaginative believability, unless you've never seen what money can do, buy.

I fast forward through most TV series because they stuff the content with "fillers", not this one, best I've seen, from that stand point. Season 1 alone I can vouch for, but it's a really really goodie....
