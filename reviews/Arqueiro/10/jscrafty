In minutes I could tell I liked the style of this show. An to my surprise they got good actors too! I pick shows apart and I'm sure I'll do the same to this show BUT I was so captivated by the first 2 episodes I am promoting this show to everyone I know to check it out. 

Great job! Lets hope enough of us watch it to make it profitable enough to keep on the air.

Likes:

1. Over all look and feel of the picture. ( does it help I like green? ). 2. It's not too slow building up characters. They don't try to feed you a huge background story to explain the character to everyone. You get a little here, a little there. And not too slow too where it seems they edited out a scene that would explain it better ( like Prometheus...). 3. The actors sell their roles. Not all are equally good but good enough for great entertainment. 

Dislikes:

1. I would have expected a certain character to be already dead...but a little variation from the comic is working so far. 2. Ever see UHF with Weird Al where he makes fun of Rambo? He is 4 feet away from an enemy with an automatic weapon firing constantly yet he misses every time...then when Rambo (Al) shoots back they explode. Ya...it wasn't that bad but I think it's a little far fetched at times (it is TV...but too far fetched).
