Arrow! i watched the first episode out of curiosity but expected it to be cheesy over the top and disappointing..... I was very wrong! it is a cool entertaining action revenge series! The green arrow kicks ass and isn't afraid to kill to protect starling city! Add his bodyguard/Sidekick Diggle who adds some great scenes to an already impressive show! hope this show gets another series! 7 outta 10..... So far! Great show Good actors Some amazing action Watch this show Or arrow will find you and when he does he will kick your ass. Stephen amell is an awesome Green arrow By far better than justin hartley! No cheese with this steak haha
