Initially after seeing the pilot I was a bit skeptical. The acting was sub par and to some extent I thought the special effects were slightly cheesy. Then I watched a few more episodes and boy was I hooked. This is an excellent take on the Green Arrow, a fresh perspective on a superhero with a penchant for violence which of course is absolutely necessary when dealing with deadly criminals. There is no room for compunction no room for morality like most superheros have. Absolute justice means taking lives and mercifully the creators of the show have taken creative license and bestowed the license to kill on their green arrow. And that is where the show triumphs. Also I quite liked the way the rest of the characters are been given screen time and are being allowed to develop. It isn't only about Oliver, the show is about the choices he makes and the way it effects people around him. On the whole I am quite happy with the direction the show is taking. Lets hope it stays this way.
