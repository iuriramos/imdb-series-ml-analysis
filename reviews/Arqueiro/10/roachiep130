As for the very first review by The__Captain5, someone must have stolen his girlfriend or something, and that review is about as far from what this show is as could be found. I think ARROW is an amazing show. Well-cast, and I especially like the flashbacks to his time on the island that sheds so much information on how he changed from the billionaire playboy, waste of space he used to be into the ARROW really adds a lot of valuable layers to the story.

The multiple faces of so many of the characters. His bodyguard is a morally-driven ex soldier looking to be a part of something greater. The mother, who has deftly tried to play both sides of the game and constantly stays in danger of losing all she loves if she slips up. Couldn't believe she sacrificed her husband to go along with the plan for Starling City's future. The neverending relationship with Laurel, who in my opinion is about the most impossibly gorgeous leading-lady I have seen in quite some time. I am Katie Cassidy's biggest fan, by a long shot.
