Finally a show like this that keeps us wanting more. To be honest I was wowed from the very beginning. Excellent idea ,interesting story and a couple of good actors surely gave us something we have been waiting for. We have to admit it ,we all want to have a hero to look up to and when he by some miracle happens to look like Stephen Amell ,well then I couldn't be more happier. The show has just the right dose of humor ,mistery and romance mixed up with some pretty good action. I mean those skills and fight scenes are definitely amazing. Makes me want to start training on some desert island. I have to give credits to Stephen ,he did an amazing job here so did the Emily not just for the whole Olicity thing between them which is BTW very real and beautiful but also for the whole show. Definitely my favorite hero show from the beginning and it seems that I'm not the only one who sees that since the Arrow is getting more popular every day.

Great job !!!
