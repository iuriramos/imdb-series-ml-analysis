omfg i love this show with a passion! if I'm honest i found the first and maybe even the second episode on the boring side, but at the same time it has this draw that makes me click the next episode. being completely up to date now (the climb) i have loved the way this has been executed. although not having read the comics but extensively researching it, i found that have the right mix of sticking to the origin and also distinguishing themselves from it. i personally loved the introduction of Sara lance, and she was perfect for the role of the canary. i must admit I'm seriously unhappy that they killed her off but i hope they do not stop her appearances just yet.i really wanted to know more about Nyssa/Sara, but i have faith in the show as they really take on the fans opinions (deciding to keep Rickards as a series regular) definitely a show to watch!
