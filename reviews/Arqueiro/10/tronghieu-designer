This show have easily made it to the list of my most favorite TV shows of 2013. At first i really love the idea of a hero using bow and arrows as a choice of weapon and signature mark because robin hood was one of my childhood heroes. But thats not entirely the reason why this show has literally caught my heart. 

Simply because it differs. 

Its not merely just about action scenes with a hero hunting and fighting and kicking criminals asses in many different ways, its about the inside of a survival man once stranded on an isolated island for a hell of 5 years now came back to fulfill his promise to his passed-away dad and how he comes to resolve and reconnect with his loving family after all the long lost time. I really love how the shows chooses to center around the moral aspects between what is right and what is wrong, with the gray area that really shades your thinking of how to right the wrong. Family conflicts and responsibilities are also a huge success of the show. Lying between all the lies and a hooded cowl is the face of a man who has struggled to keep the promise to his dad to eliminate all the sources that poison his city where he grew up. That very same man also has to resolve with himself trying to find a line between hiding behind a figure to fight for what he believes in while as the same time being a responsible home-coming son, a brother who closes the distance in a broken-heart family.

Yet he longs for love, for someone who he really can share his secrets and his life.

Simly put, if you are looking for a good super hero stuff with all the actions as well as the story behind a hero, i really recommend watching this show.
