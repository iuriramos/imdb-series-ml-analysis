This show is not exactly the best show ever but it's certainly better than many other superhero shows. And it does try to look and feel like the Dark Knight, but is clearly restrained by it's budget.

The first episode got me hooked, but after that the next few episodes were not that great. The acting was very mediocre, especially Katie Cassidy's, but it got better towards the end of the season.

However one of the best things about this show is the action. A lot of the budget goes into the action so it looks pretty cool. Also, there are these flashbacks to when Oliver was trapped on the island, which include some of the best sequences of the show. These island sequences are the reason I watched every single episode. Also, the show has got a glossy look. 

They have also tried to bring in many of the characters from the comics. But because of this the first few episodes feel forced and we go through each villain every episode. 

Although it picks up pace after the 10th episode, and we start getting to the main storyline, after which I must say the screenwriters did a really good job.

I know 10 is high for this show, but the finale was dazzling and the next season is definitely going to be brilliant. Just hope they increase the budget though.

Overall, it's a great show scattered with a few slippery episodes,shoddy acting, but gets better as it progresses to the ending after which it seems amazing.Definitely worth checking out.
