This show is amazing! The actors are great, a lot of great scenes, a lot of people were q tiny bit disappointed by the 3rd season (i am not one of them) but clearly they are not anymore thanks to this amazing 4th season! I love the story, the crossovers, the fight scenes, keep up the good work! Every time I watch an episode i cannot wait for the next week to watch the next one. I love Arrow, Stephen Amell is one of my top idols with his acting, him being a hero on TV and in real life (F*ck Cancer) and his amazingly perfect body...I wish I can meat you one day. I also cannot wait to watch TMNT 2! Please keep Arrow going for as many seasons as you can. *SPOILER ALERT* Try to shoot scenes that only involve OTA (Original Team Arrow) more often just like you did in an episode in season 4 that i adored!

Thank you!
