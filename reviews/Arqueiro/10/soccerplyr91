I myself was a huge Smallville back in the day and I really enjoyed the episodes when Oliver Queen as the Arrow was in it. So after seeing the show end, I was really glad that they made a brand new show just for the Arrow. At first I was disappointed because the same guy who played the arrow from Smallville was not reenacting it. But, I soon became to love the acting of Stephen Amell. I think that he does a great job with his part of being Oliver Queen. I would like to see this series go on for a long time. Maybe if it gets enough viewers as long as the Smallville series which lasted about 10 seasons. That would be great! If you like movies that are adventurous with some romance in it too this is a great TV series to start watching. Also it is that type of TV show that keeps you on your toes every time you watch it.
