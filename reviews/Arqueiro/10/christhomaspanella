First off, I am a HUGE DC fan. DC characters, such as Batman, Wonder Woman, and the Green Arrow himself have always been my favorite characters, more than that so of Marvel, who I do also love. Although Batman has and will forever be my favorite vigilante or hero, Green Arrow has grown on me absolutely as a character, thanks specifically to this show. "Arrow" is a great take on a character that is often overlooked due to his "lack of physical intimidation". "Arrow" is gripping, interesting, and sticks to the character's origins and plot fully. The show leaves no loose ends of the plot untended. Each character, from my personal favorite Felicity, to the matriarchal Queen power, Moira Queen, as well as to the main character himself, Oliver Queen, is developed thoroughly, cast incredibly, and create such an intensity in only 42 minutes. The best aspect of the show ranges from being the fighting, the intelligence behind "The Hood", and the strong focus on Oliver's hardship of fitting back into Starling City as well as balancing his double life. The show puts a real world spin on a comic book character who not only shoots arrows with extreme accuracy, yet also manages to create complex relationships with his fellow supporting characters. I highly suggest this show not just to ANY and ALL comic book lovers, yet everyone in general; anyone who wants to see an action packed, wonderfully executed show should watch "Arrow".
