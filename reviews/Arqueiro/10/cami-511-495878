I like the movie, especially the idea of rich robin hood in the city, it's new and has a fresh approach. I like how action scenes are filmed and presented, the story-line and the way it is presented the hero's life : now and then (on the island). 

Nice movie, actors and plot! It;s nice that he has his father list with people that he wants to hunt and i like the connection between him, his girlfriend and the girlfriend's father (both working under law). 

I also like that he is not the person who was before going on that island but acts as he is the same guy. It's a bit strange that after 5 years on the island he knows everything about computers and software but i am sure the next episodes will present also this explanation.
