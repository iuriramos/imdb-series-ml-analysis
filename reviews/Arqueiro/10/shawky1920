good acting , good writing , good editing , make a good show Arrow one of the most wonderful and awesome series , I love the mystery, the action, Especially with the arrow/flash crossovers. I do recommend Arrow 100%! GREAT SHOW. Stephen Amell gave a great performance and he is perfect for the role of Oliver Queen/Green Arrow.

We've seen all the comic revivals from Marvel and this DC Arrow is pretty brilliant. I loved the show , cant wait for more episodes to come out , this is my favorite genre for TV shows ! Great show.love it .. I am going to keep watching this show and definitely can't wait for the new episodes!!
