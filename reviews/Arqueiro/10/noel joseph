Actually i am a great fan of batman series. what attracted me towards batman is that he became a superhero by his own hard work and talent unlike superman, green lantern etc which are just stupid. Likewise when i saw arrow, i had the same feeling as when i saw batman. Oliver Queen has some similarities as Bruce Wayne. Like Oliver on disguising as Vigilante is saving starling city and Bruce Wayne on disguising as Batman is trying to save GothomCity. This series made me understand that the most sensitive weapon which yields a glamorous look is the bow and arrow. Being fascinated in the use of arrow in 'Arrow' i started going for archery classes. And you know something its actually amazing. When holding the bow in my hand i actually feels like a vigilante and my targets as the villains. If there is a series that could inspire you on archery, it is the series 'Arrow'. I'm not gonna tell you everything in this, I assure you that you would not regret on wasting time on watching 'Arrow'.Actually the 'Arrow series are becoming more interesting after each season and more surprises on the way.......
