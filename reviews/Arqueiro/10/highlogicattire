I have to say from day one of watching this series it became an addiction! This show is so awesome and you never know what to expect next. Watch this show on your own don't take anyone's negative comments about it as an indication to not watch it because you'll be surprised how good it actually is!!! I hadn't heard of it tell after it was already into season 2 so I went back and started from episode one and I became so into the show and how well it was made that I zoomed through season one within a couple days. The cast is fit for each part that they play and they do it well you'll begin the become attached to them throughout the episodes. This is defiantly a 10 out 10! and I hope to see more a more seasons cause honestly I cant see this show ending.
