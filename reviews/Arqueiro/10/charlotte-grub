I found the first season of Arrow very entertaining and watched the first season twice - enjoying it even more the second time. The second season to me started a bit slow, I found Lora a bit annoying but I always have and I was not very keen on Sarah, but now I like her as its nice the Oliver has someone now, and the season's pace has picked up nicely. In the last two episodes I watched, I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. I really hope it continues on as it has, though I would prefer it if the Arrow would get back to killing people more, this goody-goody routine is a little to mellow for me, but this is my personal taste, and the second season as a whole is starting to turn out quiet enjoyable.
