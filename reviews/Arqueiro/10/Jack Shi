Is great screenplay I like the characters, the real hero, don't gray area "you've failed to the city" and ended with the bad guy. I think the series has everything for make a one of A kind , the characters are really good, you believe their role, the emotional charge is good thing too.

Original in compared with green arrow from the comic, I take this story and keep it that way. great background story, respond to why?.

I don't know what more cant say, I live in Mexico and I really love this TV show, i my first review ever but this TV show make me write this review.

I recommend 100% and I hope to see the 12 season of this great TV series. Every week I wait for the new episode! A long time without a good TV series!! the wait is ended
