When I first heard about the show in 2012 I honestly didn't have high hopes.

But I'm impressed. Really. Amazing show, entertaining as hell. Takes a new spin on the superhero format, beautifully written. It has its faults, some things could be improved on, some things are a bit clich√©, but all in all this show is GREAT and delivers everything that it's supposed to.

You also get hooked to the alternative storyline revealing Oliver's time on the island and everything that built up to becoming the Arrow.

In the end of the day I love it.
