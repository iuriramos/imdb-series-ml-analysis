What I love about the Arrow series is that we are following a hero with PTSD which isn't a "Super Hero" like we see in Smallville. Arrow is a human with no supernatural powers which a love about this show. Amell is also doing a great job portraying Oliver Queen as a guy with PTSD. The flash backs to the island is definitely something I give the show credit for! It gets way more interesting to see how he became the so called "Arrow" or "The Hood" if you will. 

But when you are watching Arrow have in mind that the manuscript is not meant to be realistic such as Dexter or white collar. It is more like a crazy hero kicking some bad guys asses! You should not watch the show based on the realism because it isn't logical. An example is the revenge vs. justice logic. Oliver want to see the bad guys in prison and will not kill for revenge but this isn't happening in some episodes. Another example is that Oliver don't want to hurt innocent but he kills all the bad guys bodyguards.

All in all it is a fantastic show to watch with lots of action! But if you are looking for a realistic and logical series this is not the one to watch!
