Been watching Arrow since it was first released. Didn't know what to expect as never read any of the comic books but did know the Green Arrow. 

After seeing the trailer I thought this looks good so gave it a go. All I can say it "WOW". Great character development, good acting, great fighting choreography and Stephen Amell plays Oliver McQueen really well and portrays him as a vigilante. 

I know understand more about the Arrow universe and like the fact that there are flash backs to the Island which let us as the viewer know how Oliver become who he is after returning back to Starling City after 5 years of everyone presuming he was dead 

Am hooked on Arrow now and glad that season 2 is now underway.
