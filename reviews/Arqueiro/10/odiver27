What more can I say. Love the plot. Love the acting. Love the guys. Oops, Ill keep that to myself. Glad to see Colton Haynes from Teen Wolf is on the show. Looking forward to more of this talented actor. Stephen is amazing, love his personality.

Disappointed the season is over, but am very pleased and can't wait for season two. I just hope it doesn't get canceled. Glad it is on CW it definitely has a fighting chance, their program mangers are a lot brighter than ABC that gives up on everything in it's first season because 25 million viewers is not their acceptable billion for determining how popular a show is. Oops, did I digress?

This hand in hand with Beauty and the Beast are a nice addition to CW's already awesome programming schedule. 

A definite winner in my book.
