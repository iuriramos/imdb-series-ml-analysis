Always being a big fan of Smallville, Arrow had been on my list for quite some time. Thankfully, Netflix added the first season and I was able to consume it in a little under a week, something I haven't done since I watched Dexter for the first time. The last episodes of the first season and all of the 2nd season have been some of the best television this past year, second only to Breaking Bad, IMO. Any prior fans of Smallville will love Arrow. It's made by the same team and the production value has increased dramatically since then. I couldn't help to compare it to Lost or Batman Begins in some regard, which are great shows to emulate. Also a lot of great cameos from actors known for their roles in other sci-fi shows, a feature of Smallville I enjoyed thoroughly.
