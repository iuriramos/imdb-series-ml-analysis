I watched Smallville which was really good and now I watched the pilot for The Flash last night and I must admit that DC really does their TV shows awesome. When Arrow started of it kept me thinking about the next episode enough to make myself some food and be comfortable and not disturbed by anything when I watch an episode and now I can't wait for season 3, starting tomorrow. Acting is very nice now, seems like all the people on the set started to love their character (especially Emily Bett Rickards, I mean she was awesome at acting Felicity from day one. I like the tech and effects, soundtrack really sounds good at all times (feels epic, tempting, crime-like and super-hero like too) and the script is just awesome comparing to the comics, but still keeping it on a believable, fairly realistic level. This might one of the best sci-fi shows out there in my opinion right next to Supernatural and others.

*I noticed that DC likes to do things a little bit more seriously and mature than Marvel does which puts people that are a little older than nerd fan-boys in a position to find these shows that DC does quite a bit interesting. Don't get me wrong, I love superheroes from both companies but when it comes to television and film DC's a tiny bit better and I see a very bright future for them.
