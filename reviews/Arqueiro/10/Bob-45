In a world where government officials routinely authorize torture and mass murder and white collar criminals destroy lies for greed, why should I give a whit that the latest "superhero" is not some "save the bad guys for justice" Boy Scout? Arrow would not be able to take down as many opponents if he had to deal with such niceties as "shooting guns out of the hands". I was rather pleasantly taken aback when he broke the back of one of the more vicious assailants, as "instant karma" is especially welcome in a world where justice rather seems to exist.

While "Daredevil" is still my favorite "superhero" (no great wealth, no particularly fancy toys and is handicapped to boot), I hope "Arrow" is amazingly successful as it is a terrific show; and, who knows, maybe its success will encourage some enterprising producer to create a "Daredevil" TV series.

By the way, having Oliver Queen's little sister nicknamed "Speedy" may foreshadow her fate, as I notice she is cast in only the first three episodes so far.
