i love this show so much season 3 was my personal favorite because of the story lines but all 4 are amazing. If you are looking for a good action, adventive, drama, sci-fi show then 'Arrow' is the show for you,also if you like 'Arrow' then you should watch 'The Flash' because they cross over and have good story lines. In the show there is an amazing romance between 'Oliver' and 'Felicity' there ship name is 'Olicity' i think they are an amazing couple and have shipped them since the beginning of the shoe when Felicity was first introduced. 'Roy' and 'Thea' also have an amazing relation ship and both join Oliver's team to help fight 'Slade Wilson' and 'Deathstokes' 'Mirakuru' soldiers.
