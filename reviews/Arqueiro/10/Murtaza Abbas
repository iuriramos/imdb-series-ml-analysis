If you are looking to seeing a terrific superhero TV serial every week, then arrow is a MUST-see for you. One might argue that this idea has been taken from robin hood/batman but the direction and acting makes it a unique experience! I would put this series right in the ranks of TV series likes of Game of thrones, Walking Dead & Dexter etc. The script writer has skill fully kept many things hidden and open and releasing them slowly and makes the audience hungry for more. Bottomline is, see a couple of episodes. If you have ever liked any super hero movie/comic/cartoon in the past, chances are you will cling to this series very strongly.
