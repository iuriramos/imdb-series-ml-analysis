This show does an amazing job of taking what you think is going to happen then completely flipping on a dime and saying "how you like that". I think the cast fits perfect and the story lines keep getting deeper and deeper. As a person who wasn't a big episodic show person, Arrow is the reason that I run the risk of a speeding ticket every Wednesday after work.

I personally was a pretty big smallville fan and have always been a sucker for comic book based shows/movies. When I heard about arrow I was really really worried they were just gonna put the smallville green arrow in there from where smallville left off thank god they didn't. This show is dark it's action packed and it has very very beautiful women. I love this show and don't intend to change my mind about it.
