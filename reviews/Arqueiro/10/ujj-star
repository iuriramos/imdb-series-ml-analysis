Right from the pilot episode, the series has captivated me well enough to prevent me from missing any of its episodes. Its got a great storyline, a lot of action stunts, superheroes, family drama, love trysts and its enigmatic tales. Its a story of a playboy, Oliver Queen, who was presumed dead, returns after five years from a deserted island to avenge his father's death and save his city from its tainted citizens. The flashbacks that display Oliver's period in the island are enthralling and the challenges that he had to face in order to survive there, shaped him to be the present day vigilante who is not afraid to face any authority. Its one of my current favorite TV shows and you've got to get yourself hooked on to it....:)
