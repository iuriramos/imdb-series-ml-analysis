If you take the time to notice, all of the bad user ratings are from users that only watched the first 3 episodes. The story has to be set up and of course the first 3 episodes of every show is a little rocky. Once the show gets in the mode of things and the plot develops, the show burns into an intense crazy fire of a plot that will be the only thing on your mind for weeks. It's a fantastic show with fantastic writing and a very talented and carefully chosen cast. Give it a chance. Though the story is very much not the same as the comic series green arrow, I would never imagine it any other way. This portrayal is very dense and contains many possibilities to branch out. Personally I think it is the best thing to happen to DC since Batman.
