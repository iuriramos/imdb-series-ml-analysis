its just amazing. i love the action scenes. but they said its Action | Adventure | Crime but they forgot to add drama there's like 10 minutes of that. but still an awesome show you have to watch it.. but the comic is a bit different. i mean if you read this which is an analysis of his life, ( http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Arrow_(Oliver_Queen)) its kinda different... and it would be cooler if they get one or two characters of the justice league to help. batman would be awesome with him. batman's life and arrows are kinda similar, i mean there both billionaire vigilantes. like imagine if arrow was kidnapped in Gotham City and batman comes and helps him, and then tells him to join the justice league :D.
