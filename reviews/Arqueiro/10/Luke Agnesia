I absolutely love everything about this show. This show has inspired me to be an actor and how Stephen Amell portrays oliver queen, I think is one of the most outstanding performances off all acting. My dream is to one day be apart of the DC universe.I really can not say enough how much bringing Diggle into the arrow as the leader/voice of reason is truly amazing. The storyline for all seasons so far has been fantastic (if you really concentrate and focus on them and the flash backs). The way this one show has also made two more shows because of there success explains why you need to watch it. The flash and legends of tomorrow have been absolutely fundamental as well. I can not wait too see if they are planning on bringing Batman, Night wing, Aqua man, and whoever else.
