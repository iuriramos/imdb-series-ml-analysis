Stephen Amell is a wonderful actor for Green Arrow! I love the DC references, (Spoiler Alert) and now that Sarah is Black Canary and Slade having super-human powers, and maybe Roy too. Overall the show is great. Thea's character is good too, I like her development throughout the show, as well as Moira and Malcolm. The only flaw in the show is Tommy's death, I feel like it should have been written a tad bit better, and I also think it should have affected Laurel more. I really like what they are doing with Barry also, the actor for him is great, and I LOVED the scene where he became the Flash and how they foreshadowed it throughout season 2. I can't wait for Brother Blood and Ra's Al Ghul to join the show more and I loved the Soloman Grundy reference with Diggle.
