Fantastic show. I always look for solid character development in every movie or TV show regardless of genre and this show definitely brings it. The action scenes are great, don't get me wrong and I am sure that a majority of the audience is in it for those scenes. And the story line is likewise fantastic. However, what really hooks me is the constant traits of friendship and sacrifice that is prevalent in the show. Each member of the team would offer themselves as a sacrifice for one another time and time again. Even in Season 3 when all hope seems lost, Oliver is still trying to save his friends lives in exchange for his own life. Over all, I love the show.
