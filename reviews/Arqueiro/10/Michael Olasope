Tbh,this is just awesome. It has what 'smallville' lacked. though smallville was entertaining,it was slightly not as mature as i would want it to be. From the first episode where the green arrow killed his kidnapper,i knew this would be different. and it has not disappointed me yet. The story line,is awesome too.I love the characters,even thought the green arrow can be quite annoying sometimes. but if he was perfect,there wouldn't be much of a show would there. All in all,you should start watching this if you are a superhero flick fan and even if you are not. believe me,it will be worth it. From the creators of 'game of thrones' and 'smallville' this is a must watch.
