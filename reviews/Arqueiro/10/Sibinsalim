Have to say this Arrow Series is really pretty good i started to watch it by accident trust me its pretty interesting and makes me very curious to watch the next 

Now talking about this series a very unique one from the rest of the series i have watched the acting of Stephen Amell is pretty good and i really look forward to watch him in the big films soon and its the best superhero series i have seen so far i really hope they make an another seasons and also they could increase the length of the each series to 52min rather than to 24min then it would be good to watch but overall i give it an 10/10 stars
