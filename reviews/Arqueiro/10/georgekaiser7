We are now past the halfway point of Season 2 and I can say for sure that "Arrow" is the best superhero series ever and one of the best series in television. 

Arrow is a realistic take on the hooded vigilante Green Arrow (seemingly influenced by Nolan's "The Dark Knight" Trilogy) and it proves to be exactly what we needed. The story of the show is exiting, suspenseful and manages to keep the adrenaline high on every second of an episode. The episodes themselves, connect very well to one another and we can see their relevance in the main continuity more and more as we approach the Season 2 "Finale". The characters are interesting and all are well- developed. Each and everyone of them have their place in the show and we can see everyone in a shining moment. Also, Arrow does a great work with it's villains always managing to offer the hero and his team quite the challenge. 

The show's characters might differ in some ways from the comics in order to fit into this more realistic world, but this is done in a way that doesn't irritate comic book fans and keeps the average viewer interested. But for the hardcore fans, many famous comic book characters are introduced.

Finally, Arrow's effects work really well. Choosing to use practical effects over CGI was a very good decision helping both the realistic look and the visual appeal of the show. The costumes look good and also match the tone. The soundtrack fits the episodes perfectly and, while it isn't a masterpiece, is still pretty nice.

For me personally "Arrow is the best series on television, along with "Game of Thrones" and thats why it gets a straight 10/10 (Masterpiece) rating.
