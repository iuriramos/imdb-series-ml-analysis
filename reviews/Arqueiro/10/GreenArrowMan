I really enjoy watching the show since the first episode of the first season came out on The CW. Love every single episode and it was enjoyable to watch them because in every single episode that I have watch, it gets interesting as to when each of the main characters we learn new things about their past and what they did during that time. Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen/The Arrow/Green Arrow is good because it is always good to have someone who can show us that they are good at playing those roles and the same thing to the other actors because they are just good at playing the characters that they are still playing as of today. As of Season 4, things are quite interesting because of Green Arrow was finally there and it made me feel happy just to have Oliver suiting up as The Green Arrow. I cant wait to see all of the future episodes and up until the series finale.
