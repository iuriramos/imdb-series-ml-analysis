Wow, I just discovered this show on Netflix. I am a mother of 2 teenage boys, we all enjoy the show. There is a balance between action and drama and the foreshadowing is subtle. The actors are so sincere and believable, you forget it is a TV show. The story is great and each show leaves you anxious for the next. I can't stop thinking about it during my day. Of course, I also love the scenes between Oliver and Laurel. I watched the seen where Oliver tells Laurel that he is ready to leave the island 3 times. It was so sincere, and you could feel his heartache, and the music choice was perfect. Then I had to watch the scene where Oliver and Laurel finally get together, Ep 22, a couple more times. I had waited all season for that! It took my breath away and brought tears to my eyes. Yes, the scene was that good. Now I have to watch season 2. You guys are doing an awesome job with this show. I can't wait for more!
