This show is so very unpredictable that even me (who is good at guessing what is going to happen next) can't see what's coming. This show is amazing and has too me on a long ride of superhero drama. Every episode ending is basically a cliff hanger that leaves you questioning either, every thing about the story or everything about the characters. The acting is amazing. Stephen Amel as our Emerald Archer is one of the best casting choices I've seen on T.V. The rest of the cast also work so well with each other and Katie Cassidy is brilliant as well. I praise this show so much because I think it is well done in every area. The action is brilliant and suspense filled which is good because it goes so well with the theme of the show. 

Arrow is such a young show and is going to grow and become even better (if that's possible) and I personally can't wait to see Summer Glau in the next season because season two is going to be spectacular.
