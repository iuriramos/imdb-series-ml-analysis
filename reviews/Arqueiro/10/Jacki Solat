Superhero movies are incredibly tough to make: balancing the plot, trying to make the storyline believable, all while adding well done fight scenes. This film does it beautifully. One of the very few to do it too. I can't say that other than The Dark Knight trilogy, I can't think of one superhero movie/TV program that does "superheroes" well. 

I thought this show was exciting and completely understood how to make a superhero real. Every part of every character was enough to make me shed a tear at the first season finale. Completely worth watching and will have you begging to watch just one more.

I find it hard to get too into shows that don't tell you everything at first because the show tends to draw secrets out way too long. There wasn't much of that here. I felt almost satisfied with every episode. However there were some cliffhangers to leave me on the edge of my seat.

If you are a fan of superheroes AT ALL, watch this series. I guarantee it will not disappoint.
