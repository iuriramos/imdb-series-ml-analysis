Great show! Arrow is a great mix of multiple genres, it is action packed and exciting, yet emotional and can be a little romantic. The casting in this show is so perfect, Stephen Amell is the perfect actor for Oliver as he is a park our expert and does all his own stunts making this show realistic. This show has a great soundtrack as well as a great catch line. You will find yourself quoting this show. There are those people that will say they don't like this show and I really don't understand them and wouldn't listen to them. This show is exciting for anyone, almost addicting! Overall this show is exciting and suspenseful, and a great show to watch anytime!
