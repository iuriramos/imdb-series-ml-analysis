Amazing show, every week it gets better, never lets me down. Storyline is full of twists and turns but without getting overly complicated, sure to keep you interested,and the acting is very good. I especially like Amell, he did a great job acting as oliver, especially his stone coldness upon arrival home and also the progressive change in his personality in becoming a better man. Worth checking out at the very least if you are interesting, hand to hand combat is very well choreographed and played out. Good special effects and stunts. The only bad thing about it now, is that there is no way they can possibly make it even better next season. Or can they...
