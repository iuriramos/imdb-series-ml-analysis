Since the pilot, Arrow's been a good show, and very popular. Having seen every episode, I thought the first two seasons were strong, though the Mirakuru element made me nervous. Now that we're approaching the third season's finale, I'm nervous again, but that's because the producers have said they're changing the elements of the show to more or less be in line with The Flash.

A side note: if Arrow is the brooding older brother, The Flash is its energetic, lighthearted younger brother, with lots of go (pun intended).

Back to Arrow. Can't say I like the Felicity/Ray pairing very much, especially when Ray is maligning Oliver. He has no idea what Oliver went through! However, I'm sure the writers will steer Felcity back towards Oliver eventually (fingers crossed!)
