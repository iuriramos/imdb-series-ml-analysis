We are very crucial and critical when it comes to story lines. We love watching Arrow and other superhero flicks already, but what really caught our attention is the writing of Season 2. Amazing twist and turns as well as the lines.. not cheesy and no clich√©s at all! Great acting, great fight scene and of course, a touch of Chris Nolan's Dark Knight is what we noticed. We were so glued that we watched half the season in about 24 hours LOL! 

Great work and we are looking forward to season 3 and more!

EXCELLENT WORK!!!!
