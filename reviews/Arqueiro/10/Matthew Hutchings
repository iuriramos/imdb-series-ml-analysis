I thoroughly enjoyed the pilot episode, and not being a comic book fan didn't feel lost at all. The story is set up extremely well, and you can see there is clearly a lot of potential there and a lot of places they can explore if they so desire. Along with "last resort" this was the best new pilot that i have seen in a while. I can see this running a long time, as it strongly reminds me of Nolan's Batman series and is completely different to the green arrow offered up in "Smallville" which i also thought was pretty good in its own unique way. The darker grittier Green Arrow is a much better one and i prefer the way he isn't being portrayed as someone who is extremely nice to everyone and only uses violence when its the only way out like a "batman" sort of character. You can also see how what happened at the start has affected him and the difference is portrayed well by the other cast members; all of whom seem to be suited to their respective roles.

It is too early to say whether this is gonna be around for ages and be known as the best comic book to TV show adaptation, however if the show can continue its quality that was shown in the pilot episode then the future is green for Arrow!
