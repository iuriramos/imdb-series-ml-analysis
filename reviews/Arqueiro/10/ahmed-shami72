I had no interest in watching the show when i first heard about it. But many of my friends were highly recommending it, since I've been a DC fan since childhood so i thought id give it a try.I got hooked to it as soon as i finished the first episode and i watched 9 more episodes after that. The best thing about the show is that it doesn't only show oliver's present days but also the 5 years he spent on the island. we get to see what changed the billionaire playboy brat into a crime fighting vigilante. The story keeps you wanting for more no matter what. The fighting scenes keep getting better and better in every episode, the only way it can be described as is EPIC. It kills me to wait a whole week before i watch another episode of such an excellently written, directed, and acted show
