While I've never read the comic book series, this show still thoroughly entertains me. At the end of every episode I was left truly longing for the next episode as soon as possible. I found the plot line of this show had a near perfect amount of complexity,and having the flashbacks to the island I found really supported the story and made me even more interested. This show does a great job of intertwining story and timelines, and that's what really drew me in. As for the characters, I found they were all were all portrayed very well. The occasional comic relief particularly from Diggle and Felicity were particularly appreciated. Overall I really enjoyed this show, and can't wait to see what the writers have in store
