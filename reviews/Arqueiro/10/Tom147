I originally had no interest in watching Arrow but I was persuaded about a month ago as everyone kept telling me how great it was. I gave it a chance and became hooked, I've watched series 1 & 2 in just over a month and I will certainly be up to date by the time Arrow returns in January 2015. I am loving it, every episode is just fun to watch and there's so many likable characters. 

The actions scenes are exceptional and I love the storytelling of the series where we get present day and also revelations from the past. I think this brings the story together exceptionally well. There are plenty of sub plots so the show always feels fresh. It is the right amount of action, drama and also some subtle comedy (mainly from Felicity). 

There's a lot of likable characters such as Oliver, Felicity, Diggle, Thea, Roy and many more. I really hope Arrow can keep to its high standards because its a thoroughly entertaining show and I want more! 

10/10
