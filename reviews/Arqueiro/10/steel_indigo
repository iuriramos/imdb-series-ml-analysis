I'm an older person so watching movies or TV series originating from comic books isn't high on my list, but recently many that have been made for theaters and TV screens have been wonderful. At the top of a list is "Arrow." I fell in love with this show from the beginning and I think a lot of it has to do with the choices in casting. All of the cast has done a superb job with their characters. I don't know why anyone would accuse the actors who portray Oliver and Laurel to be wooden. This story has changed over time. I took the time to look up the back history of the Green Arrow and all of its incarnations. They took all of that and made it better as a TV series. I absolutely love Amell in the part of Arrow. He does a great job and I can find no fault in his acting whatsoever. He portrays his character at different time periods and personas and does a wonderful job. I have seen hundreds of movies and TV series in my life time and I have to say this one is awesome. It's great for females and males. It has dynamic female characters and male. It isn't like any other show I have watched and I have seen many and it isn't copying anyone else because the story of the Arrow is actually quite old. If you like high energy action with a little romance thrown in but not overdone then this is the show for you and especially if you are a comic book fan. The special affects are very good for TV. I plan on watching it every week and hope it stays on the air for many more seasons. I didn't give a synopsis since there are many here already.
