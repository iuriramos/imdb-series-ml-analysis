I was not a comic book nerd but this show made me one....well strictly speaking a nerd about green arrow *_* I started watching it 11 months ago in January 2014 when they were on a break after winter finale of 2nd season. The show captivated me from the 1st episode and i binged watch it through season 1 and 1st half of season 2 in just 3 days. It has a superhero with no superpowers....I'm not a fan of super powers.....So obviously i fell in love with it instantaneously. And cast is good too. Now a week long wait for a new episode seems like a year so obviously hiatus feels like centuries. My only complain is the number of filler episodes that are obviously necessary because a show can't retain quality throughout 23 episodes a season. Overall a good fun show that keeps me captivated throughout the hour.
