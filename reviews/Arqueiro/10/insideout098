Every episode is tight, the characters compelling, likable, focused, and at times, riveting. The plot structures are reminiscent of "24" and that's saying a lot. Every episode is better than the one before. There is chemistry amongst the core cast which is tough to find, and even tougher to hold together. I only hope that the writers stay in this for the long haul because there will be a long haul given the quality of every aspect of this show.

On a final note, Felicity is incredible. Her character is well drawn and her execution flawless. Of course, I could say the same for Diggs and Oliver. What a team.

Okay, I'll add one more final note: I was never a fan of the righteous "save my city" line, but I got over it.
