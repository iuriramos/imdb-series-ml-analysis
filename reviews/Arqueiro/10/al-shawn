we like Arrow and we like everything about the show.. BUT! Katie/ Loral was very attractive the first season but now she has lost so much weight we cant stand looking at her, skin and bones.. not attractive anymore, hard too watch. Sorry, Eat some food girl way too skinny. As the show goes its one of our favorite shows on TV, thanks for such great entertainment. we need more and more super hero shows, miss smallville ha ha ha but Arrow has filled the void for now, keep up the good work and have a burger Katie. agents of shield is a great show also, hope Arrow stays around for a long time, and we hope Superman shows up in a episode soon, Cant wait for more and more episodes of Arrow to come. Thanks AL Garcia
