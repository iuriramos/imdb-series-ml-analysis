Started watching Arrow and all things are going well - I love the cast, the build up and the mystery. Stephen Amell is pretty great as Oliver Queen - he has the right kinda look, act and movement - and his acting skills are developing a lot more along the way. 

Started off great too - the Pilot was phenomenal and I loved every moment of it because it had a great start and a great finish. I like the support cast too, they're good actors and they're the right choice for the characters that they're playing. I haven't seen any of Season 2 yet, but I will get round to that eventually. Right now, I'm enjoying Season 1 and I can't wait to see what happens next - I'm sure there's going to be a few surprises here and there. For what I have seen, so far, so good. 

Also, the dialogue is pretty great too, and I like how it gives good balance between each scene - one scene is full of dialogue, the next is a fight sequence between Oliver and some guys, and so on. Honestly, I don't think anyone could've pulled it off; Genuinely, Stephen Amell is top-notch as Oliver and I would say Amell is becoming one of my favourite actors, slowly but surely.

Well overall, this was another extremely positive review on a wonderful, fresh and dramatic TV show - Arrow. I rate the show a strong 9.0 or 9.5/10 thus far and it could round up to a strong and solid 10 the more I see of it. Very good show. Thanks for checking out my review, guys.
