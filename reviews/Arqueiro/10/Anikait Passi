its not just reference to laurel's death . they keep killing every1 like its some GTA going on . and killing a black canary ?? are u kidding me ?? just because killing a villain is straightforward doesn't mean u can the most important member of cast. THIS SHOW DIED WHEN RA'S AL GHUL KILLED OLIVER QUEEN" ever since , they are just stretching it like anything. island story is f***ed up by baron rieter. i mean it was soo cool when DEATHSTROKE was there. soooo original !!! and now everything tossed to garbage . IF U CANT RUN THE SHOW THEN Don't ! a main superhero u killed , that too by some F***er whose powers are like a 9 yr old fantasy boy. not to mention his comic alias is also nearly = 0 . i see why people like this show ..... "MADE BY IDIOTS FOR IDIOTS "ï»¿
