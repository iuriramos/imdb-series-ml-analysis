Although the show starts off really good and i hope it gets better onwards, the plot is the similar to other superhero movies, it is suspenseful and it establishes a great start to an awesome Superhero show.

This show is mostly going to be flashbacks because of the shipwreck where Oliver's girlfriends sister, who he is sleeping with dies along with his father which changes Oliver, just like in any other superhero movie where the superhero has something that changes them and makes them a better person.

Even though the story is very good, the choice of the city on which the series is based on doesn't seem that great. I mean like Gotham is a legendary city but starling city doesn't seem like something that will go famous. They should have picked a city in real life to make it more interesting.

Overall, a superb Pilot.
