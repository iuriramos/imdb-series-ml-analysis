I have seen so many excellent TV shows canceled like Commander in Chief, Proof, The Firm, Drop Dead Diva, etc. and it's quite a huge disappointment. Thank God this hasn't happened to Arrow. Arrow started with a very exciting plot. Lots of action and good drama. I love the TV series, but the last couple of episodes where Felicity breaks up with Oliver makes me change my mind. Oliver deserves to be in love and be happy. All super heroes need love in their lives to balance it. I hope the writers change the story and make these two to be together. It was a great part of the series, if not the best one. Most of my Facebook friends agree with my opinion. Please make it happen!
