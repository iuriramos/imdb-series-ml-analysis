This show started off great from season 1, onto season 2, then it began to slow down a bit in season 3 and 4, but it picks up again with action in season 5. There are many story line build ups, and great flashbacks, and it also compliments with the action and fight scenes. One major critic of the show will be how the writers will often attempt to put in too many love sequences in a super hero show, another will be how the story doesn't follow up as well with the Green Arrow comics. If the show sticks to its action first and love story later, it will stay more consistent to what fans would love to see, and this will keep the show alive for a longer number of seasons. The best part of this show is that it provides its viewers with crossover episodes, and team ups with other super hero shows such as the Flash. These crossover episodes provides more action and delivers a comic book genre type of team up for fans or even non comic book fans to enjoy. On a side note, season 2 of this show is by far the best TV show season I have ever watched. Even if you do not have time watching this show, just watch season 2, you won't regret it.
