I just saw the first episode of Arrow. and frankly i was amazed. this Series fell right into my taste and i can't wait to see more.

This world is apparently based on an old super hero (arrow - green arrow) i cannot say i have read it buy i will most certainly consider it after seeing this pilot!

Where it separates, and distinguishes, itself from other Superhero series/movies is it is MUCH grittier and dark. Where as other superhero focuses on "merely" disarming the bad guys without hurting them overly much Arrow has no problem with killing or maiming them.

Another difference is Arrow seems to be mainly after the white collared criminals of his city rather than some "super villain" bent on world domination.

The acting, fight scenes and filming is superb! the music fits perfectly with the show. dark and gritty.

I immensely enjoyed the first episode and i can't wait for more! - 10/10
