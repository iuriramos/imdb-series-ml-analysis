This TV show is a amazing story. I love everything about it nothing has ever disappointed me at all. Oliver queen is the best vigilante's ever. Green arrow has never been seen this popular until arrow so it's a big + to there popularity. I think the romance is amazing. Also how they bring so much of the DC characters back in a new form. If your thinking of watching this please do. It inspired me to start making movies and TV shows. you will love the story to this you will love the characters you will love everything about it. Nothing is ever disappointing about this you are going to enjoy this a lot. Oliver queen is a 10 out of 10 on his abs. Oh one more thing He has a bow and arrow so cool.
