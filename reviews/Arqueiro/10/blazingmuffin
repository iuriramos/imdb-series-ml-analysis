I am a comic book fan and this is definitely not supposed a "comic booky" show if you will. Firstly, the character of green arrow is not even called green arrow, so this tells you it is only loosely based off green arrow. Oliver Queen is more serious but he is still a well done character. The Arrow is unsurprisingly a more serious vigilante. He definitely becomes more of a hero rather than a vigilante which is a good change. The origin is a bit different but still very well done. The flashbacks get better as the show goes on. The plot escalates well. Most of the characters develop well especially Tommy, and detective Lance. I just don't like Laurel but the rest of the show makes up for it. Any who insult this show, likely haven't watched through even season 1, so they have no reason to complain. It was good from the beginning but improves as the show goes on. In closing, watch and see for yourself.
