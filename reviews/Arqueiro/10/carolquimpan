WOW, every episode will literally blow you. it's amazing. Stephen Amell is perfect for the arrow. if this will have a movie, Amell should be the arrow. I think it's also best if it will have a crossover with Supergirl or Legends of Tomorrow. It might be fun. Every season, they have something new to offer, and that newness will not bore you, it will make you more get hooked to the upcoming episodes. I hope this will last long for a lot of seasons. It's definitely worth it. And for the fact that they deviate from the comic, that instead of Canary, the love affair of the Arrow is Felicity which i think was also one of the reasons that many are hooked to this Amazing TV Series!
