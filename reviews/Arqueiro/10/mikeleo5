I remember first hearing about this show when I saw it on the cover of entertainment weekly about two years ago. It didn't look like anything special so I didn't even care to read the article. Now, I own a netflix account and after going through series after series, I ran out of things to watch. So, I saw Arrow and I thought, "Well it has good reviews and I've heard good things from critics and my friends so, why not?" BEST DECISION I EVER MADE. 

This show is down right fantastic. I consider myself a critic when it comes to entertainment, and so does everyone I know. I do this so much, that some people find me annoying. So trust me when I tell you, this show is great. The acting can be iffy at times, but what it lacks there it makes up for in the action, love story, non stop suspense, and the amazing plot. I was not a fan of the Green Arrow comics, but I can tell you I am now. And I have to say this interpretation on this show is one of the single most greatest things I've ever had the chance to watch (besides for Breaking Bad, of course). I'm on serious withdrawal from this show seeing as I just finished season one minutes ago on netflix and the first episodes from the second season (which I've heard is better than the first) are not on on demand. I am a huge fan of the comics of DC and video games, but I never really liked Green Arrow or even thought he was cool. After this, I can assure you I was so wrong. This show is a must see and if you think the beginning of the show is slow, I promise it gets better as it goes on. And apparently, the second season has developed into a actual good emmy award nominated show. Just look at the ratings compared from season one too now. I need more episodes so get on it Netflix because myself and many other fans cannot wait much longer.
