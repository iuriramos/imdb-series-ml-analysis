When you sit back and realize that this is a super hero show on TV. Everything is done really well. Give it a chance to improve over multiple seasons (if the ratings are good enough). The pilot alone is better then any smallville episode thats out there. Interested in more about how he learned the languages and martial arts on the island. He was not on that island alone I don't know why some people have said that. Maybe they thought the show was inferring that some how. But never the less it was a great pilot that had a good twist at the end. It showed real promise. If anything now that the batman movies are over this show can hold you over until MAN OF STEEL next summer. If your a fan of batman or comics in general you owe it to yourself to try this show out. He may seem to similar to batman but I assure you give it time and you will see many differences. The main one is that green arrow kills unlike batman. Which is just one example of the differences they share. Another notable one is bruce wayne chose to be batman and train in Asian for years. Green arrow was made that way out of more survival of a life or death situation.
