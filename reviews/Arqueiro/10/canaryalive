It is very good series drama, with an interesting character development. One very spoiled boy, who thinks only about women and booze, endures 5 years in torture and life in a war situations, to turn him into humane, strong and compassionate human being, who wants to sacrifice his own life for the happiness and well being of others. It is also made kind of realistic, because good doesn't always win and the main characters often make mistakes, and are weak and human. Just to mention that no matter the series rotates around one man's battle to fight the evil, it has strong female characters, who have their own story arch and are brainy and beautiful and fight really well.
