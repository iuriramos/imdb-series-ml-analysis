OK this series is a whole lot better than any TV shows I've seen. This a thrilling TV show and very catchy. Just get through half of season one and you will love it. I love the how they leave you thinking of how people knew Oliver before he came back from the "dead". I'm currently watching it on Netflix and can't wait till season 4 gets out on Netflix. Love this show cause it is somewhat realistic. It can come true. You just need to be a really good archer and need to be good at everything that Oliver queen is on this show. I hope the Arrow series will continue on for 6 seasons. I guarantee if you like watching action shows you will love this show.
