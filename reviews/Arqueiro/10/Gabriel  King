Initially, I had no expectations on the show whatsoever. After viewing the first episode I thought the show was satisfying, good action, good story, but unrealistic, and too much like Batman. By watching more and more episodes, it becomes clear why that is that oliver queen is that strong.

*Do not base your rating on the first episode or the second, KEEP WATCHING* The show is absolutely great, amazing characters, loads of action, and awesome flashbacks on Oliver's years spent on the island (which are my favorite parts to be honest).

Exceptional work from the cast of arrow, hope there will be lots of seasons!
