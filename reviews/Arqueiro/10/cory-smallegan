The pure amount of progression with this show is incredible. Some shows have the first season be their best, not Arrow. Season 2 has been an INCREDIBLE ride with so many twists and turns while also pumping out great dialog and acting. How they have taken a character that I just tolerated from Smallville and completely dominated his presence in Arrow is a breath of fresh air. The flashbacks integrated within the main storyline is done so naturally that you don't care if half the episode is taking place in the past or not. Oliver Queen is a name you will not soon forget. If you are not watching this show, then you are SERIOUSLY missing out!
