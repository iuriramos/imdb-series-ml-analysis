So disappointed and I used to love this show. My husband and I would anxiously await the new episode each week. Now, he is on his phone and I am on my kindle. The sexual tension between Oliver and Felicity was great. The series was at it's best when it was just Oliver, Diggle and Felicity on the team. Ever since the first time the Arrow joined with the Flash, the series has taken a nosedive. The writing has become eye rolling dumb and the lines just plain cheesy. The Arrow wears a costume to hide his identity, yet everyone and their brother now know his secret. Plus, all of his remaining friends and family think they are crime fighters now too. The acting is well done given the script that the actors have to work with. Please go back to the old formula and make this show great again.
