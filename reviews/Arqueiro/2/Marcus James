Easily the most boring superhero series ever created. Then again, its not like the Green Arrow comics are masterpieces. But this show takes it to a new level of boredom. 99% of the show is drama between really dumb people who act like high schoolers. It basically Buffy with almost 90% less action with everyone acting like they are 15 years old while being in their 30s. Even enemies are completely stupid and plots boil down to dumb and dumber.

Cheap soap operas are at least funny due to how ridiculous the stories and acting are. This one is not funny, it is not smart, it has no suspense, and there are no redeeming characters anywhere.
