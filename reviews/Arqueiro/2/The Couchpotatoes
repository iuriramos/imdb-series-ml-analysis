This show gets an eight star rating? Really? Did I miss something or am I living on a different planet or what? Seriously I wonder who is voting for this piece of garbage. I watched the whole first season and I will never forgive myself for that. I thought I gave it a shot, that it might get better, but no it only got worse. The script is so badly written and the actors are below average it's painful to watch. I wonder what Katie Cassidy had to do to get this role? It was for sure not for her acting skills she got the job. And don't get me wrong, I normally do like some superhero action, but this one is too ridiculous for words. Avoid this show at all costs!
