When I started to watch the show I really didn't like the regular "story from the past" insertions. But sadly, after more and more episodes, those became actually far more interesting that the main story. Then I stopped watching. it really felt that I can just watch any episode in any order and I wouldn't even know if I had seen it or not. It was all so cookie cutter. The main character is not bad, but then it goes pretty down from there. Now I realize that the entire series was written by a bunch of 12 y o during their summer break. There can be no other explanation for the mind bogglingly inane "plot" that tries to carry this series through. Pap is too good a word for this garbage !
