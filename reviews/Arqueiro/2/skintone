I actually enjoyed the first season of this show. I can suspend disbelief for any fantasy that is reasonable( zombies in Walking Dead that can be killed just with a spike to the brain? No problem). I even could overlook the unlikely fact that Oliver becomes a world champion ninja warrior on the island. But then came the real insult to our intelligence. We are expected to believe that his skinny kid sister (Thea) and even skinnier ex girlfriend (Laurel) can become amazing ninja superheroes with just a few months of training sessions. Suddenly they can beat most beafy badass men in a fight??? WTF???? Why is no one talking about this???

Fail That's when you lost me. Sorry
