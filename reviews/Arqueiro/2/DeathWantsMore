I somehow endured 3 seasons of this, just because I had nothing to watch. It's not even THAT bad if you think about main story line, just a relaxing show, everything is pretty mediocre, but the main problem here is... Fillers. 23 episodes each season, about 7-8 of them are actually tied to the main story line, rest of the episodes they're dealing with maniacs, serial killers, robbers, drug dealers etc. It's totally pointless, cause you always know who will win and you always know that no one from the "good guys" will be seriously hurt/die in the process. Later it gets even worse - they're re-using same filler characters, they magically resurrecting, escaping from prison and other bs, but at least you're aware right at the start of an episode that it's going to be a lousy filler yet again.

Really don't understand why they need to make 23 episodes each season when most of them filled with stuff like I described above. It's really painful to watch and kills any amount of hype so that you don't even care about main story anymore.
