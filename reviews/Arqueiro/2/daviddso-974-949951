At first , i liked the show , i watched maybe 5-6 first episodes in a row because i really liked the idea of a superhero i don't know much about in a real life show.

But the more i keep watching and the more the show feel like they are going short of superhero idea so they fill the show with family drama .

So today i got episode 10 .. after 3-4 min i started skipping ahead because i was already really bored and all i could see coming is more drama , i was really disappointed by episode 9 , there was so much useless bad drama that i can only ask myself how a cameraman can film this without feeling the need to blow his brain out , i guess they hired some old lady's addicted to crying to bad soap show to film , direct and write the script .

IMO this show is a mix between batman and dynasty , oliver queen should sign up for a name change to drama queen .
