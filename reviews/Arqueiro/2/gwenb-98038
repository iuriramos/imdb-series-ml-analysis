Used to love Arrow and my husband and I have been loyal fans but what have they done to this show. SUPERHEROES GALORE. LAZARUS PITS. Come on!!! They don't even mention Oliver's dad's list from season 1. Direction of show has completely gone off track. Does Laurel even practice law anymore? Her character is awful and her fight scenes ridiculous. Only good thing is Ollie and Felicity. FLASHBACKS need to stop. Enough is enough. Bring back Roy. Get rid of Atom. He is atrocious and so is speed talking new employee of Felicity. Get back to helping individual people of Starling City and to original premise of show. It was huge hit first season. Don't fix it if it was not broken in the first place. So disappointed!!!!! Ready to turn channel permanently!!!
