God, this show just doesn't get better...

When I saw the IMDb ratings I thought I should give the show a try, I mean it had an 8+ on IMDb, and I don't typically watch anything below 7. Alright, so apparently the show must be for someone else than me, because after starting to watch it nothing justifies the good scores.

Okay, so I kept going hoping that I was missing something - or maybe the good stuff just came later? But I'm now in the middle of Season 3 and I have never wasted as much time as I have watching arrow. Who wrote *read "stole"* that plot? It's not even stolen very well, as it is obviously much much worse than any similar vigilante plots out there, and you just after a few shows you will know exactly what will happen next and think to yourself "No they wouldn't say that or do this, cause that would just be dumb, unoriginal and lame" and then BUM, it happens and you get so embarrassed for the director.

Honestly, more than half of the episode I had to look away of embarrassment. God I really don't understand how this show could get more than 5.5 at maximum.

So here's the main points: - Incredibly bad acting - Plot is stolen directly from other novels & movies, such as for instance Batman - Hell even Ra's Al Guhl is in it, which is a monstrous disgrace - Editing mediocre - Not even the action scenes are good - No original "bad guys" either - What does it do good? Well, I guess... I think I saw a Lamborghini Aventador somewhere in Season 2. Alright, 2 stars - 1 for the Lambo, and the other for the ability to fool such a large audience and somehow make it this far without being a total flop. Beyond my mind to figure out.

Stay away! Don't waste your hours. This show isn't even good for a rainy day, unless you've already watched everything else there is to watch. And even then, I'd consider doing something else that's more exciting and less predictable - such as playing chess.
