I have actually watched just about all of the show that has been released. I am not writing my review after watching ten minutes of the pilot and deciding it's crap. I really kind of liked the idea behind this show. I heard some people complaining about the lack of realism, but come on, it's a superhero show, a little unrealism ought to be allowed. Upon watching the first few episodes, I kinda hoped that like lot's of great television shows, the actors and writers just needed a bit of time to get into their groove really find their characters. Once that occurred I reasoned, the quality of the show would start to pick up. So despite my initial reservations I kept watching and waiting... and waiting... and waiting. It just never happened. The plot has remained unimaginative, static, and predictable; the actors are wooden and unsympathetic, and the writing is overall just a train wreck. I could honestly predict exactly what the actors were going to say next. It pains me to see this truly mediocre-at-best show get the rating it has received. I will attribute this injustice to the fact that the actors are incredibly pretty and the assumption that those giving this show a good rating would have their brains explode upon watching some quality programming.
