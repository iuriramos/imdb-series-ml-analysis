This back show is terrible. They have the "spoiled rich boy coming back to take vengeance on the evil rich friends of his parents" which plays well to the Obama-era class warfare, but little else.

The core seems to be: If you got rich, you did evil to get there.

Really? He can't fight crime, he has to be on this vendetta crusade? Plus there is the whole thing of the constant flashbacks to his life on the island brought in every episode. (Couldn't just tell us the back story in one episode?) 

This is such a disappointment after "Smallville" was brought to the network I had a hard time watching it.

Bad scripts, bad plots and acting that would do 1966 William Shatner proud all top this off.
