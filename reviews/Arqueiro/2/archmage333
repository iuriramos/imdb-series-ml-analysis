One of the lamest, most unconvincing pieces of video material I've been subjected to. 

My step-son said it was good so I gave it a try. It's shite. I've loved comics since early childhood so it's another reason why I thought this would appeal to me. It's so repugnantly fake I'm at a loss for words.

You'll be hard-pressed to find a moment where you can get immersed and forget that it's obnoxious actors on screen that you're watching.

I just don't know what else to add except to speculate what made it receive 8.2 rating from the audience. Women drooling over the protagonist? Kids into parkour and commercial tunes? I'm baffled.
