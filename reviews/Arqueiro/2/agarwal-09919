Except for its first season the show is no more any hero story just pathetic sex and city type and while reaching 4th season only thing that remains is killing and resurrecting lead roles.It makes you even on an account of thinking about your time and money waste.Much sillier plots can have amazing show but this gives no intention to watch further. Why do you just have to revolve story around silly natters of relation among the lead roles instead of a hero doing at least a bit productive.It's just a silky drama for people to watch and cry until no reason has left in them.No thrill or action just a story of a man of who is rotating among his friends and family problems and has no time for good action.
