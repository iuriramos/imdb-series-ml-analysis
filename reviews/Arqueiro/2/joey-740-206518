If you can look past the horrid acting, the more than just lacking substance plot and the under developed characters - this series is for you. But then again, if you watch something based on the leads six-pack, somber mood and distant stares then you will love this poorly created series. Personally I prefer stories of substance, a tale with progress, characters and a protagonist that has more going for him/her than just a pretty face or/and chiseled abs. It is hard to believe that Arrow has survived critics and audiences and has made it to a renewal of a second season. It's sad to see quality writing i.e Smash be removed from channels and hogwash such as Arrow be allowed to fill the mind of the average intelligent human.
