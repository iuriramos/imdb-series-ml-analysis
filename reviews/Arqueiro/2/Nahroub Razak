I came here to check the reviews and I was mislead. So here I am, hoping that people will see this and not bother. First thing that you notice is the bad acting(personal opinion) and man that is annoying.

The show itself is decent but not much of plot development and the story is repeating and boring. So unless they have something hidden that is gonna blow our mind I'm gonna have to stop watching this show. If you have a lot of time to spend you can watch it but don't expect much from it or you will be very very disappointed. Another thing that hits you after a couple episode is the over the board acting with punch line here and there. 

I know it sounds like a lot of hate but just so you know this is my first review in IMDb I always come here to check some of them. This show is overrated and doesn't deserve the reviews in here.
