After seeing this get a good rating I took at shot at watching it.Right now, my faith in humanity has dropped a whole bunch if this is what they think is a good show. So in fairness, I figured to press on and go into season 2 to see if it was a context thing that would make it better. Only to find the show went from bad to OMG brutally bad in season two.

How can one listen to a supposed superhero whine for hours on end and not want to throw a rock at the monitor? After a while my eyes glazed over and realized this show is missing a Y chromosome really badly. The acting is some of the worst I've seen in some time, the script writers should be taken to the woodshed, and the characters are as thin as one could ever imagine.

My wife had a great summary of this show. She said it was like The Green Hornet had a child with one the Kardashian sisters and gave birth to a green whiney superhero who needs acting lessons. However, the real villains in this show are the writers and most of the actors. Shows like this never get cancelled yet the really good one never get a second season.
