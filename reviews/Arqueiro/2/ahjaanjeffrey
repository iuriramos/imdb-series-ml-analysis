OK when I first started watching this show I thought it would be worth following. And it was for a while but this show, like The Flash has gone so far above imaginative reality I just can't take it anymore. And oh by the way, we are now in the 4th season, it's about time to stop doing the stupid flashback scenes. This show has become one for a young preteen audience and the mentally challenged. Thank goodness what's her name destroyed that pit. It was one thing when it healed Thea but bringing people back to life and the sad attempt to weave magic into the plot. Pathetic. And IMDb some shows just are not worth 10 lines in a review. This is one of them. Lighten up a little.
