I really do not understand how this show has an 8.1 average. Sometimes it is so difficult to fathom how the writers came up with such a clichéd TV series. Now don't get me wrong, I am all about clichés and cheesy dialogues but this show has taken all of those aspects to a whole new level with an extra strong added ingredient of "stupid".

For example, Sara Lance comes back to Starling City, and just because she wears a tiny eye mask, her own sister cannot tell it's her? And what's with the cheesy "Mirakuru"? It would have sounded much less cheesier if they had called it "The miracle drug" or something like that.

Another example, is when Thea Queen get's kidnapped by Slade. If you get "KIDNAPPED", you'd be fearing for your life. I mean did Thea know that Slade was not going to kill her when she was first abducted? She would have been quaking in her boots and traumatized, to say the LEAST. Yet when she is let go, the only thing she can dwell on is the fact that Oliver didn't tell her the truth about her father? Really? Wouldn't she just be happy that she "STILL HAS HER OWN LIFE"?

Things like this keep bothering the hell out of me, and the ONLY reason I watch this show (albeit while biting down on my tongue), is because I want to know how the story fits with The Flash, and all the good TV shows have been watched already.

If you don't care about whether a TV show makes sense, or care about storyline, or decent action, then go ahead and watch it, but for me... I'm awestruck at how stupid a show they can make.

Some GOOD TV shows I can recommend:

- Person of Interest

- Da Vinci's Demons

- The Blacklist

- The Flash
