This is a true zombie fest, the undead have made a television show and to underline this, I ask the question: does anyone ever stay dead on this show? I mean, how would we know anyway? I imagine if I was a zombie, this would be the show to try out for, or perhaps as the show runner, or as a writers....wooden, stumbling, desperate. I suppose if you're watching this on TV, the commercials would come as a relief. Or perhaps the zombies are holding families of the writers hostage and making them write this show, makes sure the most wooden actors possible are cast, or the best actors at acting really badly. Again, it's on netflix, which is usually a pretty good sign that it will be pretty awful.
