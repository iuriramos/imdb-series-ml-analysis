I'm so happy that they are using ARROW as a way to spin off new DC heroes...the way they did with SMALLVILLE! I just wish they would consider dyeing Grant Gustin's hair blonde so that he REALLY looks more like Barry Allen from the comics! We fans do care about these things!!! Please add your voice to support this idea if you care also! Thanks!! I know the show must think that it's a minor point that doesn't really matter much....and I agree that the ability of the actors to act is MORE important than just his looks....but since hair dye is such a simple alteration these days, it's a modification that doesn't even have to be an issue if the show runner is aware that we care about it!
