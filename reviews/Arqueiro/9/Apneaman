Just get rid of her. 

She is just awful. Her performance is one of the worst things i have ever seen. I really like the series but come on. I am sure i don't have to got into detail and most of you hopefully feel the same way as i do. She is killing the show. How can anyone be taking her serious. She trains a few months and becomes a superhero. (Just one of my reasons) Bull...t. As soon as she appears i skip the part especially when she meets her dad. And she appears far to often in my opinion. It's like watching a soap opera vs Teletubbies. For the rest of the show. I really like it. It is definitely not my favorite but somehow you get stuck with it and you have to keep watching. So Yay for the show and nay for Cassidy
