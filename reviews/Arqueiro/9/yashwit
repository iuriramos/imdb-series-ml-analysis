I don't regret it. I don't regret hopping on the Arrow viewer boat in Season 1 and seeing those amazing fights, visuals and character driven plot I don't regret sailing through Season 2 and seeing the emotion, memorable villain and the nostalgia-driven plot I don't regret sticking through Season 3 and continuing on the journey even if the viewership boat was approaching a storm. There were flaws but the villain, story and relationships kept me glued Season 4 was a big hit to the boat but being a fan, I kept going and unbiasedly appreciated the attempt at Arrow's new but risky approach in its plot and style Season 5 , I get to laugh at the people who jumped off the boat because they thought it was sinking. Arrow has made an amazing comeback. Heart throbbing acting, nerve wracking suspense and a certain brilliance in the directing and story writing comparable to the Dark Knight. I don't regret it
