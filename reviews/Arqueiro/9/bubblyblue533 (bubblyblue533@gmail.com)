The pilot at first was a little disappointing, but after that, I was hooked. The whole ambiance and flashbacks to the island are incredible! My favorite things are the little details in the show, Oliver and Thea's relationship, and thankfully Felicity Smoak, a much needed refreshment to the berating Oliver Queen.

Stephen Amell does a wonderful job trying to keep up his facade of a billionaire, but in what I have read about him being similar to Christian Bales portrayal of the Batman, Amell and Bale are COMPLETE opposites. Stephen really leads the show, with a great cast supporting him. 

John Diggle played by David Ramsey is Oliver's "sidekick", but their 'bromance' makes me laugh out loud. Thea, Oliver's little sister played by Willa Holland also does a great job being the little rebellious, damaged sister, exactly as I would have imagined.

One character, Roy Harper, played by Colton Haynes, is quite mysterious, and I REALLY hope they expand and deepen his character's emotions and background. He doesn't seem like anything special yet, except for his romance with Thea, which seemed to be really sudden..

This show really appeals to many age groups of both genders. It does have the occasional cheesy line, but other than that, the action scenes are phenomenal, the camera work is incredible, and this is such a great show overall! I definitely recommend it!
