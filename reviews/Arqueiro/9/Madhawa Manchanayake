This is a very good TV show.I have seen in many years. The main thing which i like the most about the arrow is the story. I know some people say that it's a copy or a old story. But any way it's interesting to watch. Also the best thing is, this is the beginning of a new team of superheroes like in avengers. They are making arrow,flash and going to combine them into a new TV show called Legends of tomorrow. Believe me it's going to be awesome. CW is killing in TV industry even though they aren't successful in film industry. And I know it's kinda unreal. But it is enjoyable. The cast is also perfect for the story. I recommend this TV show to anyone who enjoy action and superhero shows.
