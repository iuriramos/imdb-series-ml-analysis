I haven't usually liked CW's shows, but 'Arrow' has really changed my mind about this. Basically Arrow is about this rich kid, Oliver Queen who wastes all his time and money with women and cars. One day his father invites him to go with him on a cruise. Oliver brings his girlfriend, Laurel's sister ''Sara'. There he cheats on Laurel with Sara. The 'Queens Gambit'(The Cruise) sinks, with only Oliver surviving. Before the fathers death, he gives Oliver a list. If Oliver would survive, he should take out everyone on that list. He finds an Island where he has to survive by any means necessary.

The show starts 5 years later, where he has come home. He starts a dobbel life, where he partly is "The Hood", who is wearing a green outfit and hood. He also uses the Bow and Arrow as his main weapon. The Hoods objective is to take out all people on the list his father gave to him.

As Oliver Queen, he tries to reconnect with his family and friends, which is very hard for him since he has become a Whole different person after the Island.

Throughout the series, there are many flashbacks from his time on the Island, which i actually find one of the most interesting parts of the show.

All in all this is a great and interesting series, where you can see how much such an experience on an Island, where you have to take care of yourself to survive can change you.
