This amazing television show brings everything a fan and viewer could possibly want. Every episode has left me on the edge of my seat desperate for more. Stephen Amell brings Oliver Queen to life in a hard gritty fashion. Every week I try to anticipate what will happen next, with little to no success. From the first tier stunt work, to the amazing characters. The actors and settings, I personally cannot praise Arrow enough. If you haven"t had the opportunity to catch Arrow yet, make the time. You will not regret it. Currently as Season two rolls on in spectacular fashion I am left with a hunger for more. And Arrow delivers, more heroes, more villains and action that if this writer had hair it would be raising. Keep up the good work.
