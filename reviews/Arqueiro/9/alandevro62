This show is by far my favourite show on television. It's a great new take on the green arrow storyline. The way they handled this new batman type green arrow is so great. The villains are perfect and so are the story lines that are used. Stephen Amell is perfect for the role and in my opinion is better than Justin Hartley. In fact the green arrow used in this show is better than the one used in smallville overall. After watching this show I would be really excited to even see a movie based off of this. A lot of episodes were handled extremely well like seeing red for example that is my favourite episode because of the epic feel that they were able to add in. While I was watching this show I was watching smallville at the same time and I have to say I prefer this show so much more. So I would definitely recommend you to watch this show the whole way through because it's just going to get better and better.
