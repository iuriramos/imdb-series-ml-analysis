I have always been a huge fan of comic book superheros. The whole cast for The Arrow, is honestly perfect! I haven't really have had any disappointments with the show. It contains the perfect amount of romance in the show. I say that because I get mad if the superhero I am watching gets to caught up in the girl. I am watching a superhero! I want to see him/her save the world! I see the romance as a bonus! Another great upside of the show, every time I think I know what is coming I don't. It keeps you on your toes, at the edge of your seat wishing this was real life. I hope to see this show lasting at least 10 seasons if not more. I hope that is in their goal plan. The Green Arrow is forever!
