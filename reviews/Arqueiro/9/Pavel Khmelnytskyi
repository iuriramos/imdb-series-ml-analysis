Actually, I don't like movies or series about superheroes. It looks for me boring. I had thought like that before I saw ARROW. I felt myself like a boy, uncovering new worlds. Good scenario, nice and smart artists, amazing legendary story about island. Now I know that not all stories about superheroes are boring. Perhaps it's because this hero more human, then superhero. He looks so seek as for superhero and haven't enough power to deal with problems very fast. He is very lucky sometimes, but it's part of incredible legend. Also he can be a good instance for fitness fans. In any case excellent project. Good luck, ARROW.
