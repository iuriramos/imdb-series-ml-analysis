Great...Really Great in TV Series World...Only 1 Star is less because of this described below...

But Why this Great story has unbelievable behavioral pattern. It is obviously feel that even matured superhero keeps secret a thing which he should not and gets result as worst And also accept after every time that I should have told earlier (Most spoken Dialog after You have failed This City Dialog in Whole Season). Lets think its okay for 1st time but frequently after this he is doing same mistake which is mismatch to matured character (Even Child can learn that this should not be done again). Also Laurel & Thea making mistakes every time and didn't learn things from their mistakes which is also feeling an Idiot to me watching this And in this scenario Arrow knows what is right and wrong and even after he forgives and not doing any precautions or making strict steps which must be required like it was a child's mistake. Make it real if you have such a great story and Superhero. Arrow can't be loser in this normal action after surviving 5 Years. Everyone keeps secret from each other and also alleging each other when others secret comes out. They are not children to unable to evaluate this even by series of experiences. Laurel & Thea are always making things worse and Arrow is not learning from this or even doesn't try to them not doing again.
