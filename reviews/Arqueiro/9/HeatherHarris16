I was extremely happy to find out that there was going to be a series based on the character Green Arrow from DC Comics. In many ways this show portrays what I like to see out of that character, but in many ways it does not portray what I would like to see out of the city and the people that Oliver Queen is involved with. I realize that there was supposed to be a difference between the character in the show and the one from the comics. Me, being as comic crazed as I am, would love to see the character AS IS from the comics. I think that Oliver was perfectly casted, more so then the Green Arrow from Smallville, but I also think that there were some horrible choices in the casting for his family.. that being that his mother is still alive, that he has a little sister "speedy" and that I just REALLY DO NOT like Katie Cassidy as Dinah "Laurel" Lance. I think that the creators and writers of this show took it a step too far in keeping his family around and also introducing "The Huntress" as someone that Green Arrow meets on one of the episodes and decides to "train" I think that they made a lot of horrible choices for the storyline of this show.
