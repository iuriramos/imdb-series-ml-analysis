Full disclosure - I love superheros. That being said, this show has reminded me what it is like to love an actual TV show. I am excited every Thursday to find out what happens next. The story is great, the action is great, and the main characters are, for the most part, great. A couple of times every episode I am reminded that I am watching a TV show on the CW. That being said, the show is entertaining enough where it doesn't drag me out of the story and suspense.

If you enjoy superhero shows or movies, you should definitely check this one out. It is definitely a new leaf for the CW network, and it is a great one.
