This show is a breath of fresh air in terms of vigilante stories that I have seen. The story is compelling with fantastic acting although at times it falls short of the mark in some fight scenes where it seems as though there should be more injuries/casualties.

In terms of seasonal quality I feel as though "Arrow" only improves each season it airs. Season One was superb and I felt as though it would decline in quality but it just feels as though it is getting better and expanding so well. The actors in it are spot on too, they put the characters across well with their physique and to this point I haven't found any faults with the acting. 

Overall the show is a must watch at the moment if you have enjoyed any sort of Superhero movie/show in the past and a must watch in general if you enjoy action TV shows.
