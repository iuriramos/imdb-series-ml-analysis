I wasn't expecting much from this show in the beginning, but I was pleasantly surprised. The scenes are short, tight and pack a punch. There is rarely a slack moment and the plot lines have considerable emotional resonance. As is typical of CW shows, it's full of gorgeous twenty- somethings with perfect cheekbones and impeccably coiffed hair, but that's just a bonus.

In two seasons, Arrow has gone from strength to strength. The villain-of-the-week episodes are now interwoven with long-running story lines. Some of the second season episodes--Keep Your Enemies Closer, Three Ghosts, and Tremors--stand out as some of the best pieces of television in the last seven or eight years. Though they occasionally veer too far into comic-bookiness, the stories have become even more compellingÂ—in fact, sometimes I even wish there were more character scenes and fewer fights.

It never ceases to amaze how the showrunners manage to squeeze the maximum out of a TV budget every single week. Not since Miami Vice has there been a show that aimed for--and so often achieved--the ideal of a TV series as an hour-long mini-movie, delivered once a week for the viewer's delectation. Often big-budget Hollywood movies feel bloated and weighed-down by all the money spent on special effects; Arrow is freed, its creativity stimulated, by the need to work within a smaller budget. The visuals are gritty and imaginative and the fight scenes are always wonderful to watch.

Unlike most CW shows (ahem, Smallville) which aim for a more emo sensibility, or the angry-young-man nihilism which afflicted Nolan's Batman movies, Arrow strikes a more mature tone. Themes of loyalty, revenge, love, honor, family ties, sibling rivalries, friendship, betrayal, Oedipal struggle, motherhood, absent fathers, guilt, redemption, class struggle, the dichotomy between the mask one wears and one's true self, and more--pulp fiction it may be, but treated with loving care by the writers, showrunners, and actors. This combination of heightened emotional intensity with the comic book mythos elevates Arrow to something like opera: a world of stylized, epic, larger-than-life conflicts, but which is still recognizably human and compelling. And it's addictive.

The powers that be at CW have fortunately renewed the series for a third season and I'm eager to see if they can manage to take the story of Oliver Queen to new heights. I hope the show runs as long as they can make it interesting.
