Initially, I had no expectations on the show whatsoever. After viewing the first episode I thought the show was satisfying, good action, good story, but unrealistic, and too much like Batman. By watching more and more episodes, it becomes clear why that is that oliver queen is that strong.

Just Finished watching First season and just watched 5, 6 Episodes of 2nd Season and Em surprised to watched every episode second season is full of thrill and entertainment.

For me personally "Arrow is the best series on television. I can't wait for more!
