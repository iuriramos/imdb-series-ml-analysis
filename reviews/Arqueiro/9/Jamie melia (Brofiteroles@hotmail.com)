I love this show, always have, always a will, it's what first got me into watching live action comic book to shows and films. Everyone's character is awesome, and as long as Oliver and Felicity aren't going through any drama, him having a happy, healthy relationship is a fresh touch too. What I can't stand is Laurel's character, I hope Katie Cassidy is nowhere near a self-indulged/obsessed moron in real life cause it just means she's a tremendous actress. Someone could be going through the final stages of their death and Laurel would be there to say "but how do you think this makes ME feel?". You can literally predict when she's gonna be self-obsessed because she makes almost all topics about her. I want you to play a game for me, well two games. 1. Drink every time she manages to swing a subject so she becomes sub-topic, and 2. Take a lick of your rum and raisin ice-cream every time she says "me" or "I" and I promise you, you'll be wasted after 10 minutes. I only mentioned rum and raisin ice cream because of the low alcohol content, so the statement should be supported by its own legs. Anyway, Arrow is amazing, and I don't mean to sound harsh, or callous, but I'm glad the character Laurel is dead because I hate the sincerely self-obsessed/indulged/righteous, the ones who truly get upset and screechy because the person in hand wasn't thinking about them for once. I realise this was more of a rant than a review, but I've speed watched seasons 3&4, and it just got to me.
