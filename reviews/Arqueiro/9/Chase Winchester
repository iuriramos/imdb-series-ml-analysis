Stephen Amell brings us a more serious Oliver Queen as opposed to the obvious comparison from Smallville (where Justin Hartley, while amazing, wasn't the leading actor and thus the character's story wasn't as much emphasized). 

While it doesn't completely stay true to the comics it still portrays the characters amazingly and the cast is superb. The show doesn't only bring DC Comics fans a lot of familiar characters, but also manages to incorporate the origin story in a wonderful mix. 

After one season I can say that it is one of the best comic-book series out there and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a more serious series around comic-book characters who kick ass and yet bring a lot of emotion to the table.

The show doesn't have a lot of comedic relief which I usually appreciate in serious shows, but It's harder to review a work-in-progress and I look forward to seeing what they are planning to do next. The writers definitely know what they are doing.
