I must admit, I did not know where this show was going in the beginning. Now I have to say, this show has become one of my favorites. I really hope we can get at least 6 seasons or more out of this one. Probably the best show aired on the CW. I don't get to watch a lot of TV at the time that it is broadcast. I mainly download episodes from torrent sites. So I really hope that torrent downloads add to the ratings. Great acting, interesting characters, action packed, and Felicity Smoak is SUPER HOT. Other reviews that I have read seem to reflect the same views that I had before giving it a chance to develop. TB
