I was never keen on the poster and the Green Arrow wasn't high in my hero list but I must admit I was gripped by this show with it's premise and it built up nicely with characters and plot revolving around a few central stories. It was nice to fresh faces in the cast and not full of plastic actors. There definitely was a good mix of twists and turns in the plot and I really like the flash backs. Each episode holds on it's own as well as revolving around a central theme. This paves the way for other hero shows and look forward to series two. I would like to see more of a cross over with other DC characters to open up new shows as well as pave a way for the justice league.
