I used to sell comic books as a kid. I remember Mike Grell's Longbow series well and how it greatly matured the Green Arrow. The CW network has taken things in a slightly different direction now (missing the Sherwood Florist LOL) but this interpretation stands just as good as any. At first I thought the acting was a bit stiff (Stephen Amell) but it was complex and consistent and grew on me.

Well done, that's not easily achieved.

It's a comic book show based on a comic book character, remains true to the heart and soul of the story it's based on and doesn't disappoint. Not super-smart but entertaining nevertheless.

Edit: Episode "Seeing Red" was just aired in Australia and caused me to move my rating from 8 to 9. Excellent script, excellent story with unpredictable twists and good humor.

For a small-network production of a comic story, "Arrow" has more guts and more grit than both "Agents of Shield" or "NCIS New Orleans" hands down.
