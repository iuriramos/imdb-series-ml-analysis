Arrow began on a rocky start, poor acting/script made it appear really corny but once it found its feet the series became addicting as the past is unfolded episode by episode and how it impact the current events occurring. The acting is constantly improving although it does have its corny moments the action scenes are well executed and finished. The series sticking closely to the comic books is clever as it does allow some greater explanation of events that occurred. Overall the series is great i would highly recommend this to anyone that wants something a bit different to superheros with superpowers. Arrow is a great series and it works well with the cast, I'm glad to see the Daredevil series has taken the same approach as arrow using a deep back story of the past to make the story line more appealing
