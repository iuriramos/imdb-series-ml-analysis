Well one of the few things I dislike is the fact that Deathstroke's been reduced to a henchman in this show. I mean I won't pretend to be a comics buff, but from what I've heard, he's supposed to be borderline superhuman and is an expert in tactics and battles, and is more of a 'mastermind' character. In this show, although his appearances are small, it's a noticeable flaw in his character. Other characters seem to be decently developed. Story line is fresh. A milestone in TV superhero shows. I'd like this show to tread carefully, however. There are lots of shows with amazing first seasons, but then got cocky and messed up the second *coughWALKINGDEADcough*
