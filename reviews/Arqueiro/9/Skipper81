So Arrow Reviewed in one word: Fantastic

Each season out does the last. The flash back scenes can be a little annoying but they do a good job showing Oliver's change from playboy to vigilante, but on reruns I generally fast forward through them. I am curious to see what happens after season 5 when they run out of years to flash back on.

Felicity Smoak and John Diggle are great characters. Good villains too which is a must, heroes never seem heroic with inept or pathetic villains, Manu Bennett, John Barrowman and now Neal McDonough give stellar performances Stephen Amell does a great job as Oliver Queen.

A really well made series.
