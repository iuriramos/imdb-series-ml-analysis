I must say that is very good, have excellent adaptations , in fact the character of Ra's ghul has a 10 , did not give it excellent because even without being disguised as much notice your makeup, but as for the series think it has much filler but from there on out is an excellent series and highly recommended , my favorite character is Felicity :)

I think history and how they have been engaging characters is great, to say the crossover are sensational and the fact that competing is sometimes fantastic , subtracts emphasize that I am waiting for the next season , in which I hope to surprise me with the following but no enemy character who appears on the scene.

I know it's difficult to do this and continue with the relationship between series but I trust the writers and have not been disappointed , make a micro universe which has grown and I think the cast could hardly be better, my best wishes to the series.
