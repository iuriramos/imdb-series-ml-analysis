Its been long since I dumped the Smallville as it became awful somewhere from season 7 or 8. It had an Oliver Queen too. Now, this guy from"Arrow" as Oliver is aggressive and passionate about what he is doing. The story begins somewhat in a usual manner but then moving with nice pace of twists and revelations. It could be boring if you think too much about it, but for a regular viewer looking for just fresh "superhero without superpower" entertainment, you have a winner here. True, any other character except Oliver is not detailed, they are just out of the box, but the real character is not them, hence its understandable. Acting is a vital point here, Stephen Amell does a real fine job characterizing the Green Arrow. Paul Blackthorne is great as a cop. Other characters such as Colon Donnel, Susana Thompson are doing nice too. Its a nice superhero series, you will love it as I do too. I give it a 9/10 for the nice time pass. Cheers.
