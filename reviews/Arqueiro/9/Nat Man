If you have followed some of the DC story lines and are familiar with their assortment of characters (not the big guns), you are in for a treat. Especially in Season 2. 

This is not a super-high production value movie like Marvel comes out once in a year. This is a TV show that lets you in on some of the stories of a multitude of characters in the DC universe... and I definitely find season 2 interesting.

There is even Flash, Leagues of Assassins of Ra's Al Ghul, Solomon Grundy, China White, Deadshot, Deathstroke...and not to mention Green Arrow's girl in DC..the Black Canary.

There are some soap-ish drama involved that sets you off track from the action...but thankfully this is not excessive. Recaps of how Queen became Arrow sparsed in between every episode is short and kept at a minimal but interesting pace. And true to the DC universe... people seldom die. It is a good time pass. Not a serious, gripping whodunnit or drama...but has its own genre of fun. 

Hopefully DC is building up for a JLA movie soon
