The very First episode was really good and after that no-one was able to stop me from watching it for hours until I watched till season two ! Great Series and LOVE IT !

Keep up the Good Work !

They did a great job on making the 'Arrow' series ! But I did not like, Laurel Lance as a character, not being rude but, she is really bad/a b***h !

But the rest of the characters are really good This the first time I have seen a good Action/ Adventure series after a Long, long, time.

I just hope they publish their episodes a bit more frequently !

P.S. can you include some other villains also ! Please !
