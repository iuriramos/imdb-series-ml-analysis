This is the first TV series after Batman in which i saw the great superhero without superpowers, But no doubt the the role is brilliantly performed by Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen.

I was the great fan of Green Arrow from my childhood, i used to buy and read its comics. I remember the day when my girlfriend gifted me the Green Arrow Leather Jacket on my birthday just because i was so crazy about it, by the way thanks to the Fjackets.com for making just a fantastic outfit.

Overall this show has just getting better with every episode so i've got high hopes for it the next few seasons.

Green Arrow you Rocks!
