After Smallville I approached Arrow with great caution. However this turned out to be a very all around TV series, much more evolved than Smallville in terms of quality of the production. The hero is not perfect, he learns and develops. Flashbacks are much more than a glimpse of past, they keep you wondering and the way writers tie past and present events is masterful. Stephen Amell is not only a great action star but his mimics and tone of his voice really gets to you. You can clearly see the difference of his tone when he is the "Arrow" and when he was the kid before the island. Even the main villains like Slade Wilson, Malcom Meryln and Ra'as are quite likable characters. The only irritating part in this series is Katie Cassidy's performance on Laurel. I'm not sure if the writers are deliberately portraying her like this but I'm very happy that Oliver Queen was not stuck with her as a lover for the rest of the series.
