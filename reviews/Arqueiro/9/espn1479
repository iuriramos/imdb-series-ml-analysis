the show is absolutely perfect its dark,edgy and exciting!this city looks like its corrupt from top to bottom everyone looks like there involved in something there not supposed to be in involved in and its great,i see a good future ahead for this show.there's only one problem i have however how does he get the paint off his face so fast and clean? i really think they should switch to some kind of hi tech cool looking kind of glasses.i mean think about it, he turns into green arrow he has to stop and paint his face and when he has to go back he has to stop again and clean his face without leaving any evidence. they could do better! can't wait for the next episode!
