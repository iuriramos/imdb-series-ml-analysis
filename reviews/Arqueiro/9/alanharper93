Everything about 'Arrow' so far over the course of it's first two seasons has been pretty much exceptional. From the acting standards of the main, supporting and recurring actors, all of the effects visual, special etc. the sound mixing amongst everything else needed to produce a T.V show. Not to mention the fight scenes are pretty bad-ass and will have anyone intrigued. The on-screen chemistry between Oliver and many different females is clear for all to see which again leads me to praising the acting abilities of all involved. To me, becoming emotionally attached to T.V show characters is what tells me I'm interested in the show and also that it is worth watching and most likely a great series, and I'm certainly emotionally attached to some characters in the 'Arrow' series. With each episode offering something different and most certainly a few cliff-hanger episodes, 'Arrow' is one of the best shows out there at the moment in my opinion.
