When I first started to watch this series, I thought I would watch maybe one or two episodes. Never been more wrong. I saw the first Season in a rush. After the end of Season one, in which Oliver Queen couldn't save the whole Starlight city, he finds himself on the island he was trapped again, to recover from all the difficulties , that have happened. I think the second season will be even better, the rivals are getting more equal and the whole story is less predictable than the first one. Also that with almost every episode you learn, that his lonely island was actually everything else than lonely... I like the flashbacks more and more, as they reveal the reasons and the process of Oliver which show, why he became the man he is now.
