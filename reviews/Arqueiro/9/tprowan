I love the show and haven't missed a minute of it yet, but that may change. The last episode I watched left me a little flat. Oliver Queen, who lived through five years of hell, hid from a death squad on a deserted island, did personal training with a man who was too dangerous to keep in prison, works out like an Olympian, is the best archer in the world (?), somehow gets his ass handed to him by some suit who works in an office?

It's pretty inconsistent when some shmuck off the street can take out our super hero at his own game. Either he's really really really good or he should hang up his hood. Don't make him into a loser who's the third best archer in the world and only a few girls can beat up. Make him exceptional or lose some fans. We really don't need another soap opera.
