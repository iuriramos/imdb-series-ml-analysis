I can't believe the incredible polarity of the reviews for this show! I was a huge comic book fan when I was younger (quite a few years ago, I admit) and Green Arrow was one of my heroes. I am loving this adaptation! OK, it's not 'Game of Thrones' as far as production / writing / acting values go, but it is damned entertaining and takes you along for a fun ride. Come on, you knockers, it's a COMIC BOOK for goodness sakes! Stephen Amell is a good choice for the lead and I personally think he's a good actor (check out his creepy performance in "Justice for Natalee Holloway), maybe dealing with less-than-riveting scripts (yes I agree, some of the dialogue is cheesy - but I stand by my 'entertaining' comment). Besides which, I applaud the priorities of the production crew, which have him bare his amazing physique at every opportunity (we women need a bit more eye candy!). Couple of negatives - not enough of the wonderful Colin Salmon, and what's with the green eyeshadow instead of a mask? This must surely be a bit of a nuisance when he's doing a quick change and I know he conceals his face wherever possible, but as a disguise it's pretty ineffectual (though I suppose nothing is as bad as Clark Kent/Superman's hairstyle/glasses transformation - was Lois Lane blind as a bat, lol)?! I'm also getting the vibe that it is going to evolve into more of a soap opera if the story lines keep up their current trend, instead of concentrating on the action - but we'll reserve judgement on that one. If you haven't already, give this show a go - if you're not expecting Shakespeare or BBC classical drama and just want to be entertained, this could be just what you're looking for!
