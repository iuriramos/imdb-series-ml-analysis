ARROW is one of the best series i met with.those who watching just to watch how it is going they don't like it better. but those who watch it with interest it is the best show.i gone through all the seasons and episodes strictly speaking am kind of strongly addicted to this series the plot of the series is like all the series, to save a city from criminals.actually it is a parallel story series in which two stories of our hero ARROW (Oliver Queen) runs parallel. a story of present and a story past five years.he didn't possess any superpowers like any other comic superheroes. he has some extraordinary skills learned in past in that five years. there are many connections between the past and present stories in every episode.Sometimes FLASH and other superheroes are seen in ARROW.Finally,am about to tell that i love this series,and hope you will love it if you have understood the theme of this ARROW.
