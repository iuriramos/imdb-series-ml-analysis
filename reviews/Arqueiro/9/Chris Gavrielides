I do not usually write reviews but maybe for some bad criticism from other people I would like to state my opinion. This show had a really bad start but after watching some more episodes the plot holes and everything started to get wrapped up... I really like Stephen Amells acting as he tries to be both a rich billionaire and at the same time a deadly vigilante. The only thing that bothers me a little bit is the bad written villains that appear on the show...and I think it gets fixed on later episodes... I hope that it will somewhat blend with other DC superheros in the near future.

Just give this show a chance and you will not regret it.
