I will be honest. I am not a guy who gives every movie a 10 star rating just because I found it funny or just because I like it, neither I am a pro-reviewer, I am pretty sure about that.

The only reason I am reviewing this TV Show (the first one also) is because I can't get a proper reason of why people gives Arrow a 1 star rating. Simply can't get it.

Yes. Arrow may not be perfect, but hey, you all know that it does not deserve a 1,0 rating.

Arrow is undoubtedly one of the best shows in the actuality. I think the beginning was pretty weak though, but even if you dislikes it, while watching every episode you will get as entertained as you wanted to be with this show.

It has a very good point to keep you entertained and wanting to see the next episode, it is that mysterious island where Oliver was found alive.

The fact that Green Arrow does not have super- powers make this show even more interesting. It was good too see some kind of a batman legacy on the screen again, despite batman keeps ruling DC's world.

Another awesome thing they did is putting another well-known DC's superheros on the show, which makes Arrow even more and more interesting.

Arrow has became my favourite DC's superhero with the only and one Batman.

Looking forward to an Arrow movie when the show gets to an end.
