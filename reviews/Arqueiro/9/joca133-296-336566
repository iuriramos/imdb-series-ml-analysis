Nice to see him again, huge farscape fan.

This series is getting increasingly interesting, with the right amount of action (gotta love stealth and archery), intrigues, very hot women and a good crime/thriller stories with flashbacks and all. 

I also hoped to be able to see less of Amell half naked and more hood, maybe more Willa or Katie with less clothes could level the field a bit or else just leave the shirtless thing to twilight saga or other teen soap opera.

There are several small stories running in parallel at any time: sister x drugs, ex x friend x hood, mothers role on the boat accident and other dark things, the island... so I see lots of potential, I just need there is someone with a clear head to direct this on a good path.

For now I will keep watching and I hope it becomes a favorite for me. I recommend to all who like superhero/detective/crime, a bit in the line of Grimm, def. better than smallville kind. I hope they don't cancel it too early.
