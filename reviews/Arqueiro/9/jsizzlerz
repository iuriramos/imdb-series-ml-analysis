Arrow immediately captured my attention from its pilot episode. I knew it would be a fresh new take on DC's Green Arrow. From day one it has had great stunt work and a very enticing story to keep you guessing until the very moment you find out. Oliver Queen's yacht is destroyed in a storm and Oliver barely makes it to the shores of Lian Yu where this remarkable story begins. Throughout the events of this show(currently on season 3) you will see very many familiar faces from DC's rogue list and you will witness some great character development. I know, some of the actor s can be a bit questionable but honestly Arrow always makes up for weak points by slamming some intense scenes before us all. Overall, if you are a fan of Justice League or DC in general you must give Arrow a chance and i assure you, you will enjoy it. I rate Arrow at a 9.3/10 (Latest episode was S3E02)
