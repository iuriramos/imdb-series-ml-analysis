Arrow, a show about the beloved comicbook character, Green Arrow/Oliver Queen who is a spoiled billionaire that's missing and presumed dead when his yacht is lost at sea. He returns five years later a changed man, determined to clean up the city as a hooded vigilante armed with a bow. But will he stay the anti-hero called The Hood or become an epitome of hope for Star City becoming the Arrow?

Each season we lose and gain characters, some portray their characters really well and some are really annoying. Multiple deaths occur in every season, some deaths are really satisfying and some really tragic.

The great thing about this show is that it shows Oliver's 5 years on Lian Yu and around the world through flashbacks in every episode which are really entertaining and sadly sometimes more entertaining then the present plot.

The plot of each season is different although there are several 'villain of the week' episodes but we always get to the big bad of the season. 

The show takes inspiration from The Dark Knight trilogy but isn't a rip-off. The flaws of the series is that it's sometimes poorly directed and has wooden-acting, like a lot which is annoying.

The action in this show is great, especially when a character, mostly Oliver, is using a bow and arrow to shoot an opponent. You'll want to grab one of your own and shoot someone.

Arrow isn't the greatest superhero show but it definitely opened the path for future shows such as The Flash which is a spin-off of this show and Legends of Tomorrow which is also a spin-ff of both shows plus several other shows.
