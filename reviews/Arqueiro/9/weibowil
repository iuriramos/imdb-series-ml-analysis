Loved it.. watched all 46 episodes in less than 2 weeks! (and stayed up last night watching 8 episodes in a row!)

Season 1 was exciting, but in Season 2, while the writers upped the stakes ante; during the last few episodes, Oliver/The Arrow began to become really foolish in his decision-making :(

"Your reticence to do what is necessary, is why your city burns!" To me, Nyssa summed up Oliver and Season 2 pretty well.

While i love many of the supporting characters like Felicity, Roy, Sara, Tommy, Detective Lance and Diggle, it was really annoying to see how the skillful Oliver Queen turns out to be such an elementary playboy, (he actually slept with his father's mistress!!) and making more and more useless decisions that leave dear ones suffering. A disappointing lead character to root for.
