"Arrow" has very strong scenario, not very experienced but successful actors, good actions.

I watched all episodes, and I always get excited and surprised. I always wonder other episodes.

Our main character, Oliver Quenn, is really charismatic character. He plays his roles very good. He fits his role.

The scenario... very exciting, surprises me every episodes. I can say it is one of best scenario for a series.

If you like stealth in a film, or you like a strong scenario, I advice you to watch "Arrow"
