...what the hell happened on that island. If you're hooked after watching the pilot and you're anxious for it to continue, then you know this is a keeper. I was pleasantly surprised by this dark and more realistic approach, maybe a bit like Nolans batman franchise. I don't know the comics so can't really tell how close it is, but it works for me. The pilot offered quite some tension and didn't reveal too much at once, yet enough to catch your interest.

The main character is charismatic an believable, though being a vigilante who's dropping quite some bodies I found myself really liking this deeply troubled and damaged guy. I think there's quite some potential here for some very interesting storytelling. The supporting cast works well too, some are too clich√© but let's just give the writers more time to develop them properly. My only real complaint so far has to be that our hero dodges way too many bullets without getting seriously hurt, I hope they'll move away from that and keep it a bit more realistic.

Apart from that I think this is the best new show of fall 2012 with a lot of potential and few issues. I hope the writers keep things interesting and flesh out the characters some more, but this show definitely got my attention and is worth watching.
