With a decent premise (Though hardly original) and good writing punctuated by witty dialogue this series is of exceptional sophistication. The poor quality of small-screen drama has become mystifyingly evident in recent years. A lot of the action in the pilot was also beautifully choreographed.

I read Green Arrow comics as a kid as well as its tie-in The Black Canary. I recognize the names of many of the characters and can see where they might be going plot-wise in future episodes. But they have revamped the back story with a vision that suggests the one Christopher Nolan took in making the Christian Bale Batman movies and I find it quite agreeable.

The future of the show will obviously hinge on public appetite for scripted episodic TV. The evident affection for lame reality show singing/dancing auditions of homely, talentless twits eager to make fools of themselves remains depressingly high. Hopefully this show will find and keep an audience.
