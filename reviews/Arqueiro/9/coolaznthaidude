During the first season I'll admit I found it rather unimpressive and strangely off putting to have a superhero kill off bad people. I made the right decision to stick with the show because it truly is one of the most brilliant comic book inspired shows ever. Despite not having superpowers like Clark Kent in Smallville, the action in Arrow is much more entertaining and riveting. The show has a pretty serious and dark feel to it, and keeps you guessing with every scene. The villains are surprisingly well developed as well. This show touches upon some romantic elements but doesn't make it a central theme. If you want true unadulterated superhero action and story this is the show for you. If you want to get into a new show, you can't go wrong with this one.
