This has proved to be a very interesting show and it has a brilliant story line. After the eighth episode of the first season i feel episodes just keep getting better. It does not follow the comics or the original green arrow story but it is till amazing. Originally black canary ( Sarah lance ) is supposed to be Dinah laurel ( her mother ) but that would be before green arrows time so in his time laurel ( Sarah's sister ) decides to be black canary in green arrows time. Also in the show Oliver Queen chooses his hero name to be arrow instead of green arrow. It does not follow the original comics completely but all in all a brilliant show
