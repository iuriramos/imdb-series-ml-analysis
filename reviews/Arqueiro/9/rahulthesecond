If you expect a movie like experience out of arrow, you're probably gonna be disappointed. But if you see it for what it is; a not-so- high budget entertainment series, you'll find it quite entertaining. Some fight scenes are a bit cheesy, and there a quite a few plot holes, with some good and some bad acting, and the writing has slipped a bit since season 3 started. but otherwise, it is quite a decent show, worth a watch. Actor Stephen Amell plays the role of the main superhero/vigilante Arrow, which is based on the DC comics superhero Green Arrow. The tone of the show is pretty gritty and the show is quite batman- esque. One of the better CW shows out there. Season 1 - 9/10 Season 2 - 9.5/10 Season 3 - 7.5/10

Overall - 8.5/10
