Okay, I really don't get the negative reviews, this show plays on the CW, what do you expect, Band of Brothers or something? Everyone knows the CW's thing is entertaining romance/drama story lines with occasional action aimed at young adults and teens. You don't go into a McDonald's and ask for a Taco just like you don't watch a CW show expecting phenomenal award winning acting and a poetic script with some deep underlying message. The show is very entertaining, the action sequences are done surprisingly very well, and I actually like the characters, albeit they need a little more development and more facial expression options. The show does its job, it keeps me entertained and anxious for the next episode. Remember kids, you don't go into a McDonald's and ask for a goddamn hot dog.
