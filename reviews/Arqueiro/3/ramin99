To say this is a mishmash of different things is an understatement. Robin Hood and Batman are the two obvious ones. Now let's look at some more things that come to mind: I was first thinking of the video game Assassin's Creed, but Thief may be more of a match. The Bold and the Beautiful because of the romance and relationships; Baywatch because all the people shown in the series are good looking with nice bodies. Given that three quarters of the North American population is either overweight or obese, this is extremely unlikely. Now, I was thinking of King Kong the way he climbs skyscrapers, but then I changed my mind and went with Tarzan, the way he dangles from ropes and swings from one building to another. I couldn't watch all of season 1 and I skipped all the flashbacks on that Island. I guess this is for younger audiences, as for me I got tired of it fast.
