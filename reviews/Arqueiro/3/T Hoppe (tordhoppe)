This review is from the perspective of not having read the comic series. It only concerns the pilot episode of Arrow season one.

After having watched the first episode of the show I was left with a feeling of watching stereotypical characters, plot lines and character motivations. The, formerly, douche bag playboy Oliver Queen have the need to right wrongs caused by his father(?), but can't show the world his new, true self. Especially to his ex girlfriend, who he cheated with her sister, because if she gets close to him she will get hurt by his soon-to-be enemies. Obviously he longs for her, but his vigilante heroics have to take precedence.

His family can't be bothered to travel to their son/brother that's been missing-presumed-dead for five years. His mother shows up when he's been checked out at the local hospital. His sister glides down the stairs when is brought back to their mansion and exclaims how much she's missed him. Olivers ex is of course fighting for justice in the "proper" way of using the law as a tool as opposed to Arrows use of illegal force to get things done. Her father also happens to be the detective that investigate all the Arrow-events that somehow seem to gravitate around Oliver Queen.

The series is based on an old comic series, but in this day and age I'd hoped that the producers could do something to create more believable characters instead of cartoon stereotypes. It clearly shows the drawback of using established IPs.
