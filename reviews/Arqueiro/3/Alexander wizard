As i don't want to write spoilers, i wont give many details. 

This is my opinion IMHO:

The show starts quite good, i had fun for most of the first season. The second season was kinda meh, and had some lame parts, but was OK overall - that mirakuru stretch was just awful - BTW why didn't they invite bane? If you had hopes that the show could get better and not worse, wait for Season 3 where the story writing really goes downhill to a point that it's unwatchable, the chapters are 40 min long, moistly half of it is soap opera like talking and planing. Many things he could have done solo, now he needs the help of 2 or 3 friends just out of convenience (like fighting some random bad guy) Pretty much anyone can use a bow and arrow as its super easy (sarcasm), and also suddenly everybody becomes a fighter, even Thea - this is so lame! And BTW, oliver is a real jerk, he couldn't even give felicity the bottle of wine he promised in the first season (yes, this bothers me). 

Overall the directing is bad and amateurish, the show is very lame and stupid, inconsistent, has bad acting like a bunch of wax figures (mostly oliver and laurel) bad outfits, lots of clich√©s (like the bad guy that talks too much). Also the show is more like a soap opera and that got on my nervs - i don't'care about so many details of olivers sex life, of who is dating who, of all the flirting. Isn't this a superheroe movie? or is it a superheroe soap opera??

I Coulnd't finish season 3, and i will not watch further.

well, you get the idea right? if you like a smart and interesting show, with good writing and acting, skip this one.

if you didn't already, then take a look at shows like continuum, chuck, torchwood, daredevil, burn notice (just to say a few).
