The first few episodes are good in that we learn the hero's back story, his need for vengeance and teasers on how he became a weak playboy to a fearless, strong vigilante. We also meet a few characters that are sure to be future heroes/villains as the series develops and the episodes delve into each character's backgrounds and current/future interests. This show suffers from a dramatic screenplay as the main and side characters worry about their feelings much like a soap opera or elementary school playground would feel. Add to that the unreal and overdone effects of cannon fodder enemies that can never hit anyone with any type of gun and a ridiculous concept that a normal bow can withstand the blow of strong kicks or swords and still fire with 100% accuracy. The show literally had a few gang members toting semi-automatic guns, firing at Oliver nearly 10-15 yards and could not land a single hit; but, Oliver always gets injured by the main enemy or a much less harmful enemy/neutral character. I would still stand the plot holes and ridiculous action scenes if it weren't for the acting and soap opera feel. Sorry, but I do not find Laurel attractive at all and the show always tries to capitalize on her as eye candy. As though they want to distract the male audience with the elephant in the room of bad writing, acting and let many drama scenes play out.
