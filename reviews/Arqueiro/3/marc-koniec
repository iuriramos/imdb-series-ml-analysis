This has gotta be the most clich√© filled, predictable piece of TV ever created. Acting is subsidized with whispering since the lead cannot express any emotion what-so-ever. There is maybe one good episode per season. 

I understand that it's not supposed to be realistic, but sometimes it is just funny stupid. After the first seasons it actually goes downhill. After bombing us with the fact that the villains at least seem fit (like muscular and ripped), in the third they are straight out fat and display it instead oh hiding behind a bulky outfit. The characters change their mind with little to no reason at all, most of their decisions being just chosen at random (I assume), since they have little to no relevance to comic books, upon which they are based. Plot seems like it's written by a 5-year old. Really the only good thing to say is that the camera work is great. The shots look really good even if the set does not. 

I can't believe it has so many fans and such a good reception. There are cartoons based on comic books with better character development, plot and realism.
