There's not just a single season for why this series could have a higher than 4 over 10 rating, well perhaps the only 1 reason could be that u just never saw a really good series.

Starting with the story and plot that develops so predictable and immature, without any real drama or suspense, and a regular to fake action sequences. The script is full of clich√©s & weak lines that complement the bad acting from almost all the "actors" starting with the worst one: Stephen Amell the protagonist. If that's not enough, the FX, lighting, song choices, even the wardrobe and interiors design looks and hears cheap, without any kind of quality in the whole thing.
