I mean the TV show is a great idea, green arrow is a good supper hero but only in comics, making this real life looking like a bad copy of smallville TV series and batman, specially batman. what I don't like about this series is that this series is filled with a hero or vigilante who continuously makes the wrong choices and is emotionally a wreck and hello! a pleyah a bizillionaire <- batman copycat, but he goes throw countless gals not having the main one unlike every other superhero. The drama is just making the whole show seriously boring, he just does things in the same pattern never changing his tactics or strategy, at least batman is badass and even tho smallville had lower rating it was still better than this show.

PS: I don't know how I got to ep10 s02, i feel like a wasted ours on bullshit :)
