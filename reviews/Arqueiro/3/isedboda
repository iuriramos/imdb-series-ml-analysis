Possibly contains spoilers if anyone else started watching this as late as I did: 

I just started watching this, got about half-way through the first season, but I won't be finishing it. As many others have stated, it's like watching a soap opera. Oh my, the wah-wah drama! 

The best friend who hasn't grown up one iota in the last five years, still wants to party like they did in college. (But didn't the show state that Oliver dropped out of every college he attended?) But he is going to manage Oliver's club, even though, apparently, no one actually learned anything, but we are to believe they know how to run businesses.

Then you have the ex-girlfriend who's sleeping with the bestie but wants the cheating back-from-the-grave ex. This same damsel-in- constant-distress who says she can take care of herself and her job, until she can't, which seems to be every time; she just can't seem to get out or her own way. (BTW, just how did this girl, her sister, the friend-with-benefits who is now a cop, etc., get into the billionaire- boys-club in the first place? I never read the comics so I would really like to know.) 

Then you have her father, who also can't get out of his own way because he must get that vigilante. Gets a tip of a major crime and all he can focus on is getting that vigilante.

The show could have had promise with better writers and directors. I give the actors a break as they are playing the scenes as written and directed. I think they all could have done better if they had a better crew behind the camera.
