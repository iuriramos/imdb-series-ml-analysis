I was hesitant to write this review, but because for some time now follow this show, I decided nevertheless to write.

Show was interesting at first, entertaining although it encountered a series of boring episodes. Also, the constant repetition of "I'm here to protect you" which repeats at least 5 times in each episode is really annoying. 

Dramatic effects are poor... I really do not like forced scenario, only for dramatic effects. The culmination of the drama queens is Thea Queen. Her acting is pretty bad. Similar is with Felicity whose role is "funny", where she is a hacker, doctor, engineer... and she is not look like that at all. How she hacks and doing her job is at least ridiculous. 

After watching the first episode of season 4 I completely lost interest in this series. Everything turned into hog wash. I almost fell asleep. Dialogues are so bad, skinny Thea throws heavy people in truck like they are made of paper...idiocy. The idea that everyone wanna be super heroes in general does not make it interesting and is very boring. the characters have lost their meaning and role. No character is no longer interesting, even Arrow. 

Just a pity that there is material much better, but they blew it with excessive drama and stupid (meaningless) dialogues. Boring...
