First Season awesome, gave it a 9. It had everything, with finally an (anti-)hero that wasn't afraid to deal out an eye for an eye to the psycho killers out there. Now its turning into just another pansy series, with way to much drama and relationship troubles and hardly any action. Trying to hard to get a 'family' audience.. instead of sticking to what worked so great in the first season. Very sad.. I stuck with it, hoping it would turn back around. After seeing episode S02E07 though, I've giving up hope. Worst episode so far in my opinion. For me this one went from a 9 to a 3. So my advice to u, if u haven't seen any of this series yet, only watch season 1 and leave the rest to your imagination. Taz
