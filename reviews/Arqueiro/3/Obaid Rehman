People train each other and the student magically becomes awesome at fighting within a couple of years at max.

Surprisingly everything is linked to Oliver's past. 3 seasons have passed and Oliver's "hellish" flashbacks do not end.

After every season Oliver decides to quit his life as the arrow but eventually comes back to star city.

Katy Cassidy's acting is annoying. Furthermore her character is stupid. Captain Lance's character is also very annoying.
