So I've see 8 episodes now, and this is it for me. The story line is trite and predictable, the acting is sub par and the hero is frankly an idiot.

I've seen people on here talking about how this is an "alternative" take on the vigilante/superhero story, and that it's mysterious and dark and to that I say: really? Have you seen ANY TV? Because this is neither "alternative" mysterious or dark. It is down the middle of Bland Road to Boredom..

There is literally NOTHING, no really, Not. One. Single. Detail. about this shot that is original in any way.. All I want now is for the "hero", his family and his friends is that they are locked up for life for being awful at everything that they do... Really.. If not for the decent production value this would be a less entertaining Batman (the one with Adam West). Don't waste your time on this.
