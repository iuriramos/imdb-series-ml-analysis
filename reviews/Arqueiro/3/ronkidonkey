With each passing moment whilst watching 'Arrow', my jaw dropped a little lower; 20 minutes into the first episode I could hardly stop laughing. The overall performance by the cast members actually hurt to watch; the static acting is bad enough as it is, but the script is really what got me. Listening to the dialogue filled with cheap-one liners, bad jokes and the predictability of the upcoming lines makes the show unbearable to watch. 

It's safe to say that the plot may have some potential, however experienced viewers of the superhero genre will be able to make an educated guess how to plot unravels. 

I wouldn't suggest watching this show, unless you don't mind bad acting, and are a huge superhero fan.
