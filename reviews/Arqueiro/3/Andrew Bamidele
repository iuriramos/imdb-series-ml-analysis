Unfortunately, I would be heartless to give this film a zero star rating but that is about all it deserves,thinking of some people actually wasting time to do this saddens me. There are lots of things to criticize about Arrow starting from their inoriginality down to the excess exaggeration.What surprises me is how the producer did things that made me wonder if there was actual thought put in the production especially the death of Thea and the rise of Sara.Another thing that spoiled the series apart from the relationship with laurel lance was Laurel herself.She kept on doing things that were poorly thought to say the least,in addition to developing super fighting within such a short period.Luckily for we viewers I heard she died which automatically earns a plus on the producer side unfortunately the damage had been done. Irrespective they might actually have a shot to bounce back, Afterall aren't all superhero films enjoyable ?
