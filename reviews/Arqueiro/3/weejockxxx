I watched this show for the first time yesterday after catching the appearance of Oliver Queen in an episode of the Flash, which I like. The premise of Arrow is a lot darker than Flash, which I have no problem with but the whole experience for me was marred by the appalling sound. Whole conversations were lost because the music was louder than the dialogue. I don't know if this was a one off or if it is a trademark of the show but it put me off completely. Why do the people in control of these things think that loud music is necessary? If, like me, you have a hearing impediment, it can be hard enough picking out dialogue. When you factor in loud music it makes it almost impossible. My rating is based almost completely on that fact.
