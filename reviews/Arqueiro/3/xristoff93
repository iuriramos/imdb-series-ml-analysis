I began watching this series with a friend and at the beginning it seemed quite promising.But after the first season it started turning a sharp down-turn.Every five minutes a new forced,fake drama emerges,just so they fill the episode with something.Oliver is presented as green arrow after suffering on a helish island and from then on everyone who dies is not actually dead and appears miraculously later.Many bad guys who die....don't die...They come back again and again.Everyone familiar with Oliver pushes him around as much as they want and he just sits there speechless....No one can learn his secret but almost everyone now knows it and since every woman in his life is either a super hacking machine or a skilled warrior in some form of combat and weapon using(and of course at some point,despite other relationships,his sex-mate),sara dies and they don't know what to do so we go back to the beginning,faking deaths,arresting oliver for being the vigilante and getting him off the hook again....He is a master of suspection,sniffing everything out unless it concerns someone he knows.Then he gets totally dump and does nothing until damage's done.... Poor acting of many protagonists and too predictable...Too much of repeating...
