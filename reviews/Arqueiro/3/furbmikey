I stomached S1 on Netflix and I mean I was laughing hysterically at the sketch comedy that occurs on the island scenes. I mean, that is just overtly cheese...The Bruce Wayne wannabe gets his ass handed to him by non meta-human adversaries on a daily basis. I have no doubt that trogs will continue to watch this trash and keep it on the airways, so unfortunately I will stomach the bad acting and mediocre plot line because I'm a glutton for bad cinema.

I hope the CW eventually merges this into the Tyler Perry universe where Oliver Queen is forced into slavery in an ironic twist and forced to marry his black bodyguard, who is a dude. 

In short, watch this at the risk of not liking it, and continuing to watch because network TV blows in general.
