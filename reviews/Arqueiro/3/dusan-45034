This show USED TO be great!!!

At the moment i am at the end of the 3rd season and i think i won't be watching the show any more. Writers have been doing their job very poorly and there are many flaws!

IF ANYTHING CAN RESCUE THIS SHOW IS FLASHPOINT! AND I MEAN IT! JUST GO BACK AT LEAST AT THE HALF OF THE THIRD SEASON WHEN NO ONE KNOWS AND ALL THAT STUFF WITH THE POLICE, IF IT IS TOO MUCH TO GO BACK FURTHER. IT WILL MAKE SHOW GREAT AGAIN!

There is no need for other side kicks than Arsenal!Only Arrow, Diggle, Felicity and Arsenal! Please !
