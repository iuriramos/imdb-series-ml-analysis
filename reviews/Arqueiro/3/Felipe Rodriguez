Of all 3 series of superheroes Arrow, Flash and Daredevil it comes in second for my taste Daredevil is the best of the 3. Arrow gets so stupid for a superhero character , guy goes on a boat with his girlfriend sister, comes back and his best friend is on a relationship with his ex girlfriend, Oliver gives an advice to his friend to fight for the women he loves but that same night sleeps with the girl and off course his friend cries but doesn't give up his secret, then sister comes back from death sleeps with her,and he also slept with the daughter of an enemy with his CEO. His mom is all about protecting her family but kills her husband and laurel character so stupid. I gave 3 because the guy from Flash and his love life its more stupid. Action is good they just should stick to it.
