If someone put a clip on the nose of Emily Bett Rickards she couldn't speak a word. Thompson is the only female who knows how to project clearly. This ruins the entire series, for me. Each episode is loaded with silly, unrealistic issues. Guards turning their backs on dangerous prisoners so they can escape, beating the law of averages by having every character dysfunctional, and police entering a dangerous scene without backup, just to mention a few. However, this is from a comic book, so, I guess, this is doable. The constant flashbacks are really distracting. And, I'm not buying, "I get two plots for the price of one."
