This series is really not my kind of stuff : it's clearly make for children. "Heroes" that can rebirth, killed but never dead, injured and wounded but always standing up, etc... I have seen the 3 first seasons because of my ex-love-interest was watching it every Wednesday (at 11.30 PM!) when it was aired in France on TF1. I was so bored watching this thing I often fell asleep in front of the episodes ! I just don't get the point. Superheroes series can be well-made. But this one is dumb. If you like it, it's just fine. But I really don't and I won't see the 4th season when it'll be aired in France next summer ! And please, the acting !!! Come on ! Start acting, not taking poses for the cameras ! I think that's why the producers chose Amell : good looking for teenage girls... who like models ! But an actor ? For sure: NO ! He still has to work to become one ! Arrow ? Never more for me !
