the story(i mean the all idea nothing else) is good as hero story ... but nothing else 

bad acting , bad director(s) (how many ? know anyone? every episode have a different director ? or i make a mistake!!!!)

bad script , bad soaping scenes the movie created like a 1970-80 movies many many many director mistakes ,many many many logical mistakes ... and in some scenes i thing that i watch the Batman !!! 

we have hero that he know EVERYTHING ... the IT girl that know how to analyze a poison's and create CHIP's ... OK ... i must found new job because as IT i don't know how to do these !!! 

2 arrows of Malkom hit the hero in back and make 2 holes in lung ... but nothing happen , he go to hospital and after hours is ready ... nobody ask about the 2 ARROWS !!! 1 bullet in i place that nothing destroyed and he "almost die" !!!! 

he try to hit Helena from 1-2 meter ... arrow from 1-2 METER ??? r u kidding ??? and she catch the arrow !!! who she is ???

the camera man show the hero to be away some meters in one scene and in the next the hero is in 1 meter ... because the angle change and we can see that the position are WRONG !!! 

the hero super ninja loose from a old man Malkom , he loose from Helena that he say she is terrible ... probably the director's don't know the previous episodes ... 

phones with out cables on desk's ... but talking , an arrow in the eye not hit the brain is this possible ? NOT !!! the director not have idea how these things work !!! 

the Shara is maybe the only actor but under bad directors

the only good is the all idea (so i must use my fantasy to create the "new" series in my head and not waiting from the producers) 

what else ? don't loose your time ... i loose mine !!!! very very bad production .... sorry guys but we are not a vegetables !!!
