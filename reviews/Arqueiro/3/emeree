This is my first ever review of a show/movie of any kind. This is a not a series worth watching unless you have some extra time on your hands. There are just so many better options out there. I really gave this show a chance and wanted to like it. I made it halfway through season 2, but I just cannot do it anymore. 

The overall acting is very poor throughout the series. There are maybe two or three characters whose acting is decent. Between the stiff acting and cheesy writing, I find myself cringing a handful of times while watching each episode. The plot is simple enough and easy to follow, but there is nothing new and amazing (even for someone unfamiliar with the comic book series such as myself). If you are looking for quality acting in any superhero based series on TV nowadays, The Flash is your best bet.
