Unfortunately, the writers have failed this show. Arrow used to be fantastic. I looked forward to it every week. Watched it as soon as it was out. Now I'm not sure I want to continue. Season 4 is the worst by a long shot. It's so bad that it's made me question whether I liked Arrow in the first place. Pretty sure I did. Seems like DC is really struggling to make a good show these days. Flash is still pretty good. Legends of Tomorrow is mediocre and I'm having a hard time caring about the characters. With Daredevil and Jessica Jones on the Marvel side, and Fantastic Four / Man of Steel / Batman v Superman / Supergirl on the DC side... I'm seeing just how far downhill DC has gone, while Marvel has gotten continually better (and had a good starting point).

The writing in Arrow was good in s1-s3. By s4, it's just gotten cringeworthy. The whole Oliver/Felicity dynamic used to be pretty good. Now that takes about 80% of the attention of the show. It was good as a side-plot - worth about 5-10% of the plot. CW has turned it into a cringy romcom/drama. Not a superhero show.

If the writers don't fix this show, I'm done, and so are countless other fans. Just look at the reactions to the last couple episodes.
