This review is for people who watched the first 3 episodes, like myself ...

Never read a comic about Green Arrow but i don't think its this bad. Maybe its because i just finished watching "The Sopranos", not sure ...

Don't know where to start ... 

This show is very hardly believable, even for a superhero show. Queen was at the island for 5 years, learned two foreign languages, became hacker, scientist, martial art master, technician, bow master and probably lots of other stuff, best superhero need to have, yet to see ... He set up a lab, made all the gadgets, hacked into FBI, CIA, Interpol database, made a suit, alone, unseen, in a first few days ... Not to talk about stealing $40M from the bank account using only his arrow ... I mean WTF????

This was all from the first episode. Shortly, its very bad show, can't believe it has 8.5 rating. Really? Its a disgrace for all the other great shows out there. By the way, I rated it 3 only because of Katie Cassidy.

Maybe its only my opinion but I will not watch it in the future.
