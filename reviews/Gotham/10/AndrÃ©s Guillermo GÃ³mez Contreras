I really like all the DC Universe, and the story of the heroes and how they became what they are... Seems to be a common factor now with DC series now, which started with Smallville, and kept going with Arror: first you see the characters as people, then you see them as heroes OR villains. This idea intrigues me a lot, and this series in particular has something that just drives you to it that separates itself from all the others. Probably Batman is the most famous of DC characters. But in this series is not Batman who matters. Why? Well, Bruce is there, but he is quite young still, he just lost his parents, so he doesn't participate in the plot so much. He is still far away from the masked man we all love and enjoy, he is just taking his first steps. So we get to see other aspects of the city. We see Gordon. We see Selena. We see the Penguin (by far, the most interesting character up to the moment). We know them as a consolidated character in the universe, but here we see how the city, how Gotham forced them into what they all will be. To me though, the most interesting thing is that it explores just how wicked Gotham is, how much Gordon has to struggle to be a part fight not only the criminals, but a corrupted system, and still try to be honest with his beliefs. Though this is really something that we will see through the whole series, I can't wait to see how it evolves when more villains, like the Joker, Mr. Freeze, or Bane, appear. Only problem? I believe that this series is going to be long. I mean, REALLY LONG. But if it wants to stay true to the story of Batman, and introduce as many characters as the Batman universe has, then we need a lot of episodes to do so. And the result, I believe, will be worthy. If it means to show Gotham, I stand it being long. Just hope they don't prolong it with pointless extra stories like they did with Smallville. They have something big going on here.
