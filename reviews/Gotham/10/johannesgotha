i'd like to point out that i'm not really a DC guy. I have always thought that Marvel was way better. However, this show really catched my attention. Everything about it is great. The stories are great. The action scenes are great. The characters are great. 

And this show also maneged to make characters that i previously thought were kinda boring like Alfred into awesome likable characters. Like, Alfred in this show is a real badass and probably my favorite character.

If you are a person that loves sci-fi, fantasy or superhero media you will love this show.
