The Nolan films rescued Batman from the silliness of the 2 Batman films b4 them. Burton's "Batman Returns" belongs aside Nolan's (& the uncredited Frank Miller) "Dark Knight Trilogy".

Bruno Heller is miraculously doing what Nolan did. He is reinventing the Bat-mythos. This show is played like "NYPD Blue" or "Hill Street Blues" with some colorful characters. It is light years away from the idiotic series of the '60s. It may not be as "heavy" as the Nolan films (which I love), but it is clearly not meant for kids. It is a bit lighter, but just a wee bit. It shouldn't air at 8.

EVERY single element of this series soars. The writing, casting, acting, production & editing is the type that I expect to pay HBO or Showtime kind of bucks for (and I would). It IS that good.

AMC has "Better Call Saul" & Amazon Prime has "Bosch" currently airing. "Gotham" plus these 2 shows are shockingly good. For those of us who mourn the departures of Leno, Colbert & Jon Stewart (coming) from late late night these shows are candles in the dark.
