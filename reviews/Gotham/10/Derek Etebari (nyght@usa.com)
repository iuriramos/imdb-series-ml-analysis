I don't care what anybody says -- this series is AMAZING! Especially if you are a Batman fan.

Yes, there are certainly parts of episodes that do make you roll or eyes, but I have a question -- is there a show that doesn't? OK, maybe Breaking Bad didn't, but really...are there any other shows?

This series was VERY well done IMO. I would love to see the people down rating this series have done it better themselves. Easier said than done.

Anyways...very entertaining. There are several episodes that are really gold mines -- eg: the season finale (WOW!).

Enjoy.
