I'm in love with this show! That's the first thing I'm going to point out, the second one is that I am a fan of this TV show without any knowledge of the city, the plot, the characters, overall the comics, just it happens before Batman arrival's. In general, I saw a lot of fans criticize the fact of some characters appearing destabilizes the time line, the «crime of the week» material, overall I guess a lot of people are thinking that Batman are going to appear in this show and all that. But I'm going to admit it that I don't care if Batman is going to show up, or anything, I'm really in love with the «crime of the week» material, I love these type of shows (Castle, CSI, NCIS, etc). I really like Jim Gordon, and I'm so excited to see how he is going to handle the second season, because season one, was breathtaking for me. Some good twists, full of battles between good and evil, and always lead us to a new level of insanity. 

I love this show, I'm really excited with the second season arrival and I really want to know how the writers are going to explore new plots, because now the they have freedom to do what they want with the characters and don't have to be restricted to the story, to the comics.
