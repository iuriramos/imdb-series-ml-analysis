I was really curious if this series would become what i hoped. I am a Batman fan and even play the games (Batman Origins, Batman Arkham City and Batman Arkham Asylum). I had my doubts being a prequel? I hardly watch television and don't watch crime-series (like CSI). They don't keep my attention. But from the beginning to the end i was completely taken by Gotham. I love it. It fits perfectly in the Batman movies and the games. Real great fun to see how it all started. They made up a believable story. Seeing a young Gordon and Selina Kyle. Gotham and the corrupt Police department. Trident, Falcone, Oswald, Harvey... One of my favorite series already. The atmosphere, story, environment. It all holds up to my expectations and what i request from it. Great play by all the actors. 10/10 for me.
