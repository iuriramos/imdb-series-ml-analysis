I am a big fan of comic books, superhero movies and TV shows. Arrow is my favourite. But Batman is my favourite hero. So when they announced a TV show set in pre-Batman Gotham, I was downhearted. No Batman in a Gotham show? However, I was wrong. 

1. The acting in Gotham is excellent. Jim Gordon reminds a little bit of Daniel Craig's Bond - that gritty, rugged man but with a sensitive side. Jada Pinkett Smith as Fish Mooney was another brilliant move. I disliked her at first, but once her character began to develop, she became one of the most charismatic on screen. And of course The Penguin: well, that actor is going to have a long career.

2. The fighting and combat isn't all superhero-ed up. No ridiculous out-of-this-world fighting. The combat is real and gritty, and everything you'd expect from a crime-ridden city. Brutal shootings, stabbings, torture, dismemberment. If you thought Arrow was dark, it is like Mickey Mouse compared to this.

3. EASTER EGGS! So far we've seen a young Bruce Wayne, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, and Jerome is looking to be the season's Joker. Penguin has also featured heavily. In one episode, at the circus, an acrobatic team called the Flying Graysons perform. And any comic book fan MUST know that Grayson is Robin's real last name.

All in all this show is for everyone (over the age over 14). Its a crime, action, mystery, thriller, drama, occasionally comedy. Even if you dislike superheroes, you might find yourself liking this film.
