I rarely rate movies 10/10, but this one virtually squeezed it out of me. The pilot alone keeps you at the edge of your seat and entertains you by the second. The series takes itself serious but not to the extent where characters become annoying.

The plot itself is so realistic and deep that you feel immersed into the show through out. The acting is very well balanced through out which gives the series some sort of freshness and I have to say this is among the best cast of a series/ movie I have seen in a while.

The sound tracks are great in a sense that it keeps the suspense up all the time. With the quality of the series, I can see it having a very long run possibly a dozen seasons or more because of how broad the plot could get.

To end it I would totally recommend this series to anyone looking for a show with deep story, fresh actors/ characters and interesting twists because this show has great potential.
