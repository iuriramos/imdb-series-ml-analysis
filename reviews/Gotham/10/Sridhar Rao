To create a TV show about such a revered and famous character in itself is a very courageous thing to do. James Gordon has been played by many people in the past but none compare to his portrayal in the Dark Knight series. I started watching this series because I like Ben Mckenzie. He did a great job in The OC and Southland but in Gotham he has given the performance of his lifetime. The tale is gritty, dark, beautifully written and pacy.Almost makes you feel as if it was a Nolan product. The sets are beautiful, the cinematography is breathtaking. You get to fill in some of the blanks. Even the origin stories of great DC villains like Penguin and Puzzler have been wonderfully portrayed. I would recommend it to every DC fan. Its a good story with mind blowing performances throughout. Watch out for the young penguin and fish mooneys characters
