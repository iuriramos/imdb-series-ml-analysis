My favorite show out cant ever get enough of it. This show and game of thrones are the two best shows out right now. The start was a little slow but intriguing. By the end of season 1 I was hooked. No episode is the same or feels the same at least and filled with surprises. Its great seeing the characters of Gotham unfold unto what we know they will one day be and guessing who will be who. The end of each episode leaves you wanting to see the next. Who knew Jim Gordon was such a badass. Often shows like involve detectives but hes by far the most interesting to watch. If there was ever a zombie apocalypse id want him on my team lmao.
