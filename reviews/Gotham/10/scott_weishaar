I really wasn't that thrilled with a show telling the prequel to the development of all the Gotham characters from Batman. How wrong I was. This show has done an incredible job of putting together the backdrop story lines to so many characters that feed into the Batman stories. The establishment, villains, all the events that made so many psychopathic personalities and of course the childhood of a boy that would drive him to fight them. The story has grown more intense with every episode as more character back stories are revealed. The show has a long life ahead of it before Batman even comes of age at the pace it is going. I adore this show and after binge watching the first season and a half am thrilled the second half of season 2 will be kicking off soon. They would be fools not to do a season 3, and if they keep their pace and intensity far more. For a show I expected little from, I'm flat out hooked and will suffer through the anticipation of more... only if more shows could be written to this level of quality. Like any show, I doubt it will maintain 10 stars, but that is where it is at now and one can hope!
