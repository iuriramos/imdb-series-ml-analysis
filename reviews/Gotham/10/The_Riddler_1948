Gotham is one of those shows you can hardly dislike. Its fight choreography, thus far, has been pretty damn stunning. Its actors who respectively portray their characters are absolutely wonderful (and, well, yes; all the characters are brilliant!). Its cinematography is beautiful and really adds effect to the show. Ben McKenzie and Donal Logue are tremendous as the show's main stars. Ben McKenzie stars as Detective James (later known as Jim) Gordon, and Donal Logue stars as Detective Harvey Bullock - and they portray their characters just nicely. 

The villains are splendid. They're awesome. They make the show well worth-watching; well, actually, they just add more to it, because the show is that damn good already. Sean Pertwee stars as Alfred Pennyworth, and rightfully does so - he's phenomenal, if you ask me. My second favourite ALREADY (yes, believe it or not). 

Overall, with its great actors and writing, its epic choreography and cinematography, its directing, set locations, and scenery, amongst its fantastic episode plots, Gotham jumps on the scene as one of the best crime-dramas in present day, and maybe even of all-time. Absolutely terrific. 10/10
