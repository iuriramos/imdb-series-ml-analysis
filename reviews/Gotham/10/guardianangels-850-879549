Well i have to say. I have seen A LOT of other shows and a lot were great as well but this show has it all. Great acting, i really like "the Penguin", but all the others as well. You never know if they are hiding some dark secret or not. Really guys and girls this is a great show. And to think i was never a batman fan but this is something totally different. Also Butch, Enigma, Miss Kringle etc. all great actors and have to congratulate also the writers. Great job. OK i knos others won't like the show and there is no show perfect. But i really would suggest watching at least 3 episodes before judging yourself. you can always blame me.
