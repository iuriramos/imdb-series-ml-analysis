I'm going to say that first i love the show its action packed full of fun and good mystery it's one of the best you can find today and I am a huge fan of it having said that though parents may have some issues with the show like the fact that the line of good and evil is not always easy to see here Selena is the main reason for this problem she is sweet and kind one minute then ready to commit robbery the next the penguin is also a good example of this he is not exactly sure what he wants to be and then detective Gordon has made his share of poor choices in life so it's good very good just a little confusing and certainly not for kids who can't handle violence and abuse and the occasional scare but a very good show
