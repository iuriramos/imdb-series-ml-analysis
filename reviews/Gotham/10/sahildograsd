As a die hard fan of Batman, I started watching this show even though people gave it negative reviews. I put aside the criticism and started watching it. To my surprises, I kinda liked it. I was addicted to it. Not in an obsessive way. I was addicted to it because it left us with a great suspense. At the end of every episode there is a new twist, which moved the story forward in an unexpected way.

Some people do not like it, some like it. It depends on the person. But the show is not awful. Some light-hearted comedy in between keeps us interested.

If you are a fan of Batman universe, you will like it if you watch it with an open mind.
