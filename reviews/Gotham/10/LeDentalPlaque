A lot of people have mentioned that Gotham is too dark, too complicated, and too overambitious. But I think it is one of the best TV shows to date. We've all seen countless renditions of the Batman origin story, but usually they are short-lived and we are brought back to grown-up Batman to watch him kick ass. Never has anyone embarked on a journey to bring Gotham to life before Batman was around. And never has anyone been so ambitious to focus on not just Bruce Wayne, but so many of his future enemies as well. And who better to encounter all of these baddies but James Gordon himself?

Yes, the plot of Gotham is dark and complicated, but that's what it has to be like in order to bring Batman's world to life. As a viewer, you are plunged into the Falcone crime syndicate, where various familiar characters emerge like Falcone himself, his rival Maroni, and of course, the Penguin (Oswald Cobblepot). Through their actions, other characters are pulled in like Selina Kyle, Victor Zsazz, etc. And from the Gotham City Police Department, you've got Edward Nigma as well. But James Gordon is what ties everyone together to make this show a success for DC fans. 

Through the eyes of James Gordon, the Penguin, and Bruce Wayne as a kid, you get to see how all of these characters slowly develop into the bad guys you see in the usual Batman comics or movies. Yes, there are a whole bunch of characters and more being added in each episode, but the fact that it is a TV show and not a feature film gives the creator and director time to focus on developing each character while giving viewers a fresh and exciting experience with each episode that airs. 

I honestly can't wait to see how these characters evolve into the villains or heroes they will be, and most importantly, it shows how many problems Batman will have to face when it comes time for him to gear up and take on the dark world of Gotham.
