The TV Series Gotham (2014) Season 1, I found to very well put together. I love how it followed the story of Commissioner Gordon during the times of Bruce Wayne in the early stages before Batman. The show is very well put together and the cast used for this show are outstanding. Each actor/actress pulled off their character very well which fully kept the show going full speed.

The Penguin is one of my favorites in the show, the actor held his character strong; stronger than most of the cast. The first season so far has my full attention as I will be watching every episode in hopes to see it stay rolling like it is. Of course after watching the whole season I went into a Batman Kick and had to watch all of the Batman movies again.

If you hadn't Gotham and are a Batman fan I highly suggest this show.
