I am very pleased that they have put so much time and effort into the origin story of most of the main characters in the DC Universe, the main thing I like most is the single episode origin story of main characters. The story behind enigma and penguin are especially interesting and Bruce and Gordon have an interesting story but for some reason I like the other two better. I am looking forward to more main characters getting involved in the back stories. The story behind Falcone and Maroni is quite interesting and I am excited to see what will happen to them in the long run, fish seems to play a large part in the success and failure of people in the series and she in an interesting character to follow.
