Excellent Show. I wondered how a show about Gotham City before Batman would be. Just finished watching it and it is outstanding. The introduction of so many characters was a nice touch. And the specter of what I perceive to be Catwoman is interesting. As for the opening, where else would you start it? The shooting of the Waynes may have been done before, but this was were to start it. I have been a comics reader since the early 60's and Batman was one of my favorites, so a story about Batman before he was Batman is perfect. I hope that they delve into the psychology of what made the Batman become the Batman. And the character of Jim Gordon is spot on. Hope to see it for another 10+ years.
