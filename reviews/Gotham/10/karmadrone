What to say... this it a perfect Prequel (for Now) to one of the Greatest Dc Comics character(for me).The premise is Fantastic! The character of Cobbelpot,Nygma,Selyna are Ansowm! I have one big hope! To see the Joker!!! Thank Bruno Heller for having fulfilled my wishes to see a series based on Gotham before The Dark Knight! now i only hope that will be more great episode like the pilot. Like i said the premise it fantastic so lets see what the evolution of the plot in a good way i hope! The Atmosphere of the series remind me so much of the one i always want in a batman transposition and it fit perfectly,another thing is the scene of the murderer of the Wayne's, the only thing i cant say it Thank you Bruno Heller!I hope this will go on because i think will be Great!!!
