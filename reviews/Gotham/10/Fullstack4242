This show is awesome for one main reason. It did not give in to the predictable family fun "safe" theme approach. It is not silly like Avengers or SHIELD series. I love the easter eggs that are in every episode. Clearly the writers have a respect to the comic book fans and not to the masses that want to see un-original writing, Clearly the writers of this show have an intelligence. Each episode eludes to whats become in Gotham. Usually I am annoyed by little kid actors but the young Bruce Wayne gets just enough screen time to believe the show is not all about him. The dark gritty plot lines do this show justice and it is a massive improvement compared to the crap that Marvel has put on screen or TV. I hope the writers keep up this pace and stick to the more adult theme. Cant wait to see this series go all the way. Hopefully we can go as far as to the birth of The Batman !!!
