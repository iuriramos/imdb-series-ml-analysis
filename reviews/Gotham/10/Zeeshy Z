hi. I'm from Pakistan. and i must say.. its really an amazing series. loved all character specially penguin and James Gordon... even in o.c as Ryann Atwood "ben" acting and character was awesome... if the rating were 1 to 100. even then i would have given this show max rating i.e 100. love the show. i hope the producer and directors keep the show running till batman comes in action. i hope. but then again its full of surprises. riddler is also nice but right now seems a dry character but then again don't know what he will do in future or how he become a riddler.. anyways again loving the series a lot and best of luck and keep it up James Gordon ;)
