There wasn't a single episode I've come across so far that felt dull.. 

While Penguin might be portrayed a bit different in the comics , Robin Taylor does an amazing job at being Penguin. Cory plays his part as Nygma on point as well IMO since he creeps the hell out of me all the time and his unpredictable nature doesn't help it make any less creepier, as it should be. Also hands down there could have been no other actor that fits so well for the character of James Gordon than Ben McKenzie.

On a side note, the villains in the series are just too good to be ignored. There's just the right amount of villains (including Nygma of course) that we love to hate and at the same time can't help but admire them (at least when it comes to me XD) .

This series is pretty addictive and you should definitely give it a try. 

Highly recommended TV series if you have time to kill.
