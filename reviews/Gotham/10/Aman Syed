Gotham is basically about how Jim Gordan along with his accomplices solve homicide crimes, etc. If you think it's about Batman, you're wrong. 

I was skeptical to watch this show, as I thought since Batman would not be there, it'll be boring. Well, I found it later I was so wrong. So Wrong. It got me hooked on.

I watched a couple of episodes and it wasn't too bad. I started watching more episodes, then I loved it. You really don't need Batman actually. Many villains come such as the Penguin, etc are there in the show . Penguin is portrayed by Robin Taylor ( Oswald Cobblepot ) . He surely deserves an Emmy for his acting. I also loved the acting of Cory Michael Smith ( Edward Nygma ) . He's bit a weird though, with all his strange riddles. Nonetheless, he is great. Ben Meckenzie did a good job in portraying Jim Gordon . I think the acting of Jada Smith was a bit too much. Sometimes it was just too bad but at times it was good.

Well, I must say Gotham is a very promising show. I simply LOVE it. I hope they also renew for many more seasons. Again, I would suggest you to watch at least the first three episodes.
