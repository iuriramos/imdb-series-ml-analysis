Wow, this show is awesome! Never in my life had I ever thought that anyone would be able to pull off a decent "prequel" to the Batman series...that is until now. The dark tone of this series is a perfect fit coming fresh off the heels of the Nolan-era films. I have also enjoyed the overall portrayal of many of the characters in the show, including Detective (not yet Commissioner) Jim Gordon, Harvey Bullock, Harvey Dent, young Bruce Wayne, his butler Alfred Pennyworth, Selina Kyle (Catwoman), Oswald Cobblepot (Penguin), and Fish Mooney, who, unlike the aforementioned characters, is not an original character derived from the comic series, but is rather an exclusive to this TV series. No matter. In any case, once you start watching this show, you will be hooked, guaranteed!
