well i have seen the two of latest episodes i think it is going great. 

I like this show . OVERALL VIEW

some of them are saying that the show is over rated and over hyped, but i ain't think so. because it is just like the comic and the batman is growing up!!

CHARACTERS

about BRUCE WAYNE

At first i have to say they are painting the childhood of bruce wayne.After the assassination of his parents the boy has changed a lot, he wants to punish those evils. so he is going to do avenge the natural fears that he have like he wanted to avenge the fear of high places so he climbed up in the roof of the wall and that tells us that how batman is perfect in these cases.nevertheless he is painting the bruce wayne character perfectly. 

about FISH MOONEY we can see how strong the criminal world is, fish mooney is powerful and she can do anything for her need.SHE HAS A GLAMOROUS PERSONALITY WITH A BIT VIOLENCE.

about SELINA KYLE I have to say I preferred her for her silent, sneaky and quick attitudes which makes her the perfect cat.

about DET. JAMES GORDON DET. JAMES GORDON is Good Cop. i like that character but i do not see any reason that why don't he shot that penguin............

about OSWALD COBBLEPOT i think he is gonna be the cruelest criminal ever, let's find out in next upcoming episodes

Overall the show is great i am loving it rather than other super hero series
