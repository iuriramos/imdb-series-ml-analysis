It just gets darker, meatier, and more convoluted! Fish Mooney has mis-matched eyes due to the evil Doctor! Bruce's lifetime fascination and love affair with "Cat" continues to flourish! Penguin is a natural born evil killer! Detective Gordon continues to play "Dudley Do-Right!" It just keeps getting better and better every week. Gotham is rotten to the core. Corrupt police and mob control. I almost "died" last week when Fish gouged out her own eyeball! Better than any Batman movie or series before it! Continues to act like a "cable" series as it pushes the censorship boundaries of broadcast TV almost every week! Very compelling! May run for years!
