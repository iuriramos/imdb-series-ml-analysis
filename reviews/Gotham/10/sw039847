But come on seriously a kind of prequel / backstory about Batman and Gotham??? We all know that...? Don't we...? No we don't.

And yes... The producers and the whole team behind it nailed it.

It's perfect, Ben Mc Kenzie is great as Det. James Gordon (and his 2014 Halloween costume proved it). He is the James Gordon that Gotham needs. But the one and only character that is more than perfect is Donal Logue's take on Bullock. He is the one, the link between Gotham and Batman, not Jim Gordon, we don't know Gordon's history, we never did, until now. But Bullock was always the rogue/bad temper cop/a*hole, he hated Batman since day 1 and now we understand why. And tonight I saw a bright light in Bullock, as in the comics and the recent "Injustice: God among us" comics.

He is the one who understands Gotham like no one else. He knows the true nature of it's inhabitants, he is one of them. An animal. He is the perfect blend between what a hero should be or not. Yes... An anti-hero... But with Bullock style... my favorite character until now, with the Penguin.

Anyway... Great show... Perfect cinematography, high values, and damn... Jada Pinkett is a milf.
