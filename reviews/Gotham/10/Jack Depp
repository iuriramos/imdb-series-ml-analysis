First of all i only gave it a 10 as as show of respect to Ben Mckenzie and to Batman, i think this is like some shows that start Okay but grow to be great, lets hope for it to be a huge success, i like the fact that they are showing Alfred treat Bruce tough, you know giving him a little bit of tough love, and i also like the fact that Bruce likes Heavy metal, its something we didn't know while watching the Batman Trilogy, the show shows many details in what Gotham is all about which is great but i don't want it to be like the CSI Gotham Version, i mean i don't want them to create new Criminals every episodes, let them stick with one for at least 2 episode, and cliffhangers are not that strong that makes you eager to watch the next episode, overall its an entertaining show that hopefully will get better in the future.
