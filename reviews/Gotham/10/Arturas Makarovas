This is my first review ,but hope not last one :) I actually enjoyed watching every single episode of Gotham. You must have in mind that i am not much a DC Universe lover,but this intense action TV show made me wait for every damn new episode coming on Mondays :) It is totally worth every single minute :) You will get action action action and always having in mind one single question "What will happen next ? ". This TV show full of surprises and budget surely pays off. The act of actors are just brilliant and you will see known characters the way you never even imagine it . You will love it as well for knowing origins of many characters from Batman series ,but even without storyline that goes around Batman you will fall in love with this dark action TV show :)
