Gotham! One of the best shows on TV! I'm not a big fan of DC or MARVEL comics, i just watch movies and shows, I'm old fashioned guy who likes comics from Europe like Zagor, Tex, Dylan Dog etc. This show is awesome great villains, great cast, amazing writing and i think that this show has the best Joker! Series start suspenseful from start to finish, every episode I'm on the edge of my seat, such a good storyline about James Gordon before Batman arrival. Show definitely gives a good vibe, its bloody its messy, full of amazing twists which everyone wants from the show, I'm telling you guys, start watching this show even if you are not the fan of DC or Batman you will like this show! Cheers
