I just watched the first three episodes of Gotham. And while I understand what some of the complaints are. Most of the people complaining about the show are missing the point. To understand Gotham you need to go back to the basics. And since this is a TV show they can't cram in 76 years of Batman history in one season. So they have to be creative. When bOb Kane and Bill Finger created Batman back in 1939 they envisioned a New York City except bigger. And nastier and more corrupt. Over the years Gotham city itself has become just as much of a character as Batman is. Frank Miller once wrote that to him Gotham city is darkness here there is no hope. Crime rules Crime is king. While Metropolis is light and there is hope in Gotham there is none. The Show is a perfect set up for The origin of Batman. While some of-the elements are missing from the comics such as IN Denny O'Neil's Origin story there is no hope in crime alley which shows us what happens after the shooting where Bruce meets Leslie Thompkins who helps raise Bruce alongside Alfred. here there is no Leslie. but there is now a relationship with Bruce and Jim Gordon and Alfred that is building into something special. the show has a L.A. Confidential feel to it . you can almost expect to see Bud White and Ed Exeley pop up. The only things that do distract. THe Actor portraying Harvey Bullock is turning into a walking clich√© the dirty street cop with a heart of gold who will beat a perp to get a confession. Bullock is a engaging enough character who should be written better. The Montoya and Allen team are just not needed. plus the characterizations of Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen are so far from what they are in the comics. They do not add anything as of yet of value to the show. Other then that the show is well written . Well acted . and almost brilliant in its Origin Story of Batman. I will watch this show with interest to see where it goes .
