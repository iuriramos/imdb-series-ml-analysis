I think that Gotham started off great. Most new TV series in the pilot either give away too much or they give too little, but this was just about right. It is well paced and very interesting, another thing I like about this TV show is the amount of action it contains, most TV shows of this era tend to lack action, it seems as if they are trying to stay away from action for some strange reason, but this isn't, so if youquiet like a action show, this is the one. Forget about the other shows which lack a lot and just drag. This comes on every Monday in the UK and I cant wait to watch the next episodes. Hopefully they can continue with the well paced and action packed story (because again other TV shows start off good but then go down hill).
