absolutely perfect in every way... Superb script, excellent casting and wonderful Gothic sets... This will end up being the best TV superhero show of all time. Bruno Heller does it again with a perfect TV series. 

Ignore the 7 year olds voicing their pubescent outrage at the lack of "Batman", this is no child's show... It's violent and brutally honest in its story telling. In this episode we meet the young Catwoman, penguin, Riddler and poison ivy to name a few. Jada is amazing and almost steels the show, but Ben McKenzie has too much charisma and screen presence to allow that to happen... Donal Logue keeps the show grounded with his human portrayal of a beat down and tired old school detective saddled with a noob. 

In time this will be the best show on TV. Ignore the imputant naysayers and jump on board for the ride of your life. It's an emotional roller coaster that tugs on your heart strings. 

Monday nights are officially GOTHAM nights!
