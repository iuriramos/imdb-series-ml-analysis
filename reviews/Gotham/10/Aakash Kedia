Right now its not a fantasy series, and if compared on the basis of that, will lead in its genre. Two things that you generally don't find in a TV series or movies these days together, is Cinematography and Screenplay. Now both of them are excellent here, with acting good enough not to complain. Its not a feel good series like flash or arrow, but goes in dark vibes of Gotham. They could show something with Bruce to make things interesting, but they are sticking to original Gotham timeline and trying not to affect development story of batman(respect for that). Its not repetitive like other series which are based on on single story . It looks to a situation from various perspective, both from good and but, with is admire.
