I loved this episode. Loved the way the relationship of Alfred and Bruce was depicted. I am kind of glad that this chapter didn't focus on Gordon and Bullock. I am trying to watch this series with an open mind. I honestly didn't believe that I will be able to adjust to a different story line from Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Not too satisfied with the Harvey Dent and Cat showed. The romance is not something which is a part of any storyline. At least in the teenage. The jump was kind of unnecessary. Overall, I give this episode 10/10 just because of Alfred and Bruce. Looking forward to the series. It's still early days. Love the twist of Gordon being sent to Asylum.
