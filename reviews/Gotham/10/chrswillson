I honestly don't think I could be any happier with how this show has started. I hadn't heard a whole lot about it until a week before it previewed, and I was immediately drawn in. I love super heroes(both universes), and was thrilled at the idea. I can't believe how well the set of the show is done. It looks EXACTLY like i pictured Gotham would. After only 3 episodes there are already so many familiar faces we are introduced to. This show has SO much potential and I have high hopes that it will only continue to impress me. This is by far my favourite new show this year, and already in my top 5 altogether.

Now the only thing i am concerned about is whether or not it will be cancelled. FOX has renewed all the shows I enjoy so far(the following/new girl) so PLEASE DON'T CANCEL GOTHAM! I gave this a 10/10 after seeing 4 episodes and loving every one of them.
