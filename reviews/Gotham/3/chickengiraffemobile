Good looking war hero with superior intellect and morals of a monk will stare into the eyes of organized crime and corruption. No matter what, he will always do the right thing while being wildly unappreciated during his heroics. He is a son of the best District Attorney that Gotham has ever seen, who was killed in a tragic car accident just in front of his kid. He (and everyone else) can make definitive and life changing conclusions with the least bit of information from an unreliable source.

I wish i was exaggerating but this is as far as the pilot goes. That and an evil villain with yellow teeth and a crazy laugh while he tortures people
