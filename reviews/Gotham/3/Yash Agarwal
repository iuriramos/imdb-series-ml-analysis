With each episode the level should increase like Shield, It was bad from season 1 and it was improved a lot since then.

Unlike all the DC shows, they are just showing something not relevant, cause they know that this ain't included in the big league.

Marvel's Netflix shows are going crazy good even though they won't be included in the movies.

Agent carter was good and Shield is improving a lot, unlike DC TV becoming worse each time.

I guess DC was better in the comics but not in the movies and TV, here Marvel rules.
