Why did the thief kill Wayne family even he got what he asked for?

When did Gordon assigned to the Gotham police department, what is it in his background make him war hero or a special one? 

Why the guy ran away from home and got himself killed when the police said they want to search his home? His wife said he will never kill a man then why did he try to kill a policeman? 

Why did Penguin killed the innocent man? Is it because he is psychopath? How about the young version of catwoman, why is she everywhere? Is she mentally ill and trying to be a camera?

Or maybe as batman fans we should reduce our expectations. Pilot episode was not promising for me. I hope I am wrong.
