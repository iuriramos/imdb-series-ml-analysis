You might as well watch any other police drama similar in nature to "The Shield" or "Criminal Minds". The writers fall upon Detective James Gordon meeting four of Gotham's future crime bosses in just one episode. In a city of millions, that is like winning the state lottery six times in a row. 

Let's face it, the early teen years of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City is like watching the early years of Pompeii or a series called "The Building of the Titanic". This is just pointless and you shouldn't be seeing a young Bruce Wayne jumping into action.

I understand the focus is on James Gordon as a rookie detective, but again, he is not about to put on a mask and fight crime. It is only made worse when you realize, no matter what peril becomes him, he must always escape danger. That kind of character is dull and lifeless.

I know there are fans who will watch and cheer this show just because it is related in name only to the franchise. I ask you, please, take a step outside the box. View the pilot and episode two once more. This time without preconceived characters in any nameless city. Now ask yourself, if this show is any different from the countless other crime dramas offered?
