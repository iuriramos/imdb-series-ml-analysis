Judging by the reviews, one either loves this series or they hate it. I stand under the latter. I sort of hope that the League of Shadows/Assassins come into play at some point, because I'd like to see anyone try to argue, like Bruce did in Batman Begins, that there are good people in the city who are worth saving. Right now the worst criminal element in Gotham are the cops. How seriously are we to take the crime here? It makes sense that someone would try to do something about all the corruption on their own. But the fact that we're already witnessing a Gotham so bloodthirsty for justice that the people will idolize a guy who outright murders people in horrifying ways sort of paints a rather nasty picture of the normal citizenry too. The more and more Gotham is shown as a cesspool from every perceivable angle, the harder it is to care about anything or anyone. Why would a normal good person want to live in Gotham? Wouldn't it be easier to pack your bags and move down south? I live in Florida. The sun shines here. There's fun in Florida. Not so in Gotham. Gotham is not a fun city. Maybe it's time for little Bruce to take his10 year Sabbatical and leave the city right now. That would make me happy. So, outside of Gordon, who is worth saving on this show? Maybe Harvey Dent will tell us in the next episode. To be continued ... By the way, is it fair for spam, like the one below me with the header, "Awesome Game," to rank TV shows? Is this how the game is played, balanced and misrepresented? Gee, this sight needs better security.
