I went into Gotham expecting what I knew it would be. Nothing like The Dark Knight, but a crime drama based in the area of Gotham. I gave it a shot, I honestly did. The acting is pretty good and the writing is passable. But the execution is what makes this show what it is. Disappointing. I was really hyped for this show, and was let down by the terrible execution made by Fox. The show is choppy. It seems like it doesn't know where it's trying to go. And, along with that, the show is just flat out uninteresting. You don't care about anything that happens to the characters, because they are not explained. Why? Because Fox relies on the fact that they'r Batman characters. If they were not DC characters, you wouldn't care any less. Along with that, the show obviously tries way too hard to throw in little Batman easter eggs. Even if they don't make sense, or go against the source material. Pam Isley's name is Pam Isley. NOT Ivy. Selina Kyle, or Catwoman, never went by the name "Cat". Bruce Wayne did not "test himself" once his parents died. The show's actions against the source material alone is enough to make this show not very good. And when you add annoyance within it, that just makes it worse. Cobblepot's casting was really well done, and is honestly the only reason this show got a 3/10 from me. Anything else is not worth watching. Do not trust the reviews. This is not a must see. If anything? This is a must miss.
