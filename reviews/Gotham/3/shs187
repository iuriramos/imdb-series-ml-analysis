I'll start off by saying that I am huge comic fan and was very much looking forward to this show. However, after seeing it I have to admit that it just doesn't deliver. It basically takes the awesome world of Batman and turns it into a mediocre police show. What is the point of a show that takes the supporting cast of the comic world and makes them the central theme. Also it screws up the time line. In the future when Batman is at his prime I guess he is fighting a 60 something Penguin? The whole deal with Catwoman being his childhood pal is ridiculous as well. They're trying to change the history of Batman so that there is filler material for this boring show.
