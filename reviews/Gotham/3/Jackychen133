Many things just ain't right about this, but my attention goes to the penguin mostly. I know going your own way could be a good thing, but come on! At least do a little to keep things original or don't make it related to the batman series at all. The penguin should be a chubby guy with hat and stuff, this guy here is the total opposite. Some slim guy with a tramp like hair (and obviously too much gel) and a face like he's suffering from Ebola. That's just not how a penguin looks like. You could remove the hat, but it must at least resemble his name! Selina Kyle is one of the ugliest version of it I have ever seen and the acting is so shabby. If this director paid a lot for this I would definitely ask his money back, what a waste and shame for something that could be so great.
