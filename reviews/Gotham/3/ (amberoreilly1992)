My biggest gripe with this show is that the production value isn't great. The special effects and the production value should be much better on this show considering the BUILT IN fan base that this show already had before it even aired. Terrible production value can make a good script terrible. There really is NO EXCUSE as to why this show can't do things better. Did the network honestly say "Wow, the Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises made heaps of money in the box office, I guess we already have the fans so we don't have to put any effort into this". And that beginning of the first episode where it followed that girl (Who'll probably end up being cat woman considering they hired captain obvious to write the script)was so stupidly pointless and it gave me a real look into how terrible the special effects are.

This show is probably another Doctor Who. People will defend the awful script and abhorrent special effects because it's a silly little fan base. There really is no excuse in this day and age for such carelessness to the production.
