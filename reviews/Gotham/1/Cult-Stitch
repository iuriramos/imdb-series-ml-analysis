You can't judge a book by its cover but you can certainly judge a series by its pilot, especially when it has to throw in the lowest common denominator viewer expectations in 45 minutes. This is being touted as batman without batman, or a police drama taking place in batman's world etc. this is fanboy stuff, you are either already loving it or hating it based on your own expectations. The acting is decent and the casting is good, but when you are already teased five of batman's most important villains, possibly six if you count the possible stand up comedian as a potential teaser (all within 45 minutes of the pilot), well at least for me my patience already is lost. This is a ham-fisted way to get started, pandering to both the drooling fanboys and the casual viewer that heard this is about batman. This could have been a nice addition, but "finesse" is a rarity on the big networks. If you are already buying this crap, there is nothing more i could say.
