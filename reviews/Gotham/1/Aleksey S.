In the world of Gotham, Batman is a useless child with angst problems.

He's a tertiary character stuck in a dull, dreary, low-budget police procedural.

The two leads, recently seen in Southland and Sons Of Anarchy, play it completely deadpan, and their talents are completely wasted. The bad acting isn't limited to them, however.

It is a disease that originates from the childish lines, which could be taken directly from a George Lucas film, and it infected every single character in the show.

As for the visuals, they look like a generic gray city. Most of the sets are a person in an apartment, sewer, garage, etc.

So, if you like seeing recognizable actors read terrible exposition off teleprompter while standing against a gray wall, you're gonna love this show.
