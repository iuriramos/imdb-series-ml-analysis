Gotham started off with promise, but it never really improved and I didn't even bother finishing off the season because it became too much of a sh*t show. The biggest problem with Gotham is that they can't go one episode without making some sort of Batman reference, and making it so obvious that it's like they're practically saying, "Hey love us we're a Batman show without Batman." it's stupid. The second problem is that this show tries to have these dark undertones and themes, trying to be gritty like The Dark Knight, but the writing is so bad that it feels like I'm watching Batman and Robin. The production is great, but unfortunately that's the only redeeming factor.
