When I heard they would be doing a series about Gotham city, I thought this would be a fantastic show. A serious, crime drama and a realistic take on the Batman universe. But instead, what we get is this cheesy, cartoonish slaptick junk that lacks any kind of suspense or subtly. Within the first few seconds of the Penguin being on the screen somebody says "Ya know, you look like a penguin." Within the first few seconds of the Riddler being on the screen, somebody says "Enough with the riddles." And Selina Kyle goes by the name "Kat." I mean...COME ON! This show lacks any intelligence in the writing. The acting is also dreadful. It reminds me of the old Adam West show. I'm just waiting for somebody to say "Get'em boys!" I SO wanted to like this show but it's really awful.
