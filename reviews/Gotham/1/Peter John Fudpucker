Season one of this series recently became available on Netflix. I decided to sit down and see what makes a great series without the Bat. I figured it would be a lot more focused on Gordon vs the mafia crime families. I thought from the user rating it would be worth watching. Oh boy was I ever wrong.

The series is in trouble for sure when you are half way in the first season, and Gordon is still paying visits to Bruce Wayne. He keeps talking to a boy, as if he were an adult or superior officer. There was no need to keep this character in the series this long. Bruce Wayne and Alfred should be in Europe or Bruce at school. Why is this kid still living in the crime ridden city of Gotham and not at a private school?

Next the series name-drops bad guys like a politician at a party. It is bad enough I have to see flashes of kid Batman but Catwoman as a little girl? Really? The sad news is the name-dropping doesn't stop there. Just in the first few episodes you get introduce to more bad guys that should be Bruce Wayne's age but instead are much older adults. 

Instead of focusing in on crime families and Gordon, this season seems to focus on Oswald "Penguin" Cobblepot. So much in fact, the series should be called the "Penguin: Rise to Power". I took slightly more interest in his character than anyone else. The show isn't even suppose to be centered on him. This is bad as watching Steve Urkel taking over the show "Family Matters".

This series could have been great but it is not. I realize I cannot place my faith in the IMDb user ratings. This is not a great crime drama. This is just someone's bad retelling and profiting from the Batman franchise. I gave it a shot and this is my opinion.

People who enjoy and like this garbage series belong in Arkham Asylum.
