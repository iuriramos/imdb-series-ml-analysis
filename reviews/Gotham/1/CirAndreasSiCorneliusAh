Seriously? Gordon is being dragged to what he has to know is his death, yet when he wakes up, he yells to the guy, instead of waiting for the opportunity to catch him off guard. Is he supposed to be a total moron? How many times are they going to have someone turn their back on an enemy so he can bash them over the head? Aren't we tired of being subjected to the so called hero, heroically letting the scumbag go, so he can kill as many innocents as possible? How about putting a little effort into the writing, directing and presentation of a program to support the excellent acting and special effects most programs have now. How about the characters that are supposed to be experienced professionals behave like it, and if certain outcomes are desired, develop a storyline that actually supports it, instead of taking the lazy path, of having your characters act like idiots, or immature, compulsive preteens.
