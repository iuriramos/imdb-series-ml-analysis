When a person, who does not quite understand human behavior, writes a story (about humans) it is bound be terrible. This show will feature some of the most unnatural dialogue like, people who know each other will often announce their names without there being a cause to. You will also see a man trying to convince a boy to keep his chin up moments after the boy's parents have been murdered. Note that this man is supposed to be the one who takes care of the boy. And let's not forget the murderer who just happened to feel like shooting two people, for no apparent reason, and then letting their child live, for no apparent reason also. I won't complain about the acting, because they have good actors. It's only that they have to play badly written characters.

This series lacks depth; it will not offer you any. I've read a lot of Batman comic books as a teenager, and it would be safe to say that I've invested enough time in Batman material (from the '60s classic series to the WB animations to all the Batman movies ever made) to have a say on this matter.
