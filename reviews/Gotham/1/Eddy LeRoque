The film Noir idea has got to go. Just because a techie can computer generate a dark sky doesn't mean the head writer needs to use it in every scene.

Regrettably computer graphics are used when writing fails. The weather balloon idea was just plain useless. 

Endless homicides, with a tip of the hat to gamers everywhere. Perhaps that is the market segment Heller is aiming at.

One murder after another with Oswald Cobblepot killing people for sandwiches and shoes. Yet "the penguin" remains rational. 

maybe we will get lucky and Fox will bring in a new header writer.
