I could go on and on about the horrible acting or the terrible scripts, I could also mention how nothing makes sense or how pretty much every character that has ever set a foot in Gotham shows up as a weird parody of himself/herself.

But instead I am going to mention the only decent part of this show which is the environment which is pretty okay. The alleys, the dark feel, the constant raining and most sets are good and actually give a decent feel for Gotham as a place.

Everything else is awful. If you think BvS was bad, this is worse.

How anyone can watch this is beyond me. I've agonizingly sat through most episodes and I would rather get Sunburn Itch then watch a single minute more. Horrible, awful, terrible and lots of other words I cannot use here. That people take time from their lives to give this show high ratings (currently on 8!) can only mean that there is an asylum missing patients.
