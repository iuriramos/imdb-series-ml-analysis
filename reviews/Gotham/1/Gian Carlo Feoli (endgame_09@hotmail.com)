First of all I am a BIG batman fan, its films, animated series and video games.

Just watched Gotham, really disappointed, really bad, bad lines, clichés everywhere, and the "actress" playing character of Barabara Gordon shows a really bad acting, just a hot blond acting really bad, and whats the point of the gay thing with her? looked cheap and stupid. The episode was really boring, and I don't see the point of introducing all those characters by name immediately almost saying their names while looking to the camera so EVERYONE has to know who they are the moment they show up, sometimes looked like a sitcom.

The only 2 characters that didn't sink as clichéd, stupid or lame where Bruce Wayne and Gordon, even Alfred looked out of place, maybe because he had like a military feeling all the episode, the way he walks, stand and speak, didn't felt at all like Alfred but some soldier, oh and when Ed told that stupid, STUPID riddle to the police referring to the bullet, , sounded forced and bad acted, and the actress playing Barbara, did I mentioned her bad acting yet? really hot, but lame as heck.
