Take one of the most popular icons in the comic industry, one that people are hungry to see in any form of media, and then make a series where you get everything that is a part of the batman universe ... EXCEPT Batman. 

I couldn't watch the entire first episode before I had to turn it off. By the time Bruce Wayne is old enough to become Batman, the villains they're introducing will be wearing diapers and watching reruns of "Murder She Wrote" in the old folks home. 

What a waste. If you want to really give the audience what they want, take a long look at Arrow and Flash to see how it's done, boys.
