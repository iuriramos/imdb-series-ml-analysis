Gotham is a TV show that literally proves that people have hypocritical views on films and television based on comic books. The series has poorly written script and bad casting choices reminiscent of Joel Schumacher's Batman movies. Ben McKenzie could be a perfect Batman in a Batman show as he slightly resembles Bruce Wayne in Batman Year One, not to forget he voiced Batman in the animated film. Him being cast as Jim Gordon is like the casting of Jim Carrey as Riddler in Batman Forever as this Riddler behaved more like the Joker. Casting of Robin Lord Taylor as Penguin is another bad casting choice as his physical appearance matches the Joker more than Penguin, as Penguin is obese and short in the comics, not tall and well-built. He even does not share the Penguin's exact origin story. Penguin started off as a thief trying to restore his family name. He becomes a crime boss and opens a nightclub called the Iceberg Lounge. This one is dogsbody to a totally unlikable character named Fish Mooney and does nothing more than kill and poison people. This Penguin is like Deadpool in X-Men Origins Wolverine because they share nothing in common except the name. The series even mixed up the murder of Batman's parents with that of the Helena Bertinelli Huntress's. In here, the Wayne murders are planned, not random violence like in the comics. Almost every character is older than Batman, making it bad. The show is more like a prequel to the sh*** Beware the Batman, because in that animated series, there are barely any proper villains. I can't believe critics think this show is better than Batman v Superman.
