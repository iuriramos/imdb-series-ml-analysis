Having a Batman show without Batman was already a bad premise to start with, but even as cynical as I was I didn't think it was going to be this bad.

(What follows is full of Spoilers)

The show starts with a teen Catwoman witnessing the Wayne's murders, then we move on to see the heroes of the show Jim Gordon and Harvey Bullock (who cannot win since Gotham needs Batman).

If you could bare that, then you're introduced to pre-costumed versions of Penguin as an ambitious low life criminal, Edward Nigma as a consultant for GCPD, a child Ivy Pepper (how original!), and what seems to hint of The Joker in the making.

On the golden age of comic book TV shows, this was completely abominable, a waste of an hour, probably one of the worst adaptations of the Batman mithos I have ever seen.

Stay away from it, I know I will.
