In the opening, the police refuse to give a sick man his medicine. They refuse, and then react with excessive force when he takes matters into his own hands. (Why are they surprised? They CREATED the situation.) He doesn't threaten anyone, he just asks for his medicine. Young Gordon steps in, lies to him, gives him aspirin, long enough to distract him while other cops gang up on him and start beating the snot of him.

Gordon is heralded for it. Really, writers? Shame on you! Your ignorance knows no bounds. Police using excessive force is a very real issue. Cops beating up sick people is all too common. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I am disgusted.

The rest of the show was mediocre at best. I won't be wasting my time again.
