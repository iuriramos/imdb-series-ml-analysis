Its amazing to me that there is such a lack of talented writers in TV land. The scripts and story lines are predictable and tired. The characters, stupid and boring. The acting is...at best, childish and from the beginners school of acting? Can't believe that adults watch this nonsense. Its not fun. Its not interesting. Its not slightly original in any way. Marvel is doing much better with Agent Carter. This show is a looser. What it is, it is a great waste of time, money and intelligence. Also, I have to ask...why does a review need a minimum of 10 lines? Some shows just need one. Its pretty small thinking of IMDb to require this. Guess they are just like the TV shows they review...need a lot of sentences to describe crap?
