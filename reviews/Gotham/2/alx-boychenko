I'm always skeptical about superhero movies. They are bound to be childish and one-dimensional, with rare exceptions like "The Watchmen". Of course, now we're talking about TV-series, where expectations are lower and budget is thinner. Comics are for immature, retarded or kids, but you can actually feed some of this to oldies with strong sense of nostalgia, when villain names like "Penguin" are heard. Anyway, please pay attention to grieving Bruce in a scene, where his parents are murdered. Camera sliding off, leaving kneeing Bruce, his back turned to bodies, facing camera, thinking he's performing a freaking phantom of the opera part. What a phoney piece of cinematography. Far away from Nolan's vector in dealing with comic adaptations and I bet the whole series is going to be just like that - witless plastic aggregation of comic clich√©s, annoying women, stupid dialogs and plot holes (mind my words - Gordon's girlfriend will turn to be a puke-conjuring disaster)

Kids under 14 and McDonald-loving low-life hillbillies would enjoy it though.DO NOT believe those marking this show as "smartly written". It may seem this way for comic and pop culture zealots though, but please, do not insult those reading REAL BOOKS.
