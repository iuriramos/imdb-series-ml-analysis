I was expecting more about Gotham.

I was expecting that: 1) the city will play a bigger role in this TV show: to me, not really. 2) characters will be properly introduced during the whole season - here you feel that the screenwriters tried to put as many as characters as possible 3) you will care more for the lead character (James Gordon). He is too transparent. And his introductory scene at the police station is really ridiculous

I dislike: 1) the plot of this episode 2) ALL the characters - Fish Money less than the others 3) the approach taken to introduce so many characters in 1 single episode

Did the last scene of the 1st episode ends such a way that I want to see more ? Not really.
