Is it only me who is missing how bad this show is! Terrible acting, predictable, terrible storyline and the most frustrating... People who don't read Batman comics or know Batman well, might watch this show and think badly of Batman. They have changed the Origin stories of most characters for the worse. They have also tied in way too many characters. Some of the cameos in this show are painful to watch especially the Poison Ivy cameo. As well as this they have ruined Victor Zass and Bruce Wayne and don't forget Alfred hes supposed to be Posh not Cockney! OH and Catwomen and the Penguin. Why is the Penquin American and why does he look 25 years old when he should be in his 50s or 40s. This show just makes two many errors. I can only say one good thing about the show... Some of the stories can be entertaining. This show overall and reasonably deserves a 6.5/10.
