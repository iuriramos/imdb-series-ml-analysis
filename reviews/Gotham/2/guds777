I am sadly disappointed, i was like a little kid on a Christmas all last week waiting for this show, but what a horrendous fail. What is Bruno Heller thinking. I know this is just a pilot, and things can change, but with this setup not a chance. Everything about this is so clumsy and cheap, i am deeply hurt, i am offended by this. The acting is clumsy and just bad, the dialog is just dry and ugly, the storyline was not right, things just happen without any background and so many wrong actors in so many wrong roles, biggest mistakes were Alfred and Mr Wayne, i am not judging the actors Per se , but chose of actors for those roles and many others. Maybe this is just ruff idea of what may happen, but it needs serious refining, new casting and maybe some acting classes, it needs some class, that ,,real,, touch, something for us to admire, fall in love with and get hooked. This is not that...
