It's dark, it's well-developed, and the writing is really good. I was quite surprised when I first watched Gotham when it premiered. I had seen the pilot twice and every episode after that once. The show as a whole, is really enjoyable and good to watch. Its dark tone and crime theme makes it great - and I like most characters in the show. I particularly like those portrayed by Ben McKenzie, Robin Taylor, Sean Pertwee and Donal Logue. A strong show in terms of depth, character development, tone, theme and writing. The darker the better - because it's dark DC Comics tone is awesome! There wasn't an episode I disliked, all were pretty damn great.
