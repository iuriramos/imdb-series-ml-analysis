Of late, I have realized that TV content is getting developed much better than movies and I find myself binge-watching many recent TV series than movies. This is happening all the more because of the gripping and taut story lines (TV shows, given their length, used to ramble on about the plot, but thankfully no more) and brilliant overall delivery. 

Gotham stands out even amongst this new wave of brilliant TV shows. The first season of Gotham exuded brilliance. Tight direction, brilliant (overkilling this word no?) acting, fantastic casting and this amalgamation is truly one for the ages. Every cast member seems to be perfect for their role and they deliver and how!! 

Without giving much away, Jada Pinkett Smith, you ma'am are as much of a powerhouse performer as your famous husband! What a performance by her! Every scene she is in, she totally steals the show. Robin Lord Taylor is mesmerizing in his role of Oswald Cobblepot. I found the entire cast to be perfect and the above two were mentioned for no particular reason but for their sheer brilliance on screen. 

As a fellow reviewer, I too thought another 'Batman Begins' won't be much fun but I did expect some detailing seeing this is a TV show. But was I blown away! This was more of a Jim Gordon Begins or more correctly, Ascends kinda story. This storyline works perfect for this show as gradually the different villains are introduced in their own chilling manner (and man, the violence and mafia story lines are a delight) and gradually build up to why Gotham would end up needing a masked (and caped) crusader! Anyway, that's where I hope the future seasons are going. A lot to look forward to in Season 2 of Gotham and boy it sure looks promising!
