If you have never picked up a Batman comic or movie or cartoon or game, you'll still love this show. Don't go into this show expecting a "batman show" because its not. It has a very good tone, good writing and great character development, I would say this is the best DC comics show out there right now. Of course there is space for improvement but its a very well done show with good and interesting story lines for the characters but the best part about the show is that it is an amazing show period and doesn't need to be branded as a "super hero show" because its that good. The season 1 pilot was very good in my opinion introducing new characters and familiar comic book characters but setting up a very good story for each character. Mid season 1 was a little slow but the finale made up for it in my opinion. Season 2 is where the show got really good and there is huge revelations and plot twists due to the events of season 1. So I would strongly recommend you watch this show. I give it a B +
