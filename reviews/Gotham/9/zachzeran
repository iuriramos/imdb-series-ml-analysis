I have seen a lot of mixed reactions regarding the show Gotham. And one of the primary complaints on the negative side of things is that it is not like the comics or something...

I love Gotham because I am a fan of the batman series but i'm not totally invested in every single plot-line and character, so if the show decides to mix things up then I can go along with it. The characters in this show are likable and brilliantly portrayed, Ben McKenzie is a great actor and a great choice to be playing commissioner Gordon. I was most surprised with Robin Lord Taylor's portrayal of Oswald Cobblepot, as far as I can tell the comics version of the characters is just some overweight crime lord, it is funny how everyone can go from not really caring about a character like the penguin until a great actor like Robin Taylor comes around and portrays the character brilliantly. The rest of the cast is great as well and i found that there were no weak links in this pretty large cast of characters.

The story-line of season 1 was very mobster like and I'm not really a big fan of mobster movies and shows but this one I just found myself wanting more of. I was happy to see the mob story begging to disappear by the end of the season 1 and we got great episodes like the one with the red hood and the ogre. Season 2 took the show to a new level of great and is a lot more improved from the already great season 1. 

The show has interesting story-lines that are sure to grab your attention and great characters that are brilliantly portrayed by there said actors. I recommend this show to everyone, besides the really picky batman fans.
