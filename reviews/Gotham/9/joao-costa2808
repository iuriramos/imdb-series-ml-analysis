The day i started watching Gotham i just thought, "well its the beginning and the past of batman, this way i can the story of Bruce Wayne, Jim Gordon, Oswald Cobelpot, the Joker, etc" but now if someone asks me if i follow "that batman series" i just don't associate. This is no longer a story of a hero and he's foes, this has turned into an amazing and well established crime series, it just keeps surprising me, Robin Taylor (penguin) is just an amazing actor, sorry brilliant, he took penguin out of the books and gave him life, the mad and yet criminal mastermind he is. Cory Smith (ridler) is doing an awesome job acting as Edward Nygma, he is smart and psychologically damaged. Gotham is currently the best comic based TV series, as dark as frank miller turned the city. I just can stop watching. And as a comic lover i just have to say "well done" and clap.
