I've been watching this series from the beginning and it's easily the best new show out there for 2014-2015. The writing is excellent and the cinematography is movie quality. While the story does explore the early beginnings of Bruce Wayne becoming The Batman, it's more about the formation of the other heroes and villains that make up Gotham. With each episode, the story only gets better and better. I thought I wasn't going to like it as much as I do, because there's no Caped Crusader, but the action is plentiful and the directing and acting are excellent, especially Sean Pertwee as Alfred and Robin Lord Taylor as Oswald Cobbelpot. Don't let the early reviews that were negative fool you, I think those folks either didn't give it a chance, or they were looking for Batmoblies and and capes. You get to see the development of the not just The Peguin, The Riddler, and at the time of this writing, The Joker, but of many other characters in the Batman universe. It's quite fascinating!
