One of my current favorite TV-shows. Mostly amazing acting, well- written action and makes you want more after each episode. Only character I've really disliked so far is the one played by Jada Pinkett Smith. 

Season 1 was still great and all season 2 episodes I've seen have been better and better. Michael Chiklis finally shows he can still act incredibly well (I'm a huge The Shield-fan) and I just can't wait to see the rest of the season.

So, the show is well-written, well-acted and well-directed - and really entertaining! The quality is simply top-notch. The show makes you feel like you are in Gotham watching the action live. Not too many shows can make that happen, or at least I haven't seen that happening.
