Great actors, great writing and just a wonderful show so far. 

Had to do a double take on Donal Logue after his role in Vikings, in Gotham he is just great and his character is pretty rough and tumble and funny...had no idea Donal was such a versatile actor. 

Ben McKenzie (perennial RomCom pretty boy) is very good as well. At times he is basically the straight man in the comedy duo of the Donal and Ben characters. He does a very good job at being the straight shooter honest cop in his role and the comedic offset to Donal's character every so often, I do not think that easy to do. Also, I think he doubles as the Alfred character for young Bruce Wayne...well done indeed by this actor.

And Robin Lord Taylor as the future Penguin is excellent! 

There are some very well known TV actors that appear in the show and the moodiness of Gotham is captured so very well in the show - better I think than past Batman movies. 

Keep the episodes coming, this is a great show so far.
