The first season of Gotham, a foreshadowing of Bruce Wayne's early years and Detective James Gordon's rise in the corrupt Gotham City Police Department is an intense telling which succeeds for the most part from beginning to end. The telling of James Gordon's rise to the rank of Commissioner was very well done and the character was portrayed quite absolute, as well as Bruce Wayne's story on the rise to being Batman. The series succeeded with character chemistry and action sequences, while also making good runtime per episode.

However, there were some flaws to the first season. Firstly, the villains. The origin stories of the Penguin and newcomer Fish Mooney were executed flawlessly (even the tease of a possible Joker thrilled audiences alike), but then there were some others like the one evil-doer who... kills people by sending them above via balloons? What? Secondly, I wasn't a big fan on the subplot with Barbara Kean, the former love interest of Gordon - & the final bit with her being revealed a villain felt like the directors were making it up as they went along. However, Gordon's secondary love interest who was introduced halfway during the season made up for it.

Pros: Flawless Execution on retelling of James Gordon, Flawless Execution on retelling of Bruce Wayne, Action-Packed, Penguin & Fish Mooney, Joker Tease, Character Chemistry, Exceptional Runtime

Cons: Barbara Kean subplot, Idiotic sub-villains

Overall, this achieves a 9 star rating. Gotham amazes in a surprising stellar fashion and despite a few flaws, it passes in my book and I would be looking forward to the second season.
