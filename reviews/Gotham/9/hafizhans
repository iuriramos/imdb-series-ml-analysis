Watching the second episode just now. I am staring to like the show. its really shows how desperate Gotham needs Batman and right now only Gordon seems like a truly good guy. the most exciting things that i like so far are the bad guy character. all carried out their character very good. especially the penguin. i also love how Gordon and his colleague done their work, kinda like good cop bad cop routine. i am surprised to see Alfred in hot tempered mode cause i always pictured him as obedient-patience servant. so keep up the good work, Gotham! looking forward to see how Bruce ended up to become a superhero in the end.
