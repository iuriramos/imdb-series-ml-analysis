I'm a huge fan of Batman, and as such I totally relate to Gotham City (I'm actually playing the Arkham City game, which adds to my personal fun in terms of Batman cities). And Gotham City is the perfect set for a show like this: You know the future Batman villains, you know there's corruption in Gotham and it's going to hell, you know Jim Gordon, and some pay attention to the Architectural city itself. I do, and I think it is a show that can go very far and well, if the writers treat well all there is to explore. I just finished the 1st episode and gotta say BRAVO! If they explore this well, you don't have to have Batman for this to succeed.
