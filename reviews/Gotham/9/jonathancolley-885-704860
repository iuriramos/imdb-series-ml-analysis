I can't believe the negative reviews this show is getting despite only airing a couple of episodes?

Sure there are some aspects of the story line which are getting hurried along a bit but for my money the show is about Jim Gordon and his growing relationship with a tortured kid Bruce Wayne and how a relationship of trust grows to the point that one day Bruce trusts Gordon to the point of being his only liaison within Gotham PD and the rise of Gordon to Police Commissioner.

Asking why things are happening so early on in the show reminds me of watching a film with the kids "but why did the bad man steal the gold?", "but why is the monster trying to eat that little boy?", "but why..." JUST WATCH AND FIND OUT!!!! LOL

I have no problems with the acting, it's fine, not award winning (watch this space lol) but good enough to not ruin my entertainment.

Lets be realistic, the main appeal of this show is going to be that it's a Batman tie-in so the majority of people watching will have a reasonable idea of what is going on and just get off on the idea of recognising names and crimes linked to them.

This is a very watchable show, my only bug bear is Alfred. Now I think Sean Pertwee is a fine actor but being a bit old skool I like the idea of Alfred being posh and kinda refined (Aka. an English Butler) whereas this version is a little too rough around the edges but then that's maybe due to the fact you only really see him around Bruce and he is treating him more like a child/young man which is why he can be a bit... Snappy(?).

On the whole, I have high hopes.
