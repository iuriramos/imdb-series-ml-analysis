Growing up I personally wasn't much of a Batman fan, but discovered that I tended to watch the movies purely for the fact that it contained some of the most fascinating villains. The completely psycho and twisted villains were far more entertaining for me to watch than the actual Batman himself; they're all so messed up and quirky for example Penguin looks, walks, dresses, eats and acts like a Penguin yet hates it when people refer to him as being one.

This TV show is perfect for people like me because the villains are central to the plot rather than the Batman, so if you are a bit on the dark side and enjoy learning more about the psychotic villains of Gotham then this show is the one for you!
