It is always difficult to get viewers attention from a superhero spin-off which doesn't include any superheroes.

Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D did this in 8-9 episodes and got us hooked. However Gotham surprises pleasantly.

Strongest point of the show must be its cinematography. Amazing scenes showing how Gotham really is. This is a big plus for the non comic readers since eventually it is always about Gotham. Clever writing also impresses. It is actually one of the things I loved. So many T.V shows and even most movies now has that unnecessary character(s) whose only job is to state the obvious. Gotham actually respects the audience and let you think for a little. I think it is really difficult to pull it out in such a major production.

Weak points may include the side - characters which may or may not become an issue later on. Villains so far are not interesting enough. Apart from the main guy, there is no one you would like / root for. However, we should be reminded that this is Gotham where there are no good guys.
