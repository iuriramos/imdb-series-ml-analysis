Since the day that "Gotham" was announced, it seemed such a strange move. Yet after seeing the pilot,I am down to follow each episode that comes in the following weeks. 

Characters are well written and acted with the strong cast that this show holds while so far storytelling is pretty decent. There are cameos of particular villains of Batman that will probably have a big impact on the show in future episodes. 

Yet the pilot had some things that the show needs to improve on. Some scenes were a bit rushed so I wish to see the show to improve its pacing a little more.

Overall, Gotham shows promise to be one of the greatest shows ever aired in television yet it seems there still walking on their baby steps. Rating: 8.7/10 but since there is no decimal rating I'm alright to walk away with a nine.
