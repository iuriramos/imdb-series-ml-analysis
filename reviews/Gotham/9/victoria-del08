I must say, the show is phenomenal! I gave it a nine because some of the scenes and characters are a little over dramatic for my opinion; however the story line is great. I love the idea of back stories; I am not a comic book fan, so please, don't place me on that list... 

Gotham has incredible moments. I fell in love with Batman whilst playing the game "Arkham Asylum" for PS3 and why I fell in love with it, was because of all the back stories. 

So as soon as I saw the trailer for this I found it on my DVR and recorded the series. The idea of a back story television show for one of the most amazing comic books out there was an intriguing idea. That was the best part of the game!! I was so pleased with the pilot episode, I long for the next one and can hardly wait. The acting is phenomenal, and the person who plays "Penguin" brings a completely different idea to the character. You don't know what is going to happen, you don't know whose side he is on, and come on what about Fish Mooney!! Great addition. 

The plot in this show is amazing, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and you honestly can't figure out what is going to happen! I keep asking myself is this going to be this character, or that character. It is a fun sort of investigation and you don't know who is going to be what. 

*****SPOILER ALERT*****

I thought that the episode with the Venom was totally going to be Bane, a beloved Batman villain, but sure enough it was a sultry psychiatrist. Like I said, I cant guess who or what is going to happen and that is completely different from every television show on air today. 

I love this show and am so looking forward to watching how the villains we know and love are going to start there crazy crime driven ways. Great show FOX absolutely love it keep it coming!!!
