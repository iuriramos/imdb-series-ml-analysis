This is already destined to be a GREAT series as it is suitable for people of all ages (mostly 12 and up though due to violence). The First season so far is showing us all the corruption and violence in the streets of Gotham, as well as the lead up to the transition of Bruce Wayne as a child, to BATMAN!

As we get to see in the first episode, Detective Jim Gordan is going to play a big role in the storyline. He is tasked to find and arrest the murderer of Bruce Wayne's parents, although along the way, gets caught up in his own business with Falcone and Marone.

In conclusion, I'm definitely watch this series through to the end. It explains why Bruce becomes Batman, and how the corruption in Gotham is what drives Batman to fight crime in the near future.
