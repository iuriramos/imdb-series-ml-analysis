At first I was skeptical. I've always been a big Batman fan since I could remember, and when I heard that the show didn't reflect the original story very well, I was really upset. Later down the road I said, "Screw it. It's Batman. Can't be that bad." And when I read in the credits Bruno Heller had a hand in it, I knew it had to be something special.

At first I thought it was really good. Most of the characters had a nice vibe to them that made up for them not being direct copies of the comic. Especially, Penguin. The story line is bad-ass, the soundtrack is great, and the kid actors ARE ACTUALLY GOOD , for their age anyway.

They only thing I really hate about this show is...Barbara. I can not stand her. At first I was okay with her, but later she just started pissing me off. She adds so much unneeded drama (and drama clichés), and she over-reacts to everything. And all of those "romantic" clichés she brings in are just cringe-worthy. Hell, I even learned to love Harvey Bullock.

But overall, I absolutely can't get enough of Gotham. I hope to see more in the later years.
