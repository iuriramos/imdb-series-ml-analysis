I really appreciate the story of series. I like batman trio-logy most in story. When I found that Gotham is connected to that, I started to watch this series.

And yeah its amazing. I got all the answers of my questions which came in front of me while watching series episodes in line. The last episode was very amazing. The nice anxiousness you have bring to this series'lovers like me. Acting of Gordan, Penguin, fish & yeah exactly Bruce Alfred and Selina is very appreciable. Curiously waiting for the next part. Please let me inform when it will be launched in there. I suggest to add more romantic scenes to energize the story contain. Now the game is on with Penguin and Falcone in Gotham city. What will Penguin do to his friend Jim? What will Bruce and Alfred find as Bruce's father's secret? What will Barbara do for getting her love back? oh god, all those questions make me more curious.. So please publish all new episodes of Gotham with new story. Lovers are waiting for that. Thank you again.
