Simply work of art. Acting, scenery, script and story line all aspects of this series are flawlessly created. As is the case in many sci fi works, reality never abandons the story. sci fi has been carefully blended into the reality and no point in time it feels that if its unreal. I am eagerly awaiting season 2 of this awesome piece production. At no point in time during the episodes there is a sense of boredom due to monotonous story line. Benjamin Mckenzie and Jada Pinkett Smith have delivered powerful acting. And the creators have no doubt done one hell of a job. Cinematography is top notch. This series brilliantly explains the origin of batman and blends in with the franchise.
