Gotham is an amazing series so far. The Series immerses you in the city of Gotham. Gordan is well played and brought to life by actor Ben McKenzie. His roots are well defined and "Harvey Bullock" whom any Batman fan will recognize is amazingly well played by actor Donal Logue. The series so far has more villains than heroes and this kind of answers the question why the "Batman" came about. The series so far sticks to "Nolan's" idea of the DC universe and keeps the villains true to life. Hopefully the origin and eventual emergence of the Batman follows the same writing structure. Young Bruce (to become the batman)is well played by David Mazouz. I wonder if the the series will follow the comic book cannon, but I think NOT to some extent. Anyway's the series is worth the attention of any comic book fan or someone just looking for a good thrilling well written series.
