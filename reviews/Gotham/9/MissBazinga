Honestly, I don't really know why I started watching Gotham in the first place since it's not the type of series I would normally go for. But I soon realised, whatever it was that made me start...it was strong enough for me to never want it to end. 

Gotham captures you within the first few seconds. The outstanding cinematography - from the music to wardrobe and set - helps you immerse yourself in the dark city ruled by crime. With interesting mysteries solved in every episode, the underlying greater puzzle of who killed Bruce Wayne's (played by the brilliant David Mazouz) parents gets even more complicated and interesting. Detectives James Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Harvey (Donal Logue) have great partnership, while all the other characters (including those who will develop into some of Batman's archenemy's) have been cleverly cast and have their own parallel story lines to keep them all relevant and relatable. 

I can't stress enough how much everyone needs Gotham in their lives. If you're a fan of clever mystery-solving, with a dark side that centres on the drama and doesn't fall into gore-overload or sexual over exposure to capture adepts...then Gotham is for you.
