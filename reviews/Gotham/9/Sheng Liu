I have a feeling this is going to be my favorite season for Gotham just from watching the first episode alone. Not only is the storytelling more suspenseful, it's also more structured. All the scenes felt necessary and showed great development in each character as the show went along. It's incredible to see how far all these characters have come since the previous season. Gordon has stopped being the white knight he was portrayed as in the first season. He's no longer the upstanding detective with unbreakable virtues. He's starting to believe that in order for him to do some good in this city, he's going have to break a few rules. He made some terrible decisions that I can already see will affect him as this season continues on.

This first episode also shows you where Barbara, Bruce, Alfred, Selena, and Penguin have advanced; sadly no Fish, but I'm sure she'll appear soon enough. This interaction between Bruce and Alfred has been the high point of the episode for me. It's great to see the young man develop into who we know will be Batman in the future, and a large part of that is because of Alfred. It's almost comical how these two interact with each other, and I'm really liking the chemistry and acting from these two.

Overall, amazing first episode. Show great development story-wise in many of the main characters. I can't wait to watch the next episode, give this show a chance guys!
