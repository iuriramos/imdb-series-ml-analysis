I was afraid to be disappointed, but I am not. The much effort and work put into this is amazing. All of the Cast are great and Special Effects are terrific. Not one Episode has let me down. I hope that can stay like that. Besides I like stuff like this, that tell how the Character became who he/she is, also known as Origin Story's. This is also based in New York, where I have visited. Also it pulls you into the action and massacre in Gotham. I'd rate this an 8 out of 10 because nothing is ever perfect, so that's why my Rating is like that. I hoped this short review as made you decide on watching it or not. Trust me on this, you'd probably like it. I would recommend this to someone that likes Comics, Heroes, and Villains.
