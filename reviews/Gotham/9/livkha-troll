Thoroughly entertaining series. Bingewatched both seasons and can't wait for the next one. Actors do great job and as a Batman fan I enjoy watching Gotham becoming the city we all know and love. One thing Batman franchise has always done well is it's villains and this series is no exception. Seeing Penguin and E.Nigma become the character we know is interesting as the result of their struggle is both known and still interesting to watch. I love Bruce Wayne as a kid too mature for his age and yet occasionally falling to the very natural traps that usually threaten prepubescent boys.I am no expert in the art of movies or TV and hence I judge these mainly through how enjoyable they are to watch and Batman is 10/10 in that regard. I highly recommend.
