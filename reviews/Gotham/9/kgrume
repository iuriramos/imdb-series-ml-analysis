I've always like Batman and all his villains, so watching how Bruce Wayne becomes the Batman its simply amazing. Every episode feels like a new story, watching detective Gordon catching some bad guys, but with a big story behind. One of the most interesting parts of Gotham is how the villains are being develop, it is simply amazing, at least I love it. I just finished the first season and it is true that some episodes are kind of slow (like a couple) but still love the history behind every episode and the acting of Ben McKenzie and Donal Logue are great! but Robin Lord Taylor and Cory Michael Smith are fantastic! Hope you like this show, 8.5/10 for me.
