The final episode of season one was quite impressive. We see Fish Mooney and other leading underworld figures wiped out and it seems The Penguin and The Riddler and other rising super villains are set to take over. As for Selina Kyle she shows in this episode that there is really not much difference between her and Fish Mooney. She of course survives but it is beyond me why young Bruce Wayne would even want someone like that as a girlfriend. The fact that she pushed Alfred's attacker of that building should have told him enough about her. You have to feel sorry for Barbara Keene, her story is quite a tragedy. Still, I personally don't think that she did kill her parents, this is some delusion that she has. We should find out next season and see where her character goes from here. Falcone gets to walk away smelling of roses which isn't right you feel. We do get a look at Bat Cave in the final scene so I think the stage is set for a promising return in the fall and I certainly look forward to that.
