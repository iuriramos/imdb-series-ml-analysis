i was extremely excited to see the first episode of this from the first time I saw a trailer and it has been a blast sense them never boring not really about batman but more about the town of Gotham but the show is still in the face action love the excitement and the trills finding new things to like about the show every week love how the characters keep getting more in to the story i love the love hate relationship between Bruce Wayne and cat-woman just adds fun mystery to the show 'not to parents 'the world of Gotham can be a quite graphic place with very merciless violence at times so be careful when the smallest of kids are around but I love it can't wait to see the second season
