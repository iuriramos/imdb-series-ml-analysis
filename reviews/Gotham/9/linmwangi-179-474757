Gotham city.... does this city really exit, and is it so corrupt like we are shown in the movie?

Jim Gordon is the superman of the town, its like he is on a mission to clean the town from where his dad left. I just love his simplicity and his kind heart.

The movie is really interesting, one is left with the argue to know what will really happen in the next episode.. I just love it so much I would like to know if Gordon will marry Barbara and if not will Barbara get back with her ex lover the police lady? and what will really happen to 'penguin' and falcon. and if I may ask is the story based on a real story or what?
