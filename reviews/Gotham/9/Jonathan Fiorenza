Gotham is a non-stop thrill ride. I have often found myself on the edge of my seat episode after episode due to its unpredictability. The thing I like most about this show is the character James Gordan. I love how committed and driven he is to doing what is right, no matter what the cost to himself. The only thing I'm worried about is where this show is going. They have already introduced the Joker in the first season. Bruce Wayne is at least 10 years away from being Batman. I don't know where they are going after this season. I fear the show may come to a sizzling halt. But for now, I will enjoy it for the excitement it provides, even if it is for a short time only.
