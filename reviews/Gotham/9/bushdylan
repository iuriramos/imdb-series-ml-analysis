I have seen this show from start to finish so far and I'm enjoying the hell out of it! Sure the characters from the comics are completely different sometimes and the comic time lines are mixed up but this is a new age for origins and back stories! Not only was this show a very cool take on the stories we all know and love but it also adds new and improved things that were needed in the batman time line. But at times you get confused with things, like Barbra Keen for ex. She was supposed to have Barbra Gordon in the future and soon the little geek would become bat-girl! But now knowing that Lee Thompkins is pregnant, they might have to use some cross hair to make that baby bat-girl. It's things like that make the show somewhat weird after awhile. But I am confused about 1 main thing about the show, It's that if Jim Gordon is basically the hero of the show and he's going take down people like Hugo strange and Mr.Freeze than who is batman gonna face in the future. Don't get me wrong Mr.Freeze is a cool choice but I thought that he turned that Victor turned the way he was when batman was around! I do think that he will be some sort of Hugo strange experiment so it might be fine for the future, and maybe it would be cool if Hugo was using Nora as a hostage! But we will have to see!

We have seen different versions of certain characters like firefly; As we all know the role will be taken by Garfeild in the future. I think using the characters when they are younger makes us feel more excited for what they are going to be in the future.

But if people are outraged by some of these choices then remember that not only is this show it's own cannon, it's for fun and that is what makes Gotham awesome!
