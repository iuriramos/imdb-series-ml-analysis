Describes: A term used in musical notation to indicate a certain degree of intensity of sound, a dynamic nuance. The intensity pointing is very high at above and below forte fortississimo.

nd that is this series something forward, leaving his wings to become something bigger and better. What happens in Gotham? Evolution. 

Both plot and characters, and it feels good. The Pilot is 6, Chapter 2 is 7 and so on to the last, which crowns a 9 without compromise. Bruno Heller is creating something well, a series with the same intention of Nolan's films. I welcome this and hope to see before the end of the season, the villain of Batman every fan expected.
