Always been a big "Batman" fan and I just had to watch this new FOX series called "Gotham". And it doesn't let you down it's full of entertainment and thrills as it seems like a timeless series even though you feel like your in modern day Gotham. Set before the dawn of Batman and the uprising of his villains the series starts with the brutal murder and slaying of Bruce Wayne's parents. From then on each week the episodes follow the trail and life work of a rising and up and coming detective named Jim Gordon(Ben McKenzie)as he along with his wet and somewhat hard and worn like garment partner Bullock(Donal Logue)battle the streets of dangerous criminals all while dealing with a city of corruption that has ties to politics, money and the mob. As a scene stealer the sexy Jada Pinkett Smith is devious and very aggressive like as a mob crime family boss and nightclub owner Fish Mooney. This series not only traces the rise of a yet to be hero like Batman and a future commissioner like Gordon, it also shows the early origins of criminals in the making like "The Riddler" and "Catwoman". Most eye catching is the ghoulish and crazy like start of Oswald Cobblepot(the future penguin played to near perfection by Robin Lord Taylor). This series is better than most for it's entertaining and exciting take on the development of a hero like Batman while he's aided from a caring young detective and mixed with the outrageous and wild criminals in the making make "Gotham" a romp and a glory watch!
