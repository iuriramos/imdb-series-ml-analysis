Gotham is a TV series that takes place in Gotham City before Batman exists and Bruce Wayne is still young. Gotham has received a lot of negativity and criticism, and I was once part of this negativity as well. So when checking out this new show with low expectations, it was actually pretty good. I mean, it might be very different, and not stay true to the comics and kind of a, as people have said, a f*ck you to the comics, but that might actually be a good thing. So Bruce Wayne's parents still die, not a huge spoiler, pretty much everyone in the world knows this. I noticed how Jim's story is using the Year One one (Jim and Barbara are forced to move to Gotham) which I think is pretty cool and makes sense. Gotham is great show because it's DIFFERENT and there's nothing wrong with that for me. While some others whine and whine how the show is "Joel Schumacher all over again" and a, as I said earlier, a f*ck you to the comics, and I think they just can't accept anything DIFFERENT for once from their original source material. Do you know how boring it would be for EVERY version of a story to be the SAME?
