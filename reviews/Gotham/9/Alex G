First of,I started watching the series with high hopes,just to find out after the first 5 episodes or so that it totally delivers!This show has it all and the acting is so good,I actually cannot name 1 single character played badly or even mediocre.All of the characters evolve in their special and unique way,also,the madness portrayed is so diverse and intense,it makes you crave more.

I also like the fact that there are lots of twists in the story,and that it takes it's time to unravel,meaning it's not rushing anything.

One thing I would enjoy would be a special episode dedicated to Alfred (awesome acting BTW),maybe about how he became the butler in the first place,and his life story.

All in all,I seriously recommend this show.I think it has been said before but I feel like stressing it again : as long as you keep an open mind and do not take "gotham" being the same thing as a "batman" series,it totally gets you!
