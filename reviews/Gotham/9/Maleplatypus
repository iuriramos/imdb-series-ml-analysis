This is a show that excels in everything but writing. As some mentioned in their reviews, this could be far better(therefore not full ten stars rating). So many chances for making a joke or a witty dialog, yet it remains flat too many times. Should there be another season (and there should be! Please, don't cancel it as so many good shows before!), writing is really something to work on. Cast is perfect, scenography, music, that odd mixture of eras, the dark atmosphere, direction, acting ... and that beautiful smile of one of the most beautiful women ever: Morena Baccarin of Firefly. Yes, most of the outcomes are indeed predictable (otherwise there would be no movies with major villains) but this is the content we've been waiting for: what happened before Batman became the ... Batman. The same goes for the others (both good and bad guys and gals). Something to watch and get addicted to quickly. Highly recommended.
