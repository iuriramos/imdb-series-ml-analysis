Gotham is by far the best series of all DC and Marvel series running right now (Arrow comes in second). Ben McKenzie, who is voice of Batman in Batman: Year One (one of the best Batman animation movies), does a great job as young Detective Gordon. Donal Logue, who I know from his weird role in Sons of Anarchy, is his sidekick. He does a way better job here. Many super interesting background stories to characters I didn't know too much about (I am not a super fan). I never looked at these characters without Batman dominating the story. You get to see the best Penguin and Riddler in television/movie history. The stories are interesting and character pool is huge. Acting is good and although "comical" never cheesy. I recommend this to all Batman fans and I hope you enjoy it.
