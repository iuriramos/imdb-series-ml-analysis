This show is better than any other show of it's kind. We are seeing the foundation being built for one of the best series ever. Not one detail presented in this show seems wasted, and everything leads to something, and the pay-off is worth the 40+ minutes. Gotham is like watching a movie divided up into chapters.

Parts of Gotham are clich√© but again, it all builds to something else. The Flash would be it's only equal in regards to pacing involving plot and character development of a 'comic book show'. Gotham is the exception in that every character gets a minute or two to show you why they are there. This show relies on itself, not connections to larger universes. Batman is an amazingly timeless character, and it is a thrill to see him developed in detail.

The groundwork laid within the storytelling has made each character worth knowing, and the events that take place in the show make the next one worth watching. It's almost a shame, the stigmata of the premise of Gotham, it is based on a comic book and better than most of them combined, I might add.
