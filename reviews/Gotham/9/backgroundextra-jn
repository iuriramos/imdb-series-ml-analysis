I am a sucker for a juicy plot twist.

Gotham has a few good ones, And the show's crisply executed reversals, not to mention its unique murders, sustained me through the first three episode. this is exquisitely executed show will have the audience hurting for those perfectly executed scenes to entice the soul and the mind with all the aspects of the love for this type of show.

I applied at the open casting call and hope I can become part of this show. I would make an excellent Bruce Wayne if the show grows in the direction of casting a grown-up version.
