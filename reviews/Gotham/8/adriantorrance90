When Gotham was announced back in 2014, I was excited. This was going to be the next Heroes (the first season only). This was going to be THE show. Needless to say, that did not eventuate.

I only watched seven episodes in the first season. The "Penguin's Umbrella" episode was the final straw. It was a dumb, poorly-written, poorly-acted show. It had squandered its potential.

But I heard good things about season two, so just two days ago, I started watching. (Don't worry, I read spoilers about everything else that happened in the first season, and stupidly, the second)

The show is leaps and bounds over what it used to be. The wackiness feels just right, the characters are more interesting...it just feels like less of a waste of time.

Even though I knew everything that was going to happen in the second season before I watched it, I still enjoyed it highly and I cannot wait for its return on Leap Day (March 1st in my time zone). Shout-out to Empire and Blindspot, two shows I'm also waiting for.

RATING: 8.5/10. I'd round it up but it's not really a 9/10 show.
