I love Gotham and it is such an easy show to binge watch. Harvey and Jim work great as a team together once you get past the first few episodes. Jada Pinket Smith does a wonderful job as well during Season 1. The story lines have just enough twists to stay interesting and not be too predictable. Though sometimes the show gets a little cheesy but it makes up for it in acting and story lines. My only complaint is the character Barbara, Gordon's love interest, her character in the show is poorly written and I can't tell if she is also not a very good actress or if her character's lines and actions are so bad that there is no hope for her character. Every action that Barbara does is very expected and the opposite of what Gordon suggests that she do. I can't believe they are still together with all the stupid things her character does and their acting chemistry is not good. However, everything else about the show is great!
