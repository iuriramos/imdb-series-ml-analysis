I went in with a flexible mind set. I knew it wasn't 100% DC Universe, but it was a solid show. The first episode was the weakest (I've watched the first 3) but it did get better - now i'm hooked. The characters are relatable and the actors give off solid performances (Donal Logue is good as Harvey Bullock). Its actually quite witty and the characters almost 'bounce' off each other - if that makes sense to you, you know what i mean. I just hope it doesn't drag on too long at becomes dry and recycled.

Good through out and slightly addictive. Watch if you like DCU and/or Batman. J
