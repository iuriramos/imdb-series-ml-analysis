SCORE- 8/10

It may not have the caped crusader but new crime fighting TV show 'Gotham' does the D.C Universe justice keeping the dark tone and corrupt city. With Bruno Heller as show runner and Ben McKenzie starring as Detective James Gordon this is a solid opening episode. 

There is plenty of familiar names which are introduced to please fans. Our opening scene sees Serena Kyle (Camren Bicondova) up to no good. Not long after a incident of petty theft from a passing citizen she witnesses Thomas and Margaret Wayne being threaten at gun point along with their young son, Bruce. When his parents are shot Harvey Bullock and a young James Gordon are called to the scene of the crime. Gordon makes a promise to Bruce that he will find the man responsible. 

This show has the potential to be to Batman what Smallville was to Superman. The show make good us of the 45 minute run time by not only introducing our main character but also introducing plenty of supporting characters which are clearly going to play crucial roles as the series progresses. 

Camren Bicondova's performance was a highlight and would of been hard to see this show without Serena Kyle because of her complex personality which fits in with the show. It may not be connected to the Batman reboot like Marvel Agents of Shield is to the Marvel Universe but if this opener is anything to go by it is going to be a great TV show and will please both DC fans and newcomers alike.
