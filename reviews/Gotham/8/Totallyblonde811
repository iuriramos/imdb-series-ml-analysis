I hate how people keep saying that the acting is "overacting". It is based off of a comic book. The acting is supposed to be over the top and not "normal" life. I really think this show is great. It truly incorporates the Tim Burton Batman and the Chris Nolan Batman beautifully. 

I was fully expecting to go into the show and having it be just like any other crime/cop show so am grateful that it is not. What other people may call "overacting" I call great acting. I am not familiar with they guy who plays James Gordon, but I am familiar with the guy who plays Harvey. The guy who plays Harvey has played a variety of rolls and just like all the other characters he plays, he nails this one. I can see how people think and it may seem it's over the top but that is the point!! It is a comic book!!
