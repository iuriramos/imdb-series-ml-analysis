It had a rocky start in season 1, didn't like the first 3 episode at all. But i thinks this series its been better and better each season. Season 1 started out bad but became good at the end of the series. The mob story was very interesting. I like Gordon Ben is a good actor, had a hard time with bruce and alfred at the beginning but they are really growing as the series goes on.

One of the things gotham had a problem with is that they introduce so many characters at the same time. e have Ed ( riddler) Oswald( penguin ) Falcon , Ivy, Selena (cat women) Jerome( joker?) scarecrow mad hatter ,victor freeze already introduce. One of my least favorites is Fish mooney, she "died" in s 1 but came back in s2-3. 

Ifthink both alfred and bruce is getting better and better for each season. Season 2 was really great the first half, but Galavan was to much at sometimes. Strange was a great character. Season 3 have had a good start. No episode yet ( of 4) have been bad or horrible. They have all had they enjoyable moments. 

The series can be to silly or to much sometimes. But in each episode there is some good qualities and some good character moments. The plot is moving forward in a good way. 

I would recommend to skip the first 3-4 episodes s 1 half of s 1- second half to first half s 2 has been the best. But s 3 as i said a good start. I really hope this series can at least have 6-7 seasons. Bruce journey its getting better and better and i think gordon also dose a good job. 

Sure the series has some weak points they need to work on, but overall a enjoyable show
