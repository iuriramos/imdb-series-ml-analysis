This series is brilliant, I have run out of superlatives to describe this series, it's just amazing.

Although I am a massive Batman fan that is not the reason I began watching and give this serious props though it was a big factor to its popularity.

I think that its good enough to not be called 'Gotham' and could have had nothing to do with the Batman and still be a hit, but the fact that it is called Gotham and takes on the story of the City Of Gotham brings greater credibility and appeals to wider target audience.

The actor are FAB! The guy who plays officer Gordon is a great actor and he does very good job, hes kind and justice enforcing but you can still fell the salt in him.

The criminals are also well interpreted, a bit animated at times but that what I like about it personally, I've had friends tell me they don't want to watch because they don't want to endorse the fact that all these characters somehow met uo with one another when they were younger, though I understand I do not agree as upon watching everything seems well portrayed and well jigsawed. 

The mayor looks and acts soo much like the joker and even calls them 'Jokers', though I highly doubt its him as he is significantly older than Bruce.

But to conclude its got a great story, great actors and well thought-out premises.
