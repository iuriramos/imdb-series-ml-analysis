I can't say how much I was looking forward for this show , and yet it proves to be up to my expectations !

"Gotham" is what happened before Batman saw the light - or the darkness!

It's been enjoyable since the very first scene ! I can't say how much perfect the characters and the actors and the direction are ! and best of all that queer feeling that there's so much awesomeness we are gonna see in the next weeks !

Let's hope for the good , after all the down-to-expectations shows I we had recently, this is one of the few best shows this fall.
