Gotham is about the origin story behind Commissioner James Gordon's rise to prominence in Gotham City in the years before Batman's arrival. This is a review of the new TV show on fox. i think its a great show with an interesting new spin on the infamous series about batman etc. Give it a shot! I like it a lot, and I'm really picky about what i watch :)

i personally love how the after plays the penguin! and cat woman is brilliantly cast ! the girl that plays her is doing a great job ! lots of charisma and lots of character!

and the kid playing Bruce Wayne is really catching the "hurt kid" role perfectly !

here is a VIDEO review of the show ENJOY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ8IJob71Qw
