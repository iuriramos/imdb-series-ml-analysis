Gotham could have been all kinds of bad but to my surprise it has been a joy to watch.

Sure the script is a little shonky and the standard of acting a smorgasbord of delights but this kind of pales against the tone, which for me, is absolutely spot on.

Gotham could have been really camp. However, while it doesn't have quite the same level of gritty realism delivered by Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy (a good thing in my opinion), it has the perfect balance of menace and violence needed to really bring this tortured city to life.

Thankfully the creators are not afraid to show the true darkness that exists in Gotham. There is nothing comic book about the beatings of the blood letting.

I have to say that I am loving Ben McKenzie's Jim Gordon (without which the show would be an instant and epic fail) and Lord Taylor's Penguin is pitch perfect. 

We're only 2 episodes in but I have not enjoyed a show this much in a long time. 

I'm really looking forward to how it develops and can only hope that it can maintain the high standard that it has already achieved.

To be honest, to pull off a Batman franchise piece without Batman and not miss him is a real achievement. 

Well done all!
