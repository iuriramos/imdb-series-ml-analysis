OK! after Nolan's trilogy i definitely wanted more,finally i have something worth my time.Though you cant really say what this eventually becomes,but as of now its pretty good.A new personality is given to Gordon which is refreshing,though it seems batman is surely not coming before season 3(i'd love if they end season 2 with a glimpse of batman).I personally am not liking Alfred's character(irritating).Love the gang war thing going on,penguin climbing up the ladder in the underworld world.If you want something other than solving a case in each episode with some superhero with his nerdy friends this one is for you(referring to Arrow and Flash). I just don't want it to be stretched,actors are doing a fine job Gotham has that overall dull gloomy look,cinematography and dialogues can be improved(show more of Gotham and not just the people).Penguins character is a delight doesn't seem to fit the original Penguin.Plus would love to see joker's story(unless penguin is actually joker 0.0).Adding background score always helps.
