When I heard about this show coming out, I really didn't care. But after watching a few episodes, it's not only good, but the show knows what it's doing. It's creative see these younger versions of Bruce, Alfred, Penguin, Riddler, James Gordon, and more. But it also has lots of fantastic scenes. Like the scene with Jerome (by the way, that actor will make a GREAT joker.), the ones where young Bruce and Selina interact with each other, and how can even beat a bully up even before becoming Batman. It's a good show. But what makes it fall behind is for me is that a couple episodes just aren't as strong as others and the other characters aren't that interesting. Really, what could Jada Pinkett Smith do as a crime boss? This was a woman who played A HIPPO IN "MADAGASCAR". But the main characters are great. It's creative, has good drama, some good touching moments, sprinkled with unforgettable moments. And I can't wait to see what season 2 can do. So far, it's on a good start. Y'know? HA HA HA HA HA!üëçüèª
