Gotham is a dark,gritty show which shows the time before Batman, before the villains came to be known. We come to the scene with Bruce Wayne's parents being shot in an alley, then comes detective Gordon, the main character of the show. An incorruptible detective in a corrupted city.

We meet several other Batman comic characters like Catwoman, The Riddler/Edward Nygma, Poison Ivy Scarecrow, and the two main rival Dons- Falcone and Maroni. And of course my favorite character of this show The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Taylor). He stole the whole season 1. :) We see the state of Gotham city, it's people and the mafia and the police.

This show has the potential to being one of the greatest comic book shows. Sure, it has some stupid character(s) and the characters making stupid decisions. There are some plots which are just for the sake of filling in the episodes. Overall this show is a fresh look on Gotham and the rise of it's Heroes and Villains.
