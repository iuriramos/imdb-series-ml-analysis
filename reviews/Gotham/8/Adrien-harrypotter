Gotham season 1: 8/10 

Season one was amazing with the wars between Carmine Falcone,Dom Maroni and Fish Mooney including Oswald cobblepot all trying to rise to power. I thought the story is good, the acting wasn't too bad neither the special effects. I like how they approached this TV show with dark gritty episodes compared to the approach for the flash. The season finale was amazing. I loved the confrontation between Penguin and Fish mooney. In all season 1 was amazing and i recommend it to all.

Gotham season 2: 7/10 The beginning of season 2 was literally AMAZING.Instead of having normal police cases they were getting more into the villains which i thought was great. I thought it was starting to be better than season 1. After the mid season break it was still going well but then the episodes were starting to go down a bit and not really being that interesting except for the fabulous episode "into the woods" which has been the best episode yet and "pinewood" which i found quite interesting. I thought the season finale was not nearly as amazing as seasons one finale and it could have been done better.

Still i am very excited for season 3 and i hope it doesn't get less interesting after the mid season break like season 2.
