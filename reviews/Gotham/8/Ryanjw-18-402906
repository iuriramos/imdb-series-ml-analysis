OK, I'm going to start by saying that I do understand why some people do not like the show, but after watching the whole series, the show just gets better and better as it goes on. There are only 2 bad actors in the show in my opinion, but they are over shadowed by great acting and great story telling...most of the time, the show does have bad episodes but they are pretty much at the start of the series it gets so much better. And the plot twists and stories will hopefully keep you entertained. At some times the stories are so intense and thrilling that you forget it's even a prequel, you end up thinking "oh my god is he going to die ? or her ?". I do understand the gripes people have with the show, but when a show has 22 episodes a series there will always be up's and down's but the up's out weigh the down's by miles. This is a must see for anyone who wants to see the story of some of The Batman's greatest foes and allies or anyone who just wants to see a great, gripping and intense story.
