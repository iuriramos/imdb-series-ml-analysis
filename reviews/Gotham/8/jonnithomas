The setting is in line with the grimy grainy movies that have become the hallmark of the Batman genre. It's Gotham before batman and it works well.

The acting is solid and showing some depth. It's a very very good start which hopefully they can keep up. I wasn't sure I could watch it as I am rather a fan and expected a lacklustre TV series due to costs. That's not what has been presented at all. All I can say is it works and works well. Yes, I'm repeating myself but it's so true.

It manages to have good characterisation of the main roles but still manages to be somehow comic book. Gordon, Alfred and Bruce are worth watching and are easy to believe.

I know some people are being critical of the series but don't be put off by them. Watch it and make your own mind up. May we have many episodes of this high quality series.
