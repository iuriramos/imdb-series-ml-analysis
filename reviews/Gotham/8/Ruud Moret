I am not a fan of superhero movies, series or comic books. But I like the concept of a TV-series based on a comic. I know a thing or two about Batman - I'm certainly not tabula rasa - but that's all. To a viewer like me Gotham looks refreshing and entertaining. It's a breath of fresh air - in a manner of speaking - after seeing thousands of episodes of police series like Law & Order, CSI, Criminal Minds, as well as boring sci-fi series like V, Continuum, Extant, etc. Watching the pilot I had no expectations whatsoever, but this is the first time since Sleepy Hollow that I really enjoyed a new series. Ben McKenzie is excellent as the cop with integrity, and Donal Logue is OK as the cynical cop. Camren Bicondova was great in the pilot (having watched only the first two episodes at present I hope she'll do some more cat moving and jumping later - I understand she's a good dancer as well). Jada Pinkett Smith is wonderful - in fact there is not one actor in this series who seems to be miscast. Even Richard Kind, whom I know from Spin City and used to consider a comedian, is perfect as the mayor. I have been around for a while, but as I've said I'm not into comic-book TV-series. Still, from what I have seen so far I'm looking forward to seeing more episodes of Gotham. Hell, I'm beginning to regret I never watched more than the occasional Batman or Superman movie and skipped Clark & Lois and those other TV-series. (No, I don't. Gotham is entertaining, but it ain't Sin City.)
