Old enough to recall reading the original comic books (read them but not that old) and I recall they had a noir quality about them that was absent as Batman entered the 1950's, I found the first episode harkened back to the beginning and yet it was a bit over the top in violence. I base that last comment on the character of Oswald Cobblepot emerging from the river and slicing a man's throat in order to take his food. Overall, I enjoyed the cast and found Ben McKenzie excellent as the young James Gordon. It should be an intriguing show as we see the origins of the Batman's iconic villains. And David Mazouz does a fine job of being the young Bruce Wayne. Looking forward to seeing Camren Bicondova develop her character, Selina Kyle. I hope this show finds an audience because if the quality can be maintained the show has the potential to become a classic.
