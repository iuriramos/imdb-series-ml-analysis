This show is good on so many levels. The main topic is root of friendship between Bruce Wayne and James Gordon from the time when Bruce was just a scared kid who just witnessed murder of parents and James was a police detective. We see how it all started, how they become more then just a friends. Writers are committed to comic-book roots of stories and all comic-book fans will enjoy the show. Many origin stories are shown and it helps to understand nature of some characters in later movies and other shows.

I am, personally, very pleased with Sean Pertwee portrayal of Alfred Pennyworth although some people didn't like it. Producer did very good job showing Alfred in different light, the one that we note used to. Very protective and not so slow and uptight like the all other, older, versions of him. Sometimes he is even cool Englishman.

Ben McKenzie as Gordon. I can say that he is just awesome. Through the show you can see why later in career he was considered a legend in the force. Sometimes you can compare him with Eliot Ness when he go alone against all. All other actors did a great job with they characters, best of them of course Robin Lord Taylor as Oswald "Penguin" Cobblepot.

All in all, the show is great, the actors are great, younger audience will like the show for it's action and actors and older audience will like it for complexity of stories and comic-book origins.

Enjoy it.
