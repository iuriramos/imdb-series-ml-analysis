Wow, the show started with a bang Really Liked it to see Penguin rising. Can't wait the 2nd season to come. Good acting by every actor in the show especially Jada Smith. But I'm really missing Any vigilante or Batman Itself on the show. The Only thing I didn't liked about show is that it really got a bit mild in the mid season but picked up it's pace. Would really be happy to see the Batwoman arc because she's Officer Gordon wife ad i Went through the comics. The Bottom Line: As a Child I grew up seeing Batman now it's great to see the background of the villains in the story. It'll be good to see if Batman comes in the show And every children out there if you want to know about the show this is the place.
