I am enjoying this series, it has quite a bit of potential, and i'm sure my review is not going to help anyone, but i needed a forum to vent, Good Christ almighty, Jada Pinkett Smith can't act for shizit!!, if she uses those eyebrows and lip sneers one more time, i swear her face is going to permanently freeze that way,... or so my mom tells me when i make faces at her like that. There is some terrible overacting there, and for me she is the worst part of this show. They should recast her character, she needs to go!!! Aside from that the tone and mood of the show is great, i'm enjoying the Dark ominous, gritty feeling of it.
