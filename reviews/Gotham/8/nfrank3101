I liked the story of the pilot, it thoroughly entertained me and I hope the rest of the series is good as well. Some reviews I have read complained about the bad acting. I would mostly disagree. I think that the actors were fine, but the writing was terrible and the actors were just doing the best they could with what they were given. Some of the dialogue was hard to take seriously, but it wasn't the actors' faults. Despite this I do agree that some of the actors could have done better, especially the wife of the guy that killed Bruce Wayne's parents. She was painful to watch. I have also seen reviews saying that too much action was stuffed into the pilot. This may be an unpopular opinion, but all the action made me want to continue watching the series. Also, I really liked some of the camera angles, the director did a good job. So to summarize, bad writing, good story, good cinematography, overall a good pilot.
