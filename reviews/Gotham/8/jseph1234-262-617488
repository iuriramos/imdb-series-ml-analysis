The show had some interesting moral dilemmas and one thing that I have to keep in mind is that they can't pack the entire season into one episode. They can only introduce the beginnings of the threads and hope they are enough to keep the viewer's attention.

Having said that, I think there were more of the Bruce Wayne superiority, "perfectness" which galls me and as you watch you will see what I mean. Also, campyness from the 1960's "Batman" which I loathe and feel is inappropriate for this. To further expand on that I just wouldn't want the show to descend into some ridiculous laugh-fest I gave it a 6.5 and rounded it up to 7
