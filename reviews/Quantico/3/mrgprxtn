Everything about this thing is mediocre. The acting, directions, dialogues, plot, casting.. practically everything about this is amateurish and mediocre. And special mention must be made of the lead's mediocrity. Did they get her to act for free? Did they think they were getting a good deal? What were they thinking? This girl can't act if her life depended on it. And her accent is as fake as Pamela Anderson's tits. This is probably the worst pilot in a long, long time. Just when we were beginning to think that we were in the golden age of television, in comes Quantico and demolishes it single-handedly. Watch it while it lasts, people. There's not going to be a second season on this steaming pile of feces. Also, looks like Priyanka's PR team is on an overdrive here trying to astroturf reviews. I'm sure people can see through that quite easily.
