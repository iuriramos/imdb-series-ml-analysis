I watched till episode hoping for something but trust me there is none, it's just.

Watch a few episodes and believe me nothing makes sense. So poorly written.

The protagonist is so hard to love aside from her beauty. She's supposed to really talented. All throughout episode 13, not once did she have a badass moment. And of course, her ex- boyfriend is even worse. The whole FBI is so weak, they can't seem to deal with any situation. Not only that but the way they solve problems are never explained, it's honestly very poorly written.

The supporting characters stories are even worse. Alright enough, have a good day.
