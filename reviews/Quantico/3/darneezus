A show that started with lots of promise, has effectively spun out of control and has become a circus of boring plot twists and terribly written emotional scenes. Throughout the first season, the script gradually goes from intense investigating and wonderful character building, to the main character, Alex Parrish, becoming nothing better than a teenage girl after a heart break. Every other scene she is either crying and whining almost incoherently or begging some character to believe her.

It seems the writers may have gotten in over their heads. Maybe there are too many characters with too many unnecessary plot twists every single episode, or maybe it's the fact that no 2 scenes are ever related to each other, maybe it's a combination of both. Too often it seems like the show is just trying to keep the story together rather than progress it smoothly. It has since gotten very convoluted and hard to follow. I found myself having to watch some episodes twice just to follow some silly plot twist. Watching Quantico is feeling more like studying a game tape than being entertained by a television show.
