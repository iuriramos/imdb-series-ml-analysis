It was Nice and exciting when it all started..we use to wait for new episode..now.. i feel like its being dragged unnecessarily without any good story..1 bomb blast ..then another bomb...then another bomb...What is director thinking i guess he doesn't know..instead of creating suspense..we loosing interest as the same story goes on and on and on..I would say not so catchy..and just getting bored every episode...should have a good story ..when we think someone is a bomber..again its changed to something else..i don't see any logic or wise story..should have some clues and suspense...at the moment Priyanka just running around ,crying and seeking help from others which seems like a stupid idea !
