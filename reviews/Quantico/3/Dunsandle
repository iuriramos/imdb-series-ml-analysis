This one jumped the shark before the end of the pilot episode. Shame really, as it had looked promising up till then. Young FBI recruit finds herself in the middle of a conspiracy, but sure enough, our credulity is finally stretched past breaking point. Looks like The Blacklist's going that way too. Pity the networks continue to insult viewers' intelligence. It's getting harder to winnow out quality drama from all the superhero, comic-book fodder, not to mention those relentlessly tiresome reality shows (reality, who are they kidding?). Thank goodness for Nordic noir and similarly inspired shows like Fargo, Unforgotten and River.
