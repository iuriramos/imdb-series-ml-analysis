Not a big deal ! If you are from India and have seen Priyanka in the Hindi movies, this will probably move you. Something about this series is Indian Melo Drama. Priyanka acting seems like hard work on her, thrives to get there, has sperky skin, fat lipsticky lips, blown up hair, weird squinty look, stabbed nose with nose job and weird struggling body language. Its just not natural and not suitable for the role !

The FBI theme of the series is promising, i hope does pull off smooth eventually. The big difference between Indian stars and Hollywood is the effort to stand out VS actually standing out and being the best. 

Its not moving me !
