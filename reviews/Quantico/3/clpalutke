The show had some real potential but the contrived flash back flash forward was a real let down. It is hard to sustain over a large story and detracts from the character development and plot progression. It was an overused gimmick. I watched the entire season rooting for this show, which had promise, but never pulled through. At some point they should have focused on the class in training and developed the interpersonal relations and fleshed out the characters and then moved forward with the future story lines. It seems as if they just drop these people into any point with no cohesion of motivation, history, development. They created entire side stories that fell off into nothing. "First we broke you then we molded you" is constantly referred to, but never in fact felt by the audience and in the end the class just was not a unit despite the writers instance that somehow that relationship existed. I really wanted to like this show, but it disappoints on so many levels.
