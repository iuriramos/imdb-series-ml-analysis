I understand that network TV dramas need a certain type of charisma from their actors, but the selected crew here are just not believable as FBI trainees. They are too pretty and the group lacks realism as an entry Quantico class.

The contrived tragedy that happens to one of the trainees during a class is totally unbelievable. Assuming that there might be some later connection down the line is the best I can excuse the screen writers. If there is no call back to this "surprise" in the first act, then it really is inexcusable. 

One of the reviews I have read, makes a comparison to Homeland. This show is no where near the quality of Homeland in script writing, acting, or production. Unfortunately I will not likely take the time to see this one further.
