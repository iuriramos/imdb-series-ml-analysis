I won't go into all of the possible story lines and plot twists because there are just too many to keep up with and I don't want to ruin Quantico for someone else. However, I don't see it making it another season as is. I watched upwards of 10 episodes of season one before giving up. To me, the characters and situations, while somewhat interesting, are completely unrealistic. There is more relationship drama than sleuthing going on (kinda like how Grey's Anatomy has ventured away from plots about the medicine and veered into the drama- fueled relationships of the characters). There are way way way too many flashbacks and forwards (weak storytelling).

These days there are way more shows, better more developed shows, and I only have so much time to invest in watching television.
