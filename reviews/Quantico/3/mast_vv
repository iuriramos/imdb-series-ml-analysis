Totally unrealistic ... It gets very boring in the end.

What they basically show in the series is that it is OK to let a nuke explode in the city but it is more important to save your friends... I can't imagine that the terrorist is able to blackmail the FBI agents by saying that he will kill their friends !! Seriously !!! I thought FBI agents are ready to give up their life to save country ... but it looks the agents are too weak that they can be easily blackmailed and forced to develop a nuke by simply threatening to kill other agents !! - If they do it to save their family or loved ones, it may make sense... but simply to save fellow agents - simply NON SENSE

Seriously... unimaginable...
