Where do I start? I started watching it with high hopes and after 3 episodes rated it 10. After 8th episode I started to get bored with all the far fetched twists and other nonsense the authors were adding. I felt like it was written by someone who had no idea what police are doing, what Quantico is or even how to write a good script. It was like the authors were just trying to squeeze anything they can and stretched what should've been a 10-episode series into 20+ of boring lines, back in forth switches where viewed often finds himself lost and laughable facts. 

Authors managed to blade every single person for what is happening in the show(no spoiles here) It got boring quick. By 12 episode I was seriously bored and quit watching it on the 14th as I couldn't take the low-drag nonsense of boring dialogs and the blame-game which the author took from james bond movies.

I first rated it 10,but switched to 3 later. Very disappointed! That what happens what you drag a show for 24 episodes instead of making an amazing 8-12 episode series. 

Most feel the same way.
