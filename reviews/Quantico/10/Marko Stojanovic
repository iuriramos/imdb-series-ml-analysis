If you like crime series this is the series for you. After the first episode I was not thrilled, but as the series showed excitement grew and tensions and my love for it. With an unusual story and uncharacteristic crime series, with innovative before and after the story will become a series that will hardly wait. Emotions phenomenal actors and awaken emotions in you, the story will simply pass through you, will think for a moment what would you do if it happened to you that you can not trust anyone. As much as wanted to anticipate the sequence of events, and will always be fooled and surprise, not always positive, but this is only because not exactly the way you wanted. Also Joshua Safran has left us to think by next year what will happen in the second season, honestly I did not wait because I know it will be another phenomenal story. I would recommend everyone to look at the series will not repent, actors, story, effects, real action, in short, all the best. And another thing you'll have a lot of problems in the decision who your favorite actress or actor.

Enjoy with the best series and see next season in #Quantico!

Thank you! Bye!
