Great start! This is one casual and dynamic Sunday prime-time show. Easy to watch, great production, cameras and colors. I'm sick of reality wild cameras and gray/green color base in new shows. Also, story is pretty cool, cross before/after time, dynamic. Best new show. Love it! I don't know why people criticize Pryanka's acting. It's not bad at all! She is a very good actor and she will prove herself in US TV series, I'm sure of it! Also, other cast looks great! Like I said before, it's casual show, yeah, it's about crime, FBI and terrorism, but "easy" and interesting. Maybe not series for everyone, but I really don't understand those very negative critics... but, you know, haters gonna hate! :)
