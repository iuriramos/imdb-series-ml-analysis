Quantico is a show which promises to get better with each episode passing by. The twists and the way the incidents are shown are so relevant and talk absolute sense. One of the most gripping shows one can come across. season 1 was amazing. Alex Parish played by megastar Priyanka Chopra is one character you can fall in love with such ease. The other cast members, are bloody good at their job too. You might feel you know them, their thinking process and their attitude, that's how detailed and brilliantly they are been written. season 2 has just begun and has managed to grab even more eyeballs and well make them bigger! Edgy/dark/intense/fascinating/oh-so-hot/ and interesting to say the least. The newbies are so talented that even when you aren't used to seeing them, you fall for them easily. Alex Parish, this character as evolved and how! Priyanka Chopra, is a megastar as I said, and you can see it why. Brilliant. Watch the show, because everybody deserves to see good television..or shall I say art.
