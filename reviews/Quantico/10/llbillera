The constant back and forth between past and present has me a bit confused?? Miranda was stabbed by someone (supposedly her son) and he disappeared. In the finale she is in her office in the FBI on New Year's Eve, the 4 girls are partying in their room and Amin stays to talk to Miranda while the others go to Caleb's party. I got that. I'm guessing this was before the first bomb. But was Miranda stabbed yet? Is her son missing yet?? When Amin and Miranda are talking I believe Amin mentions that the son is missing and Miranda is sleeping in her office, because she is afraid to go home. In the future, the FBI recruits are searching for the 2nd bomb which goes off. They show the bomb and Miranda is there ~ the next minute she is home and finds her son beat up. When did she go home??? Did she suddenly leave while they were searching for the bomb??? Was she home with Charlie when the bomb went off?? Trying to get these time-lines to make sense??? Just how long after the New Year's flash-back and the bomb going off???

LOVE this show, by the way!!!
