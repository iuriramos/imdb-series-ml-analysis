I didn't think I'd even like the show but somehow expected/hoped it would be like or as good as "Pensacola" (about the Air-Force Academy...) was.

To my utter surprise and amazement the pilot far exceeded my expectations. Although I usually hate flashbacks in movies etc, their use here is done very well. I like intricate writing and plot twists and to be shocked by things I've never seen coming and this show delivers them all. My favorite TV show of all time is Battle Star Galactica and then LOST. It was the writing that made those shows great and I can see that kind of talent here. I can only hope the writer(s) can keep it up for the entire season.
