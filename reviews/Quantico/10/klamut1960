I have been watching Quantico since the beginning and have thoroughly enjoyed each episode. It's suspenseful, character-driven and keeps you guessing, with the story shifting between the present day (a shocking terrorist attack and the efforts to find the the suspect) and the past (the training and relationships of a class of recruits at Quantico, each of whom has their own tangled motivations for wanting to be an FBI agent). The flashback technique is very effective and allows the viewer to get to know the characters through the training they undergo and their own individual stories, which are slowly revealed to the viewer in each subsequent episode. 

There appears to be a lot of concern voiced in prior reviews that the show is not "realistic. Well, it's not a documentary, it's a TV show and it's meant to be entertaining, not instructive. If you want to be entertained on a Sunday night, I highly recommend Quantico, one of the best of the new fall shows.
