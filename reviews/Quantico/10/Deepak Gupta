Frankly, 'FBI' does not sell anymore as far as I am concerned. There are tons of cop thrillers out there with a 'mystery unraveling' as a magnet that keeps you hooked to the series. Too clich√©d.

BUT

I was surprised by Quantico. I was skeptical about Priyanka Chopra's blending in with the Hollywood cast. But her performance is really good. Regarding the drama itself, the way it is being presented, with the present and the past interleaved and unraveling at the same time is also nice.

Many series also tend to glorify just the main character while leaving the other characters more of a caricature or just fillers. This one's, thankfully, has not fallen prey to that. There are many characters that are fairly promising to develop into surprises and twists later in the series. This keeps anticipation high. Is Ryan Booth really all that good? What's Simon Asher's game really? Shelby's story sounds too simple to be believed, given the 'trend' the story indicates about the messy past of most other prominent characters. Keep watching to find out :)

Finally, a word on sensibility of pieces of the plot. This isn't meant to blow your mind with consistency of logic behind the actions of Fed's or the Agents as shown in the story. This isn't the Matrix or Inception. But I don't fault it for that since, to me, it's not even it's function to be one. It's supposed to be an entertainer, and as per me, it is doing a decent job of being one! I'll leave it at that! Do give it a shot. I don't think this deserves a 'less than 8' score on IMDb considering many other less deserving series have a higher rating.
