Quantico is definitely one of the best shows that has ever hit the screens of our raw, monotonous television sets. It offers so much more than a great story- The characters (and their flaws), the cast (and their acting) but most of all the Direction! We see the plot-line switching between the past and the present, gracefully bouncing in both the time-frames, connecting dots and revealing secrets. Everyone has something to hide but who actually holds the biggest secret is still a mystery (one that this show teases, caresses and cleverly still holds close to itself). By far the one thing that I demand in any TV show I watch or a book that I may read is the word mentioned multiple times in the above summary... "Plot-Twist". This show is so chock-a-block full of plot-twists that the viewer would be enthralled almost every 10-15 minutes of watching the show (if not earlier). To conclude, I highly recommend everyone to start watching this one if you haven't already. Cheers.
