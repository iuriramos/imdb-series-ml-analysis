I loved this show basically the 3rd episode in which the heat really turns on. The acting skills are pretty good everybody is doing justice to their role.Good to see such a refreshing show airing.A must watch on my list. The twist and turns are very unexpected it really keeps you glued to your seats & always on the edge of your seats. Give the starting episodes a little time to settle in and you will love & enjoy the ups & downs of episodes.The show has everything family angle,intellectual approach & all the stuff falls at its place.The show covers the funny & quirky prospective of FBI recruitment process.I totally loved the the perfection of director.The manner in which he has a clear vision on how he wants the things done.Its really lovely how the show moves angle by angle.It helps you understand how the things are moving. I don't why some people have reviewed so badly as show as per me is a top notch and a real refreshment from the daily shows which are airing.I guess ABC should change the timing of the show.The suspense has started to build & Lets, see what does the other episodes have got in stored.
