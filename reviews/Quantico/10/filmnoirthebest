Well, we all have our opinions and are film critics in our own right! I couldn't believe the bad reviews. I rarely see a drama show that I enjoy each frame as I did Quantico. Usually, it's on Cable networks and not broadcast networks (Boss, Magic City, Ray Donovan, Nurse Jackie, Justified, Suits, breaking Bad)or Netflix (House of Cards). I found this storytelling compelling. It held my interest when it's so easy to turn-off and watch something else. There are loads of new programming to preview or news seasons to enjoy, so enduring a dud isn't an option. The acting and writing was good, maybe, because I know how incompetent so-called pros can be. I love the way the stories are told and the characters are fleshed out. The Chopra actress is beyond gorgeous, a new star on the horizon with a cool, relaxed acting style and chops. I don't expect for television shows not to be over-the-top, they must grab viewers quickly or get kicked to the curb by networks if they don't deliver good ratings. Networks don't give shows time to find their space or develop characters, so there will be imperfections. I hope people keep on watching!!!
