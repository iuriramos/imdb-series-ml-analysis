It's one of the few series I write about, it deserves it. 

The whole season makes you jump from one time-line to another, but in the same process you can see how every character's life is being understood on a past and present focus. It was really clever from the producers. 

I think is one of the most to watch TV series. Also the mix of drama, action, suspense and intrigue all along. It's awesome. 

Recommend it to every thriller-drama-action fan. I now you will enjoy. I don't know how would fit a second season, at least they.. sorry, no spoilers. 

Is a great script, great time-line, some loopholes on the cinematography, and some actors are like not that great, but I know at the last chapter of the season you will enjoy. You will get inside and... I hope you cry as I did, because is really filled with many emotions and at the end, you will not seen it coming. 

Have an awesome day!
