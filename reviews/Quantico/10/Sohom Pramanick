People who were waiting to take down Priyanka Chopra once the pilot was aired, can just take a hike! She is easily one of the best things about the series, if not the best. She is the heart, soul and eyes of Quantico, and she does a damn good job with that. She is pretty, feisty, hugely confident, and her accent isn't exactly fake, for those who want it to be like that! Even her fellow actors are quite decent, with Jake McLaughlin, Yasmine Al Massri and Tate Ellington being the pick of the lot. The pilot episode has many twists and turns that you will be held gasping for breath. Some of the recruits' mysterious backgrounds are quite gripping and interesting. The pilot episode packs so much punches that you will be literally waiting with bated breath for the next week's episode to air.

Priyanka Chopra is perfect TV material. While everybody in the US is raving about her looks, here's what we have to say: PC is definitely much more than just a pretty face. She oozes confidence and wit, and is second to none on the show. Her accent, while Facebook and Twitter trolls would not stop making fun of it, is perfect. She doesn't try to go over the top, rolling her tongue or not finishing words as the Americans usually do. She speaks each syllable of the word and is very easy on Indian ears. Yes, she isn't all Raj Koothrapali (The Big Bang Theory) or Apu Nahasapeemapetilon (The Simpsons), who speak English in an Indian accent that we Indians too have difficulty relating to.

Quantico is definitely a really good thriller and Priyanka Chopra has the right chops to pull of the main character with great ease. But I really hope the makers realize they need to do more than 'good' and something original for the show to sustain for a longer period.
