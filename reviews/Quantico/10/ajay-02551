Thoroughly enjoy seeing Priyanka as an FBI agent. The serial has its fair share of mystery, suspense, action & emotion. Overall every episode keeps you enthralled & wanting more. 

Kudos to Priyanka for making her mark in the international scene. Love her bringing the Indian culture, and of course the ubiquitous AUM bracelet she wears all through the serial, to an international audience. 

Of course there are other serials with similar action and drama like 24, and we have our copyright version of the same with Anil Kapoor. But hope to see more of our talent on international platforms, movies & TV serials.
