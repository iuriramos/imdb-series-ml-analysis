Quantico is one of the gems out there. I haven't seen Grey's Anatomy or rather Homeland. But I don't really care about any comparisons, since I felt the Quantico itself has amazing unequaled plot. I initially had skeptical approach towards the show & kept procrastinating to watch it. But I feel so happy that I finally watched it. From the Pilot episode, this is gripping. Well enough time spent on the character development.

The best thing about the show is its pace. It is fast enough while get you involved in the story (or rather stories) and keep hold of your nerves for the suspense that is maintained throughout. In-fact it is so rapid, that you sometimes get jumbled to keep the pieces together, not to mention it's captivating anyway. Second, the cast is amazing. I'm not being biased because the main protagonist is Priyanka Chopra (an Indian actress), but rather not being her huge fan, I felt in love with her character and others too. My favorite character is Simon AsherÂ…Outstanding! 

Locations are apt and there is so much to learn from the FBI academy, their assignments, their challenges they face while training. I loved that part the most. It's not just for those aspirant FBI agents, but probably will kick enough adrenaline for some to pursue the career as one. It's a thrilling ride and I feel the show is unnecessarily underrated with 7.3 overall rating in here. It deserves much more than that. Anyway, for similar fans out there we are just glad that we'd given a wonderful show to watch across.
