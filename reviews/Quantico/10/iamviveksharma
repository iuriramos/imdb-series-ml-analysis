Pilot is amazing. Keeps you going and wanting for more. Cast diversity is amazing. It really feels good to see new faces on television. Starts with Alex in rubble, and ends with us wanting for the 2nd episode. It is definitely a must watch this fall. The story is pretty impressive. It will definitely hook you up. The only thing is that somehow it is similar to homeland and How to get away with murderer, but its good as it gives you best of all successful shows. Priyanka leads the pack and i m sure this show is going to be a success. Moreover the second episode looks very catchy from its previews. As per analysts this show will do wonders and will be the best prime time show of this season. I don't find any flaw so i m giving this show a 10/10.
