Terrorist Christians attacking a Planned Parenthood facility. Yep, that's right near the top of America's threats. Not Muslim extremists, drug cartels or environmentalist extremists. Nope. Do not want to deal with problems that really exist. Storming a Planned Parenthood aborting viable babies? Politically, if not factually, incorrect.

In another time and another culture, episode 2 of Quantico would be called propaganda. Like most propaganda, it serves to take the viewers eye and mind away from reality and refocus it upon truthless fictions that fits the propagandists ends.

I, for one, am done with watching shows based on ideological fantasies treated as if possible and probable.
