Where to begin. Come one people: surely viewers should be demanding drama a bit more intelligent than this. A class full of prospective FBI agents who seem to have been selected for their dysfunctionality and (naturally) because of their Hollywood looks. They bicker and squabble and lie to each other; they claim to be excellent readers of people and then get taken in all the time; Muslim candidates who, despite covering themselves up always wear nice tight body revealing outfits. Then we have some absurd plot about a candidate who seems to have been groomed within the FBI to be a terrorist patsy. It's all just too dumb for words. The biggest laugh for me is the two women pretending to be the same candidate, somehow getting into the establishment together and living in the same room. Despite the fact that all the other candidates are wandering in and out of each other's room all the time, somehow these two haven't been rumbled by the expert personality readers, at least by episode three, when I decided to whittle a toothpick instead.
