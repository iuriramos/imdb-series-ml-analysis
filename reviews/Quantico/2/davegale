I was hoping this would be similar to "Homeland" or "Madam Secretary" but it gets worse with each episode.

I find myself distracted by the awful script and even worse acting. Sorry guys, but I'd put the blame on the scriptwriters and poor direction. I've squirmed through 14 episodes, hoping a miracle would turn things around, but I can't see it happening. The script and acting is excruciatingly painful.

It's inevitable that this program is doomed to fail. Priyanka Chopra is no Claire Danes.....She's supposed to be the main actor but falls short and lacks credibility. 

Quantico sucks!
