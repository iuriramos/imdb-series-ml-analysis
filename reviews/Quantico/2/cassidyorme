Made the Craziest person LDS in the first episode hahaha you people are idiots.. way to make millions of families turn off and never switch back in the first episode.. families watch TV together and i don't know any religion more family oriented than mormons.. 

if it wasn't for that crap i would have stopped watching for other reasons.. the writing is garbage, its obvious the thought they could create a show behind a pretty face.. no structure.. they throw you into the past and present without any finesse.. one of the guys is shot and killed in the first episode and i couldn't care less.. thats what happens when you don't develop your characters.. i don't even care if the main girl gets caught or escapes... the show gave me nothing to care about with her.. other than i want to sleep with her.. but maybe thats the audience they are going after
