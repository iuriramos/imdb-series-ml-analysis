This show had so much potential, SO MUCH. It's so annoying I can go on and on but will simply outline the MAJOR flaws point form, in order of annoyance.

1) Priyanka - tone it down already!

- Perfect hair and luscious lips after training (and every time the camera is on her)? - tight shirts with undone buttons? (as if this would be allowed in the FBI) - revealing tights? Is this a teen show about summer camp?

- tone down the dramatics already, we get it.

Seriously people? It gets worse as the series progresses. Is this a show about seduction or drama? It's like I'm watching a beauty pageant. Don't get me wrong, she's hot in her own way but all this 'look at me' attention pointing at her is taking away from the story line. Sure, have some sexual tension every now and then but I just can't take her character serious at all. I want to see her get dirty, WORK her way up the FBI ranks, not get in by your fabulous hair. She's just the wrong character for this show.

2) In general:

- this back and forth past/current scenes is the most annoying of any TV show. It's boring and makes me lose interest in the current episode as it goes back and forth so much and not much is revealed, and whatever is, is mainly insignificant or confusing.

- since when do trainees talk back and disrespect their superiors? This is so pathetic, this may as well be how it goes down in Girl Scout camps.. little spoiled brats talking back to their camp counsellors. 

What gets me the most about this show is that is really had SO MUCH potential as being something new and fresh... we've seen enough of wolves, zombies, hospital dramas, cop shows etc. I was hoping this would be as good or at least closer to How To Get Away with Murder, the best newest concept in a long time or the still strong Blue Bloods which has realism in every aspect of the show. But sadly, all we have here is a teen level interest wannabee drama with sad realism and characters that are stale and boring.
