Where do I begin... This show is so outlandish and unbelievable! It should be labeled as pure fantasy. The first episode is mediocre and just nose dives from there. the plot is ridiculous. I cannot suspend enough disbelief to think even for a second that these idiots fresh out of Quantico are the best agents the FBI can throw at a major terrorism investigation! And i know Priyanka is getting high praise for her acting, but i find her to be over the top. I'm not sure how much of that is her fault or the result of having to work with a terrible script. This show insults your intelligence at least once during each segment. Lots of pretty people acting badly in not-so-believable scenarios.
