I am an Indian who lives in India, so don't tell me that I hate this series because I am an bigot. This show and the protagonists acting sucks its plain simple as that .

I would definitely agree that Priyanka Chopra is a gorgeous girl but she lacks talent in acting (also as an English singer :)). Most actresses in bollywood became famous because of their beauty and not because of their talent. Bollywood (not Indian films) as a whole is a talent less industry with very few good actors,actress,story or directors. Except some veteran actors like nasrueddein shah, om puri, amrish puri etc most of the other actors who tried their luck with English films lacks talent. The one thing which I have seen in such actors are they tend to over act (Bollywood mode) or do emotionless acting (Zombie mode). Examples are Aishwarya rai(Pink Panther2) Imran khan (Jurassic world). Similarly in this series in some part she follows a bollywood mode then the other zombie mode. While her counter parts acting looks natural her acting looks odd.

One Indian to other, PC (or other bollywood "talents" ) if you are reading this review then please improve your skills.

For those who doesn't know Indian films. Bollywood is one of many film industry in India. Bollywood doesn't mean Indian Films
