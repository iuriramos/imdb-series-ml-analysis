Disjointed, unconnected, illogical and unbelievable. 

Against my better judgment I decided to give this program a try. The previews were an indication of what was to come. Too many "pretty and perfect recruits" and the one who isn't they had to make gay! The story line is completely unbelievable, full of holes and is almost as asinine as day time soap operas. 

Very, very disappointed in this program. Gave it a try for three episodes and just cannot stomach it any more. Back to reruns for me rather than watch any more.

Pity any young actor thinking they had received their big break signing up for this turkey.
