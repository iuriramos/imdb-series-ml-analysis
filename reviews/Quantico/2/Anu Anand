Most shows have great lead actors and so-so supporting roles.

This one has picked great supporting actors, and a so-so lead.

Plus, the story happens to somehow annoy the viewer.

Its interesting,but you never feel engaged in what's going on.

Maybe its the changing pace, or that it goes from obvious to confusing, as if someone was using textbook guidelines while writing it.

Maybe it'll get better, the story that is.

Lead's acting is way better than that of most Indian actors.

But, I doubt it can improve quickly enough to the standards of her Quantico peers.

Maybe they should make the hot one in the show, the lead's rival in love, the lead, in a comic book sort of an alternate universe, hehe.

I get the feeling that they picked the lead just so they could get target the Indian audience. Its a pity they had to alienate the American one.
