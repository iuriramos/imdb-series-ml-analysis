Quantico initially came with a Big Bang and now is turning out to be really boring and lost! 

The series caught attention with Alex Perish (Priyanka Chopra) being starred as the lead character of the show thereby pulling in all the "Indian" crowd to glue their eyes on television sets during the Prime Time! However, the script is so poor and boring that its a big lackluster even for the Indian folks! 

What drew attention then ? - 9/11 sort of terrorist attacks - Priyanka Chopra - She being the main suspect - The FBI training academy - Priyanka Chopra's NSA encounters 

What went wrong ? - The story is very confusing and dragging - Its like a Hindi soap, but just that it is in English - There is absolutely no thrill in watching it - Having a 2nd Season and introducing another set of morons was the biggest mistake - No clear script, its like the writer is just dragging on and on and ON - Biggest Flaw -- You show one person as bad at the end of the episode and in the next one they show as that person being good. The trick works once but repeating it again and again is BORING

What's next ? I don't know.. I won't be surprised if it is Alex Perish who is really behind all this! I won't be surprised! WHY ? Because all BAD guys turn out GOOD so all GOOD guys should turn out BAD.
