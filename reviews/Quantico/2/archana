2/10 because they have some good actors in there.

Please fire the script writer and the research team. It undermines the intelligence of the organization that they portray. 

And its become quite boring at this point. I am surprised it got another season into production.

They seem to know how to drag it on and on. Make episodes for the sake of them. It stopped being a thriller lot time ago. And is it more of a drama series ? It fails at that too.

I will not be watching the next season. Now that its not Netflix, I gave it another shot at continuing the ones I left off. But its quite unbearable even if its available on demand.
