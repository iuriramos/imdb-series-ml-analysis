I was hopeful to this show since it allowed us a view into FBI's training facilities and how it is done. Big is my surprise when they start jumping forward and backward in time. Didn't the producers see how the show "The nine" failed to be a hit? The acting varies from bad to extreme bad, but what can you expect when the script is lousy. The plot are like a swiss cheese - full of holes. I really hate it when you have to make the actors really stupid for making some progress in the story

I gave the show three episodes and have landed on the character two since the women in the show are quite beautiful - stay away.
