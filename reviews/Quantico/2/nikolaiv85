All students have great security issues. No-one of them can be in Quantico. A bomb threat-solved without Geiger counter,and without radiation leaks,or any other major problems with that kind of weapon(yeah,someone listened physics classes). The most obvious bad guy is not suspect until the end of first season. No-one understand senator's personal motives for killing FBI agents,until the end. People get and lost badges from episode to episode. Today they are friends,tomorrow enemies.They trust more to strangers than to friends,and their friend can prove so many times,they will doubt him/her. Their behavior is like they are in high school,not in some serious institution.Maybe is better to say-something like American pie without Steve Stifler (but there is a guy who looks like him),and with girls' main problem(in this show)-how get laid without consequences(read responsibilities), but with perks(Alex and Shelby,but they both,of course, fail). Writers tried to make interesting show,they had great idea,but they are lost in mixture between The Blacklist and Sex and city. There is much room for improvement,we will see,maybe one day...
