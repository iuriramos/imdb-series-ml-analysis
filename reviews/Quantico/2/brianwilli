The plot is incredibly forced and the characters feel like the result of a college campus focus group.

A perfectly diverse group of FBI recruits come together for training. Each embodies their pop culture stereotype to a tee. In their first week, they're tasked with finding a secret about a classmate. Shockingly each candidate has made a secret trip to the middle east or killed someone. 

Before the end of the episode both religious characters are shown to be too good to be true, the big-mouthed show- off shows his heart of gold and the gay guy proves to be an ultra- insightful niceguy.

Then something vaguely catastrophic happens. The main suspect is surprisingly rescued at the last moment for overly ambiguous reasons. Oh, and shocker, one of the recruits is working a shady covert operation.

It's Glee in the FBI.
