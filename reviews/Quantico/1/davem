This is a story with no story. In this crime drama, every single character is a suspect at one point or another, until only one character is left. So, by the process of elimination, this is the real culprit.

Few more low points - of the batch of what is considered to be the brightest recruits, one of them is being conned by a "Nigerian prince" style con artist. Seriously? You call these sorry asses the best of the best, and one of them is being conned by the oldest con known in the modern times?

One high point - you can actually watch the entire season in 3 hours. Just keep fast forwarding - you wont miss anything. If you only watch the fist 5 minutes and last 5 minutes of every episode, its actually not that bad.
