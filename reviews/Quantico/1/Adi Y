One more idea bites the dust due to awful casting and poor writing. It definitely had the potential to be an interesting show, but just the idea cannot save the show. Writing and acting must work/go together to bring the idea to life and mesmerize the audience. Acting is just awful.

Speaking of awful acting, it reminds me of the lead lady. Her name is Priyanka Chopra and acting has always been her dream, and unfortunately it still remains just that... a "dream!". I have been watching her for almost 10 years now; she and "acting" have never been in a same room together... ever! Let me put it this way - if I were to draw a Venn Diagram of her skills and acting as a skill then they would be disjoint and as far apart as The Milky way and The Andromeda galaxies. The cheesy bollywood casts anyone with a tiara from a beauty pageant and that's how she came to the film industry. I hope she takes some acting classes and puts some effort to improve her acting. She should try saving the show first, let alone saving the country. She should watch "Carrie Mathison"; might learn a few things about acting...!

The theme of the show is a mix of "Bourne" series and "The Recruit". I don't think any one is tired of those ideas or ever will be. But, definitely, the execution matters the most to keep people interested where Quantico fails miserably for the main 2 reasons I mentioned earlier. I hope the focus changes to a different character in the show and writing improves or I don't see it going past the 1st season...
