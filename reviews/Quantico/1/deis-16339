I was looking forward to a good show about FBI life and drama. This was not it. I am amazed that the lead actress landed this role. She demonstrates very poor acting skills and is unbelievable as any sort of law enforcement officer. In fact I found that I could not connect with any of the characters or contrived story lines. The suspense was non- existent. 

It feels like a strong political agenda has terrorized the shows chance at success. Who knows, maybe it will become a popular show but I am checking out after the first episode. If you stay to watch longer, grab your pillow and blanket.
