Potentially strong show--but I won't be watching it anymore. It sickens me that ABC is so comfortable portraying the traditional antisemitic characterizations of the one Jewish character---weak, scrawny, betrays his colleagues, lies while the Muslim characters are of course perfect in every way. Oh, and then there is the fact that he was in the IDF and "did horrible things he can't live with" 

Is there anything in the only Jewish character that doesn't encompass every lie and antisemitic and anti Israel stereotype in history?

ABC's news coverage of the knife terror committed by Palestinian teenage terrorist against innocent civilian Israeli babies and children is so twisted that I don't know why I'm surprised their actual fiction portrays Jews/Israelis with such venom. You lost this viewer, and i intend to make sure you lose many more along with sponsors. STOP THE ANTISEMITISM and ANTIZIONISM you cowards.
