Yet another series I'll not be able to continue to watch. I couldn't even get through the first ten minutes without being accosted by two guys kissing! I don't claim any moral high ground on this, but it's not something I feel comfortable viewing. The liberals who create these shows would have you believe that this is "normal" but most of us comprehend basic concepts such as "tab A fits slot B." Shoving this in your face is an inappropriate mechanism for encouraging acceptance. Doesn't work for me. Perhaps others will overlook this and ratings will soar. If so then I'm obviously part of the "moral minority." It seemed to hold some promise, although there were also some overt hints at the likely guilty party in the preliminary scenes. So good luck with this one; I know that I won't be watching.
