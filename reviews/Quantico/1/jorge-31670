This was awful dammit . Plot is weak , actors and actresses are weak. Wth the lead actress is easy on the eyes but you can tell has had more plastic surgery than acting classes .. when did fake looks take the place of real talent , damn I was hoping for a good story or at least good acting . There is neither here to be had . If you haven't seen it and have any sort of good taste or IQ you wont like it ... 

I am surprised since I was under the impression that the woman who wrote how to get away with murder wrote this too, so I thought for sure this would be quick and brilliant like "How to get away with"... but nope this was slow and simple .
