I haven't seen an actress that acts as bad as Priyanka Chopra since the last time I watched Rocky Horror Picture Show, I don't find her to be in the least a creditable FBI agent, more like a Charmin Toilet Tissue spokeswoman, I'm surprised anyone hired her. And like the rest of the networks out there of course they had to throw lesbian and gay people in it hoping to draw that percentage into their viewing audience, I find that it is pathetic, the percentage of the LGBT people out there can not make much of a difference to the viewing ratings, so on that point alone I wont watch this show anymore. I find the plot of the show very thin, and absolutely none of the actors or actresses any good at their trade, they should have stayed at McDonalds flipping burgers. If you want to watch something more entertaining, watch your laundry spin.
