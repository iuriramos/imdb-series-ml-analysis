That's about the only "strength" the show has. It is a perfect example that everyone has to start somewhere, except it looks like the actors in the show are exactly where they should and can be. Worst acting you will ever see, Josh Hopkins on occasion does this face that says "why did I ever agree to do this."

On the other hand the script is so bad, no wonder actors are doing such a bad job, with a cheesy, forced, totally unrealistic story-line there's only so much you can do. And I don't have the slightest idea what an FBI academy would be like, but the only vibe you get from the show is fake and ridiculous. The dialogues are a complete disaster. Who writes this things? And, more importantly who green-lights a show like this one?
