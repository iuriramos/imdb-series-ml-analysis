I will NOT be watching this show. More brainwashing by liberals making muslims out to be good peaceful people that don't want to kill Americans like their Koran commands them to. It get old... get shows back to how they used to be... focusing on a good plot with pushing some agenda and trying to make people think a certain way. Show like this are dangerous... making light of the Muslim invasion here in the US and the the fact that most US mosques contain terrorist cells. Two were raided by the FYI just this last week and they found huge weapons stashes. In the mean time, TV networks are more concerned about offending real Americans with classics like Dukes of Hazzard! The irony is despicable!
