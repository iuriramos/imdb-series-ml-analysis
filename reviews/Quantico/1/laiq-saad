Priyanka Chopra's acting was awful in the scene when he was arrested and handcuffed. Her facial & vocal expressions was not of a seasoned actress. She might be having difficulty because of language. I believe she is the worst choice for this role. Plot of the show seems to be interesting and starts from the beginning the suspense is there. I suggest that apart from the Priyanka Chopra's acting you should give it a try. Quantico will definitely be a really good thriller but Priyanka Chopra doesn't have the right chops to pull of the main character with great ease. I really hope the makers realize they need to do more than 'good' and something original for the show to sustain for a longer period.
