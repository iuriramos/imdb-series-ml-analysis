Quantico is a effort to gain popularity through a mid-performer Indian actress.By the view of just the first episode for 1st season(my last for the series), i was sure that it is not going anywhere specially for the second season,but it happen.Yestarday,don't know why but I checked and thought I might have something new to offer in second season but the misery for the viewers continuous.Ms. Chopra try her hard to convince us that she is the part of Hollywood but Nope,it is a long and a hard journey ac-cross. A per the show the story is bad,don't know the flow,fixed on certain character,irrespective how bad they act.Quantico is not a show to go for.
