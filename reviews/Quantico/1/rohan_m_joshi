It is one of the most ridiculous shows on TV. So many in-explainable plots and "fiction". The worst part is the Priyanka Chopra, the lead of the series. Since she is despised in Bollywood, she is trying to make it here. I hate her fake accent (did not try hard enough with the dialect coach). Poor acting. She is trying really hard to act like a American which she is not. She is an Indian and she should be proud of that. Its wrong when immigrants start looking at their home country in contempt. Sometimes I feel she is overacting. The plot does not require her over reaction most of the times. The others in the academy seem so much more normal than her. The director should have caught this before the final edit.
