Quantico,Horrible. From a law enforcement viewpoint, this program should come with a disclaimer, " nothing you are about to view is based in reality, thankfully". Lets start with the rifle range. Camera is showing a number of recruits firing AR15's, behind the firing line, all good, then you have one recruit talking on a cell phone, with the AR15's ( they are loud, no way someone is on a cell phone) in the background, and this guy is wondering all over the range, in FRONT of the firing line. Real life, he would have never made it to that point, range master would have jerked this guy off the line, sent home never to return. Then you have everyone turning in all of their firearms, but one cadet. He decides to keep his firearm and not take the red one he is supposed to carry. So we are to believe the range master never notices ONE red firearm that was never picked up. Are you kidding me. Then this guy takes a loaded firearm into the interview room, kills one person, and eventually kills himself, really???. In real life, a complete background and polygraph is done way before the agency wastes a dime on these applicants. His "secret" would have been found out very early because they ask you one very important question, "have you ever knowingly committed a felony?" . Do you really think he could have lied his way through this question? Bottom line, good idea, horrible program, or at least, the worst technical adviser every used. There is more, but don't have the space or time.
