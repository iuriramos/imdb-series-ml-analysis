The first 5 minutes were OK - some intrigue, some guessing, but it really didn't take long to frame this as a weak waste of time. Everyone is a suspect? Really? The set up for this was so poor, that it was scary. By the way - 10 lines for a review is a terrible idea. The jumping forward and backward in time 9 months and so many characters roles have changed is too much to deal with. And the escape? total BS.... This is another example of weak TV - no wonder people rave about a science teacher making meth or a mass murderer working for the police - this story is garbage. I for one, won't waste another second on it - it was, as my vote says - awful.
