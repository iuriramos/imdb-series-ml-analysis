This is the worst series I have ever seen, so bad that I'm writing a review for the first time.

The concept is good, unfortunately it doesn't follow it's synopsis. Instead every episode is focused around showing how brutish and incompetent all white people are and how especially untrustworthy gay people are.

This is always 'balanced' by showing off what the hero's the Indian and Muslim women are. They are the only ones who can figure out *any* of the plots despite the white people holding them back, they have all overcome so much while again the white people are all broken from their struggles and that the Indian girl is the only person capable of forgiving a grudge and being pragmatic.

And to finally top it off there are other stereotypes thrown in for good measure - most notable the 'Black Woman' (who refers to herself as this more than once) who is constantly being sassy and unprofessional and who makes a poor effort at depicting feminism with some choice clich√©d quotes like "That is something only a man would say"

Do not waste your time on this show
