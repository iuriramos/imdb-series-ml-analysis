Two people kissing really doesn't add much to the show...much less two men passionately, really, really passionately kissing! Hollywood just has to have gay issues in every show...I know, that's liberal Hollywood. It's disgusting. It is when I channeled the television and vowed not to view it again - Not only are you pandering for ratings but you are soliciting to a narrow group of viewers. What happened to just having a great show, without those issues, that can be watched as a family on a Sunday night? This is not a homophobe issue. It could be too much cussing or too much nudity - let's bring back some great shows, with great story lines that are interesting and entertaining! FYI Neuroscientists can predict with 95% accuracy if someone is conservative or liberal showing disgusting pictures to someone in an MRI. The more uncomfortable a person is the more conservative they are! http://www.pbs.org/the-brain-with-David-eagleman/about/ It seems as though this program has an agenda. It would be great if the network would cater to a broader spectrum of viewers, not just the liberal Hollywood elites.
