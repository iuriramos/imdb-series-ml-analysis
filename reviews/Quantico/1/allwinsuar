It is deeply disturbing and frightening that ABC's muddled terrorism- soap-opera series, "Quantico," has continued to escalate its blatant, vicious defamation of Jews, Israel and the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), promoting ugly lies against the Jewish people and the Jewish State. ( About Quantico's defamatory Episodes 4 and 5, which discussed, for instance, how Quantico falsely claimed in Episode 4 that Israel bombed the Gaza greenhouses, when, in fact, Israel gave these multi-million dollar greenhouses to Gaza's Arabs, and Palestinian Arabs looted and destroyed the greenhouses.

"Quantico" also escalated its practice of mocking and portraying Jews as sniveling, untrustworthy, duplicitous, disloyal, war criminals, violent, unable to see the "greater good," people who "follow orders" that are wrong; terrorism-plotters and ugly bomb-makers. "Quantico" also makes absurd "Islamaphobia" claims; portrays Muslims as moral and beautiful; glorifies a Muslim Imam who defies the FBI; and glorifies Arab terrorists and Palestinian-Arab "resistance" (a euphemism for Palestinian-Arab attacks on Jews). It's time for ABC to cancel this horrendous, defamatory series, which reverses reality. Jews are already being subjected to far more religious hate crimes than any other group: Sixty-percent (60%) of U.S. religious hate crimes are against Jews (and only 15% are against Muslims). "Quantico" will inflame more baseless Jew hatred and incite even more anti-Semitic hate crimes.
