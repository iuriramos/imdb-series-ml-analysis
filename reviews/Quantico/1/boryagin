A nice fresh plot with an insider look at FBI academy at Quantico. At first, it's just a bit unsettling that the only apparently Jewish guy pretends being gay. Then some BS about IDF committing crimes in Gaza but you still dismiss it due to possible ignorance on the part of the authors.

But then the story becomes an actual distorted propaganda as the same fake gay Jewish guy speaking fluent Hebrew connects to a religious Jewish friend who is also a bomb maker.

So we have apparent lies about IDF crimes in Gaza. Sounds familiar, ha? Then two Muslim girls, Quantico students, who are as innocent as kittens. Nothing wrong with that, as long as Jews are not the devil. Then the same only Jewish student at Quantico is revealed as a terrorist who killed 120 people in the heart of New York.

Another piece was a guy, who used to play Israelis in other shows, here becomes a sadistic torturer for the government.

It was disappointing to stop watching this show. I could not just go with this obvious anti-Israeli and antisemitic propaganda and continue enjoying the show.
