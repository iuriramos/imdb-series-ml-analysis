Simply put I had to pull the plug on the horror show after only 10 episodes. Any promise this show has is totally ruined by abysmal writing and completely unnecessary teen Puppy Love Storyline. Seriously, is this show aimed at an ADULT audience? Is is supposed to be about FBI and The FBI Academy)Beats me, as every 5 minutes is "Oh Ryan" or "Oh Alex" wtf??? Even Caleb and Shelby's "affair" was more credible but even that was too much!

After 10 episodes I ain't hanging around for any more torture. Goodbye to both of them... Good Riddance to both!

TV has become so riddled with Teen Shows that it's too constipated to watch anymore. Unless of course you're watching a JJ Abrams or Alex Kurtzman offering like Fringe for example. In the past 10 years only Fringe, Breaking Bad or Orphan Black have been Great. In fringe, even the Peter/Olivia thing took 5 seasons to play out...not every 5 minutes!!!" Badly needs credible Writers and actors and story lines that keep one interested!
