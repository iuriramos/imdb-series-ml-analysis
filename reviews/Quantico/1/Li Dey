Do not waste your time, this show is just awful!!! 

The script is poorly written, the main actress has a forced accent and she's a horrible actress. Really really bad acting skills! I could barely understand what she was saying, had to turn on the captions for this one. I was expecting more out of this law enforcement/Fbi type show. It's basically a show about a terrorist attack with some brown characters. Hmmmn...sounds like a million other shows/movies out there?

After the first 10 minutes of the show, you could tell this was going downhill. I won't add any spoilers so watch if you must. 

How is this even on abc?! I watch a lot of abc shows and this one doesn't stand up to the rest.
