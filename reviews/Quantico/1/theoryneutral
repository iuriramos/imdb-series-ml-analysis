This series is a parody of itself. The 'strong' female lead cries every episode and whines constantly. It's as though the Grey's Anatomy writers did too many drugs, got together while stoned and wrote a bad comedy. 

So they took Grey's Anatomy romantic drama, music and pacing, coupled it with and the concept of the FBI, added some exceptionally bad acting and hot actors, and made a series that essentially shames the real FBI.

It also shames Grey's anatomy, so that this plays like a SNL skit of Grey's Anatomy. It's perhaps the worst and most amateurish series I've seen in the past 20 years.

Save yourself the pain.
