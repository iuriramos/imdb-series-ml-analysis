Being a first generation Indian-American, I watched this show against a few better choices. I won't lie - We were prejudiced. We were rooting for Chopra to succeed on this international platform. While I try not to write negative reviews, this one merits one.

First, the underdog premise. The story is about an FBI agent who must fight to get her name cleansed. I dig that. But, that story starts to fail before even it could get started. Forget about empathizing with the protag. I wouldn't have cared if Chopra's character was hit by a bus.

Second, the characters. Razor thin. Comical at best. If this represents our FBI, we are doomed.

Third, dialogue. Terrible. There is nothing clever about it. No subtext. Wish author would've taken some lessons from "The Homeland". Enough said.

Finally, the acting. Is there any?

All and all, this show reminded me on 90210. Plastic characters trying hard to deliver on a non-existent story.
