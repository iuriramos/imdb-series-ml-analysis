This show is so blatantly stupid and repulsive and awful on so many levels it defies comprehension. Combine Victoria Secret with Homeland and you have Quantico. And it's pathetic how they forcibly try to make it PC and multicultural by inserting token characters based on race, sexual orientation, religion etc. Yeah, nice job straight white male writers and producers and directors. And at the end of the show, after every imaginable orifice has been exploited from the female leads, we can only sit back and bask in masturbatory glory at the cultural Frankenstein created by none other than ABC, who desperately wishes it was AMC. This show made me hate America a little more tonight.
