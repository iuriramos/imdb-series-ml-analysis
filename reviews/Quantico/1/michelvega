I liked the first episode for about 5 minutes. Then it went to commercials and while waiting, I asked myself: WHERE ARE ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS COMING FROM? Did the FBI raid the Playboy mansion to recruit them? And the guys are good looks too. Yeah! Real stuff! Once I realized this, it was all over for me. At first, it reminded me a little of the first episode of Covert Affairs, but it worked in this series because Piper Perabo was the gorgeous girl and the others were mostly good looking normal. But in this show, this Quantico class is far too classy to be realistic. Beauty is no guaranty for intelligence and character. Conclusion: this show is all show and no go, so class dismissed.
