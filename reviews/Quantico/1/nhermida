I actually was excited when I started watching this show. Now, after really trying to like it and follow it for 18 and a half episodes, I stopped watching. I could no longer get through an entire show--hence the half program watched last. 

To many twists. Feels illogical and way too far fetched. No resolution for anything. Acting just OK. It pretty much was making me dizzy with going back and forth between past and present.

This show seems to be written by people with attention deficit disorder, and I've even got the feeling they did not have an idea of the entire story line, making it up as they went along. 

Invested too much time hoping it would get better. No more.
