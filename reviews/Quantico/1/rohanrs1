Priyanka Chopra, a Bollywood star, stars as Alex Parrish, an ambitious FBI recruit who, after becoming the prime suspect in a major terrorist attack in New York City. She must figure out which of her classmates was actually responsible. Quantico shifts between the present, with Alex on the run from authorities. And her memories of training with her fellow recruits.

It's an Awful show. Not worth wasting your time. Priyanka Chopra's acting ??? and her accent ??? God has saved me from watching the second episode. It is Predictable. It is boring. It is slow. And god knows what not. Not on my list anymore. Total waste of time.
