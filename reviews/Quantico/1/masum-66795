Below average plot with awful acting. Too many character . plot line is flawed. This TV show just don't make sense. Main charterer look pretty . But acting is mediocre. Not going to watch next episode . Waste of time . Script is bellow bellow average. Now day production company try to attract viewers with nice trailer / Promo . I guess they spend more money and brain on promo instead of better plot and actor . But It will get good review and market/revenue from Indian viewer. I search in web about main character and find out that already her country's media is very happy about this show's plot & acting . This show is in national news paper headline and Lead TV news. So my guess its success is depend on target market or audience.
