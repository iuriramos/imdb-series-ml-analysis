First time in 10 years that I've been using IMDb I feel the urge to leave a comment. I registered specifically to do so. Pathetic play, pathetic plot, pathetic everything. This lead character is the worst. The plot is bloody awful. Do they really want us to believe that this kind of dialogs, let alone actions, really happens anywhere in the world? 

There's a bomb, a bunch of FBI professionals conspire against FBI to help FBI find them. When a fresh-out-of-whatever-quantico-is (half-year taining, that's all FNI requires, really???) asks questions about undercover operations, another agent, 20 years in service, suddenly tells her everything. He tells it so many times that it's time to go to tribunal for that but not, everyone - aware of the situation - starts feeling for him and helping him deal with it...

How much of this bullshit can they possibly shove down the audience throat??? And it looks like there's another bullshit season is coming later this year. And all those terrible characters will keep wearing their guns in the office, shake their asses like they're in a strip club, share national security operations at first request, and then cover each other even when it comes to a nuclear bomb? Really?
