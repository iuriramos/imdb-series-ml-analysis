--I'm writing this review after seeing 4 episodes--

This is a soap opera about some young recruits/students at the FBI Academy in Quantico. It strongly reminds me of "Fame". Especially after the end of the 4th episode where Aunjanue Ellis (who shares a strong resemblance with Debbie Allen in this. Mannerism, way of speaking, even haircut) gives a "You want Fame? Well fame costs!" speech for her students.

NO ONE of the recruits is who it seems. (So here goes the 1st part of realism). For instance one of them is an agent already in an undercover mission. Another one is actually ...twins (!) in another (different) undercover mission. A gay guy wearing glasses is ...not gay and doesn't need glasses. And so on. Everyone has a secret agenda. No one is a regular college graduate who wanted to join the FBI.

Also anyone has very serious psychological problems (one of them committed suicide in front of the others first day at the school) including teachers. I guess that's why FBI sucks! Anyway. IT IS a TV show, but you have to have a very strong suspension of disbelief to swallow this one.

The series is presented with continuous intercuts, between the weeks at Quantico and a 9/11 event that takes place 6 months afterwards. 3 minutes the one "plot" arc 3 minutes the other. It tries to mislead you many times and ends up with the usual cliffhanger/surprise at the end of the episode BUT the plot is pretty straight forward.

To tell you the truth it is pretty similar with the current episodes of The Blacklist where Agent Keen is considered public enemy nbr.1 and runs as fugitive while the whole FBI force hunts her.

Is it worth watching? Well. There are many questions, but you don't actually feel any mystery, and the dialogs are soap opera boring. IMO watch Blindspot instead.
