they bounce back and fourth in time lines and don't make allot of sense when they do.stick to one story so people can follow it.and what is with all the sex? is there anyone on this show that is not screwing a coworker .are they all perverted nyphs?I thought the show was about becoming a government agent know it is all about being a sex addict.get on with the story already quit jumping from time line to time line and knock off who is having sex with who.not every good series is about sex or how good looking you are it is about the story ,the plot ,the theme.this show is lacking in all areas.just get them all naked and put the show on the porn channel and get it over with.the first season wasn't bad the second just sucks.it is played out like a bad sequel
