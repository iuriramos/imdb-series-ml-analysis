What promised to be a interesting insight into FBI training, quickly devolved into predictable PC fiction and typecasting. The story of a trainee falsely accused of terrorism and subsequently responsible for finding the truth is a pitifully thin attempt to convince the public that the real FBI are a bunch of incompetent boobs.

I cannot believe that anyone really believes real agents are this clueless and in love with juvenile drama!

A reviewer called this a Saved By the Bell knock off ... I think that is giving the writers of this show way too much credit!

What a complete waste of time!
