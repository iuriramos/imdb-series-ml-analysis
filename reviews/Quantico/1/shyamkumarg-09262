This is one of the boring shows ever on the TV. Priyanka Chopra has a horrible fake accent. How did she even get the audition in the first place? Indians born & brought up in India have own English accent. There's nothing to be ashamed of. Indians born in the US like me have accent just like any other American. But this lady fakes her accent & I cannot hear it.She should try to be original like Kunal Nayyar from the Big Bang Theory. Her acting skills are poor. I wonder how this show is still on air.Mindy Kayling,Aziz Ansari,Rahul Kohli all are doing great. Cancel it with immediate effect so that producers can save some money. ABC should replace this show.
