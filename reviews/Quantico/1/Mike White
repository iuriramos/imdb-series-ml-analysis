I have to admit right up front that I did not attend the FBI Academy. But I did graduate from one of the the top 3 U.S. military service academies, serve some combat time, plus later go through some LEO training.

I cannot imagine that these undisciplined and dysfunctional recruits would ever have been accepted into training, much less have survived beyond the first week of the FBI Academy. No effective background and selection checks, no self discipline or self control of the recruits themselves, no demanded respect for authority whatsoever in training, no competence in the leadership of the FBI Academy, no structured FBI Academy curriculum structure, a ridiculous reliance on semi-trained cadets who somehow know more than their highly experienced trainers and then take over a real-world terrorist attack that crops up halfway through training with their somehow superior innate skills, and on and on, and on.

It is not subtlety presented that racial, religious, and sexual diversity within the FBI training class trumps any other qualification- or achievement-based acceptance criteria. The burka-wearing virgin woman, the main Arab-type female protagonist, and the gay guy are among the best recruits, whereas the Mormon white guy is a traitor. Go figure.

And even some of the recruits manage to magically and randomly meet on their way to training and hump themselves to sweaty distraction, only to find later that they are in the same Academy class and have to confront their escapist car sex encounter.

Only Millennials without any mature parental advisement would ever buy into this totally unrealistic soap opera. It's a chick flick for those ladies among us who don't know any better.

I find it hard to believe that any adults in charge of FBI recruitment would ever sanction such a blatantly unrealistic and disrespectful TV portrayal of our competent and brave federal agents.
