The show is quite enjoyable until the end of the second episode where the dumbest plot in the history of modern television appears before your eyes! Basically, this makes the show unwatchable going forward granted that you have a minimum of two functioning neurons.

Spoiler Alert (end of S01E02):

Alex, the FBI recruit/terrorist calls Ryan (the FBI agent she supposedly shot) who tells her he knows she didn't shot him. He offers to help her by GUESS WHAT... telling the FBI that she did shot him and that she is guilty. A completely useless manhunt for Alex ensues instead of an investigation (that Alex will need to conduct herself while escaping every law enforcement agent in the country). Ryan's way of helping moved me so much that i couldn't watch the show any longer :)
