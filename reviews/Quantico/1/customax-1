IMDb User Rating is broken, unless a show or a movies scores 9-10 or 1-2 the rating is not telling you much.

This show is "The Bold and the Beautiful" with a high school cast trying to be an action/drama. Lets hope it will not last as long, "The Bold and the Beautiful" has a rating of 3.5 and are soon in its 3800 episode! I think this show's goal is to showcase and try to sell makeup for both men and women. Cast have not been picked for their acting skills and the dialog is et best "bad". Trendy MTV style clipping and mixing adds to the frustration of this show.

I forced myself through 3 episodes to see if the show improved at all, t was a waste of time. 

In the movie "Starship troopers" they pick similar kind of cast, good looking soap actors as a joke and it works. In Quantico they are serious and they fail badly, none of the leading actors are credible as FBI Agents.

If your goal is to look at 1-2 pretty women, paint a wall and hang photos av the ones like. Take in their beauty while the paint drys, this will give you better entertainment value than watching Quantico!
