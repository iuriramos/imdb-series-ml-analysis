I know Jake McLaughlin from Believe and Josh Hopkins from Cougar Town. the entire cast except Alex (Priyanka Chopra) is good. Had watched a couple of Hindu movies of Priyanka Chopra 7 years ago. Like every Bollywood actor, Chopra has no acting skills. I wonder how she made to the US!! Was really excited to see her anyway on American Television but she is the only disappointment on the show. Claire Danes did justice to her role on Homeland. There are similarities between Homeland & Quantico but Homeland turned out to be the Winner obviously because of Carrie Mathinson. The producers of Quantico should consider replacing lead role with someone else. I feel that this show is going to be canceled anyways.
