While I agree there are some plot holes (such as the recruit not returning his gun), the one people are harping on the most IS NOT a plot hole:

The FBI is aware of the twin Muslim women. When Simon knocks on the door to invite them to coffee, she asks who it is and he responds, "I should ask you. Is it Nima or Mina...I'll take either one."

Then, after she accepts, one of the twins says to the other, "you or me this time?" Her sister clearly responds, "Miranda said me."

In case you don't realize, Miranda is the African-Amereican assistant director who runs the program, played by Aunjanue Ellis. So, obviously, the FBI knows there are two of them.

I don't have a problem with people sharing their opinions, even if they are negative. But if you are going to bash something, you should at least have the facts straight.

Just for the record, I enjoyed it quite a lot and will be tuning in next week.
