I do not know Real American Accent, Real American body language (if something like that really exists) and I find this show a bit interesting. I started watching this hoping Quantico is some sort of Sci-Fi. 

The reviews here lacks intelligence. If it is a female's review, it will be about accent, body language and also one of the reviews had problem with FBI agent being too pretty. I guess, typical American accent for someone playing as a terrorist suspect will be a strict no-no?

Reviews ought to be honest. This is one of those moments where you realize not everyone has the talent to be a critic.
