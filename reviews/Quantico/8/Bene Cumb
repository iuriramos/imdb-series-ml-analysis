Recent years have seen a great increase in political thriller series, with rapidly altering scenes, sudden twists and angles, parallel events intersecting sooner or later, and other novel features not conventional in "older" related series where each episode had its commencement and closure (sometimes extended to 2-3 episodes). I have begun to like these new features, although one might observe sporadic over- sophistication or "art for thrill's sake", and receding from actuality at the expense of thrill and mystic elements. 

All the aforementioned is also present in Quantico - even though I am no FBI expert, there were scenes and character developments not very likely to happen within the post 9/11 FBI, but at least explanations were given, and the selection of actors did not include a major international star stealing the show; the cast was there as a team, there were no black-and-white approaches, and I found myself satisfied with the things I saw on screen - given the known U.S. attitudes, patriotic topics, political correctness vis-a-vis gender-race-ethnicity equality, etc. As I had no blah! feelings and I am eager to watch the following season as well (following a "messy" ending), I can easily give 8 points for the total effort. If you like such series, watch this - there are dozens of mediocre and weak ones out there...
