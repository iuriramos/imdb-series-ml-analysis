Just watched the pilot on ABC ... Will Be Brief: QUANTICO has a addictive premise, a cool mystery, an attractive cast and an interesting storytelling framework. It also is clearly following in the successful footsteps of Homeland, How To Get Away With Murder and Scandal. Though its pilot is fun and has a lot of promise yet a few flaws left, only time will tell whether the rest of the series can live up to the premiere's potential and for that the show-runners will obviously up their game or it might end up being just another crime drama and fade away.... I suggest you give the pilot a try, if you like it keep watching otherwise just leave it be. :)
