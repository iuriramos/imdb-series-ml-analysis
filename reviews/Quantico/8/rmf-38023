A few of my regular-watched shows are on hiatus and I was losing hope that I would find another show that would capture my attention and give me my fix for light TV entertainment ......And then I found QUANTICO. Its hands down my new favourite show.

The pilot didn't exactly blow me away but it spiked my interest. Now 4 episodes in, I am hooked! Human profiling & diving into peoples psyche fascinates me and you see a lot of it in this show. I like the different characters and whilst they are definitely not Grade A actors, I think they do a pretty damn good job.

Its well paced, interesting and there are twists that keep you guessing. Two thumbs up.
