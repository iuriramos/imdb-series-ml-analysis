Inspite of so much negative comments, I think this show is something to watch when you need a good time-pass. 

Maybe everyone is judging too quickly seeing only the first episode.

Although I must admit, initially showing the past and present together was a little annoying. Now (by the 5th-6th episode) its gotten better and more thrilling.

I am quite thrilled and waiting for the Climax episode. Watching this show makes me curious and thrilled. It is hot, interesting and fun.

It is definitely worth a watch. I enjoyed it. Give it a watch guys! Hope you enjoy it !
