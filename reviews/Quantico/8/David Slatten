SPOILER ALERT!!! 

Enjoyed the show and look forward to watching the rest of the season but the record must be set straight about Packer (the Mormon). The reason he killed himself was because he was afraid that his actions while on his mission would be made public. Those actions are that he slept with a young Malawian girl who became pregnant and then when he accompanied her to the abortion clinic, she died. The chances of this actually happening to a Mormon missionary are so small, they might as well not exist. First, missionaries are ALWAYS in a companionship with another missionary and they are admonished to ALWAYS stick together. Literally, the only time they are to be away from their companion is when they are in the bathroom or shower or the like. So the chances that Packer had enough time alone to sleep with the girl, let alone accompany her to an abortion clinic, are zero. A complete description of this rule can be found in the missionary handbook at https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/topics/missionary/MissionaryHa ndbook2006Navigate.pdf I understand it is fiction, but still, that needed to be said.
