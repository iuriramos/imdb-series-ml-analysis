I am definitely glad that I held in there and stuck around for more than 2 episodes of this show. I am completely invested in the plot and the characters. Each week has you running around in circles trying to solves a who dunnit style of story line. Just when you think you might have an idea as to 'who' it is, they through you another loop and you are completely baffled once again.

Though I am sure this show does not give you a true insight into the life of studying at Quantico. This show delivers on action, and the actors are all terrific. I can't fault a single performance.

I definitely can't wait for each new episode.
