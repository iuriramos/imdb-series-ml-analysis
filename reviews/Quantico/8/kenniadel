Quantico is one of those shows that all of us have seen before. Not literally, but as far as storyline and creativity go, we've all seen it. But here's the thing - Priyanka Chopra plays her role very convincingly. She's more than just a pretty face, that girl has talent. She manages to bring so many aspects to her character - strength, empathy, toughness, mystery and vulnerability. SHE is what makes her character alive. SHE is what drives the show. 

I've only seen the Pilot, but I'm definitely going to hang around. The show is interesting and has a "How to get away with Murder" vibe, another show I absolutely love. I'm not denying that there are going to be a lot of training scenes, where someone makes a mistake and pays or someone screws up and the others cover for them... we'll probably get to see a lot of the characters past's, why they joined, what makes them special, their secrets... And of course good old romance.

It's going to be full of action, heartbreak, death, drama, mystery and questions. All things I like seeing in a show. I just hope that they'll bring it across in a new way and not go with the same old bullshit like every show does. Quantico still needs something unique to it, in order to make not good, but great.
