I like the pace of the series and the characters. The FBI training aspects are well researched and seem realistic, however in other places the script takes convenient shortcuts. Overall, even though some of the plot developments are unrealistic (e.g. external contractor able to easily access FBI servers or ability to contact the dark web and summon a meeting, all in a matter of minutes), I do enjoy the series and it keeps me interested and wanting to know more. I also like the way the plot constantly keeps shifting the doubt onto new people and makes you wonder what their hidden agenda may be.

The best parts focus on parallels between FBI training in the past and the current events. 

It is a shame that some parts are so unrealistic, as it detracts from the skill level of the FBI trainees.

There are also some aspects of romantic comedy intertwined, which I personally enjoy but may prove a bit of an odd mix for a thriller.
