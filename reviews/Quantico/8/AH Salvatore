Well to be honest, I'm not a big fan of such genre , like FBI series and all that, but just because of Pritanka Chopra I gave this one a try. But Out of Expectations this Series is looking really promising as Priyanka Chopra has got not just a pretty face but that girl has got some real talent too. Storyline is good, Pilot was definitely a thriller, introduction of all the characters were really nicely done. At Every moment you get really curious that what's going to happen next.As it is an FBI kinda show so you could expect a lot of murders and get away from murders scenes.And another golden point of this show which really caught my attention was the theme song of the series. That is one hell of a song, I really liked it, the composition is awesome and made you hum and dance along. I definitely Recommend this Guys.
