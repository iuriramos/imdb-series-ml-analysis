No, that's not a pun but it would work as a pun. This series opener was explosive. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat for the last five minutes. That was partially because I'd drunk two massive cups of tea during the course of the show and nature was calling, but largely it was due to the interesting story telling. 

When the show started, I thought this was Shonda Rhimes. Specifically, the replacement for Grey's Anatomy since that's entered a pretty steep downslope in the last few years. It has all the same ingredients, interesting characters at the start of a high octane, high pressure, high flying career each with their own compelling backstory. As the premiere progressed, it continued with its Shonda Rhimes feel suggesting this was going to be a show about the characters set around case of the week. Then you enter the last 15mins and ohhhhhh son!!!! This ain't one for the "X- Factor crowd." This show does not look like you will be able to slip in and slip out and still keep up with the plot. It's looking to be all story arc, all the time, just how I like it. Quantico is definitely going to be in my TV roster for the 2015/2016 season. I am waiting for episode 2. I have given it 8 starts based upon the series premiere. That will go up to a full 10 if they can keep this level of intrigue through the season.
