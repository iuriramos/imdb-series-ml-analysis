Sick of seeing typical or schematized police series, in which depending on the intention we find ones focused on the crimes or other focused on entertain, and we find Quantico, a non defined yet.

My happiness with this discovery is centered in four main reasons: firstly, because it is new. Nowadays we have to search at many series to find one like this. The plot between 8 months ago and now makes it absolutely interesting. Secondly, the diversity of genres. The superiority of thriller, combined with fresh comical touch, and with spaces for typical love stories, and not so common, like the one between Shelby and Caleb's father, and the drama always present. Thirdly, the reception of an actual theme such as terrorism and how police struggles it. And finally because it has something that only good series are able to,the ability to get us hooked in this unlimited chain of events.

My congratulations, because in my book, a masterpiece has been created
