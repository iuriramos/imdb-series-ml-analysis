Very nice show. just watched the pilot and will watch all episodes. Love Priyanka. Superb acting and looks like its going to be a good show. I thing is a first show fully on FBI. I mean from the training to operation. They are focusing on India Actor I liked that very Much. Big Fan of shows like these who focus on FBI. I like the way it started with the building crash. Its different from other shows and looks like its gonna work for me. The casts look great and good acting by every buddy especially by Priyanka Chopra. I know she will rock the floor. she is a very good actor in India and she will prove her self in US TV series also. Love You Priyanka.
