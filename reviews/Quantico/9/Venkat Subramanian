I am not sure if most of these negative reviews are giving up on the show too early. I didn't sync up at all with the first few episodes. But I decided to give it time for obvious reasons, Priyanka Chopra and the fact that I am from India and I know her from there. P.s: Like on reviewer here pointed out, I am not a sucker for Indian melodrama as I have loved many American shows which are highly rated by the emotionless people.

This show flips back and forth between the flashback and reality with such alarming pace that at times it feels "oh come on, why couldn't you just stay there?". But this show gets very interesting in plot as each episode goes. Like peeling the skin one by one. I am continuing with this one and will wait for Season 2 to go on some streaming site as I like binge watching this.
