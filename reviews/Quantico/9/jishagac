Though the show failed to keep up the excellence it showed in the beginning , its still a good show. I have to agree that the middle episodes was kinda repetitive , the climax episodes showed its class. They made the audience bite their finger tips. Casting was not up to the mark but wasn't too worse either. Priyanka played justice to her role. The main mistake I saw is that the episodes after S01E11 was kinda too repetitive. It felt like the same episodes are happening again. Same issue , same idea , happening twice. Also the spark of rivalries the show pointed to by the start of the show was long gone by the end. But it really played big in the last couple of episodes . Overall it's a cool show for me.
