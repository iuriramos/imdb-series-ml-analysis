I didn't like her before but the movie "Barfi" made me look at her in a whole different way. i think she proved the whole movie industry how excellent actress she is through that movie. You will look twice to see if its really the miss world in that movie, Thats how great she was in that movie. She is new to the western industry so people give her a break. and i don't think a shows success is totally rest on one person, writer, producer, directors and actors make a show success. i think she need to be a little bit more strong in the post training period of her character. when she is in the training period its fine but the character after the training period should be strong in my opinion. She played a cop in the movie "Don" she was excellent in that. All the actors are doing great in those episodes. After the first episode people made so many comments how can this take place in FBI academy, but the second episode proved their comments wrong. people said i wont watching anymore after the first one cause they said the story is so predictable, well, you all can say obviously that the story wasn't predictable. so stop judging too quickly. if you don't want to watch it don't watch nobody is asking you to. but stop commenting nonsense stuff.
