I LOVE IT to the point where I'm downright sad when the episode ends !

For those of you complaining about the accent..well that's the whole point of it isn't it ? The person is accused of being a terrorist and you want them to have an American accent? Duh.

The gay guy kisses a random guy on the street coz he doesn't want to appear as a loser at the FBI academy and wants to show his batch mates that he has a boyfriend by keeping that as a framed photo in his room there. 

And the twins are there without anyone knowing about it because the FBI is in on it and are conducting an experiment with those two.

So there, for all those who were unable to understand those things on their own..i spelled it out for you coz your brains have probably been half fried because of sitting in front of the idiot box all day.
