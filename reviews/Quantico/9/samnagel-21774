I was very intrigued and excited to start watching this series. Finally a mixed, diverse kind of drama where the heroine is not (sorry girls) a white girl, nothing against, I'm white too. It just gets boring. But now, we have the gorgeous and talented Priyanka Chopra on TV, a diverse plot, great! Nothing is perfect. It's a good show, it does get better as story develops. It's actually getting pretty awesome towards the final. Now, I want season 2! In today's world we tend to expect perfection or we think we are way smarter when we are watching TV series... it upsets me how some critics just bash and humiliate some shows they see on TV. If you don't like it don't watch it.
