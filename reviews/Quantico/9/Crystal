the gap between episode 11 and 12 was way too big. I've completely lost track of the story. Can't remember names, who's who and what exactly went down before. A shame, because now I'm inclined to simply look for another series to watch, and it is a good series. I like how it jumps back from present to the training classes, to slowly see things unravel. I like the cast, particularly agent Parish. Shame to read that so many people give this show such bad reviews. Not a 100% realistic, so what? It's not a docu, it's a show. It's not Homeland. Good! I didn't like Homeland! At least Quantico doesn't have an irritating neurotic main character with a personality disorder who needs to pop pills in order to stay reasonably sane. Since everyone is so negative, it is likely going to get pulled. A shame. One of the few shows out that I actually really like to watch!
