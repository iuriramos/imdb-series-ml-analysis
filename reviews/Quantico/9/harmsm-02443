I want to clarify that I give this show a 9 out of 10 rating on a scale rating it for what it is--a super entertaining drama slash mystery that follows a group of FBI recruits! Don't watch this and expect the depth of Homeland etc. etc. 

This is the FBI conspiracy equivalent of a good Shondaland show. Super dramatic. Super hot actors. Interesting story line with the occasional minor plot hole. Great to watch after a long day at work when you really just want something entertaining and shocking and twisty and engaging without all of the thinking some (great) shows require.

I really enjoy the plot overall. I like that it is a fantasy version of FBI training. Who doesn't love to see their fantasy ideal of FBI training at Quantico lived out on screen with all of the drama and corruption you love to see in fiction? I'm not an FBI trainee, but I assume it is not super realistic and accurate. I'm OK with that! 

For viewers who love a good TV drama/mystery, it is worth checking out! For those of you brainiacs who demand realism and accuracy, pass on it. I don't think you'll enjoy it as much as I did :) No judgment, intended!
