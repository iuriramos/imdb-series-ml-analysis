This show has denigrated into the biggest stinking pile of garbage I have seen in a long time. This baby boy/baby girl crap between Garcia, the overweight creepy, weepy computer tech. and one of the BAU has got to be the most ridiculous piece of writing I have seen in a long time. Then you throw in Prentiss and the genius geek with all their personal problems and it equals an extremely weak writing staff without any ideas except falling back on the BAU members personal and family problems. Jeez, talk about a big pile of stink. I used to watch and DVR this show when it first came on the air, now I do not even bother, especially when I see an episode with some sort of member problem like Garcia and her boyfriend. Who gives a crap about her personal problems. Do your job, suck it up or start a Hallmark store with Prentiss and the other weak members of your team.
