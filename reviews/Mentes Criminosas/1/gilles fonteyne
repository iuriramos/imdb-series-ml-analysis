Wow , normally i think the rating system on IMDb works very well but here i say it has failed. I simply hat this series with all my guts. The show is just boring and the acting is awful. I in total saw 3 episodes an 2 of them we're very similar , at one point they invade a building but it's a trap and they realize it right in time and get out. another thing that was similar was that the got information by telling the suspect that the thing that they wanted to happen happened but in reality it didn't. The characters are stupid and stereotypes , the weird lab-girl is just Aby from NCIS , the smart dude is just the guy from numb3rs and the boss is just a boss. this show has nothing appealing and is dirt in my eyes , the people who like this are on a LCD-trip
