I been viewing this show since it started and all I see is the same Plot. "unsub" is deranged FBI must come in to help ignorant police and local detectives who cannot point out the obvious but somehow these "Saviors" must help us "normal" people out like we cannot decipher things out ourselves. Plus we must sit through the "bad" agent Derek Morgan work out his demons by beating out suspects (who are somehow related or the actual perpetrators) to reconcile his demeanor. I would only continue to like this show if somehow they would change the setting. like the police in whatever city they are in would not be so ignorant and make a difference. Kind of makes you think of how Hollywood sees the People and would recognize. But I guess if it sells it sells.
