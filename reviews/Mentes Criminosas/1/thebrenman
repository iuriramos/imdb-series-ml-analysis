I first heard about Criminal Minds when a friend recommended it to me, after she heard that I liked NCIS. Sitting and watching Criminal Minds made me think only one thing. I want those 45 minutes of my life back.

That one episode I watched, was extremely similar to one of NCIS. The characters are also extremely similar. For example, you have the tough person, and then you have the nerdy skinny person.

There is nothing more to say, accept that this movie was awful, and will probably be running strong BECAUSE OF NCIS, for as long as NCIS is still around. And IF NCIS happens to cancel, I guarantee that Criminal Minds will follow too.

1 star out of 10, and nothing more. If not, it should be less. This type of junk is what you use as a napkin.
