I'm a big fan of thrillers. I have come across many worst shows, but nothing is as disgusting as this one. I have no idea how could someone cast "Mandy Patinkin" in a lead role. His every single dialog delivery irritates me to the core. This show does not give any technical details on how the killer works or how the profilers are trying to track killers down, but they somehow catch the killers and we have to assume that these guys are experts. This should be called a magic show... Since actors make some face expressions as if they are thinking really hard and after some time magically they catch the killer, without giving viewers any underlying technical details or facts that they are using to track the killer. Do they think viewers are so dumb...?

If you want to watch crime detective thrillers then watch CSI - a great show and Bones or Numbers which are good shows and give complete technical details and facts that the characters in the shows put together to arrive at a conclusion, respecting viewers intelligence. Criminal Minds should not be even considered as a below average show. It's waste of viewers time. 

Finally, do not waste your precious time on this terrible show...
