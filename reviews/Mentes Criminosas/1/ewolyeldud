This thing has slumped to an even keel with Halloweenie "LIII", budget must be around $125 an episode. You would be better served by watching re-runs or by reading a book on ancient knitting techniques. this stuff is not even "camp" its damp. Truly a waste of fine actor talent. This is still a great fashion parade for Penelope Garcia's glasses, maybe more muscly chest shots from Derek Morgan would pull this stinker out of the mud-hole its bogged down in. Of coarse a few more cute babies from Jennifer Jareau could warm our tear-less hearts.....and where's William LaMontagne. Somebody hire another barber for Dr. Reid and Dr. Tara. Yuck!!! This is right there with "Once Upon a Time"
