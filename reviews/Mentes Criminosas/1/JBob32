The characters in this show rarely talk to each other in a realistic manner. You can divide the dialogue into categories: putting someone down, describing an "unsub", delivering plot points (narrative), cool sounding sound-bites and the occasional, extremely rare, actual human interaction.

Who ever heard of a team of 5 people giving a presentation to a local police detachment where each team member speaks one sentence in a choreographed verbal merry-go-round. But this happens in each and every episode.

Predictable per episode: - the black guy will tackle someone without any assistance just before everyone else arrives (I guess he drives in a different and faster car) - the local law enforcement are idiots and are berated as such multiple times - the word "unsub" will be repeated multiple times and other "technical" terms will be used to make the team sound extra smart and then the terms will be explained to the locals who are too stupid to understand - one character will walk into a room and ask another "whats up?" at which point the other character will explain some detail of the case as if the first person had no training whatsoever. In reality this is just talking directly to the audience and delivering plot points to move the story along according to the predictable fill in the blanks script pattern.

Horrible, yet typical crime drama.
