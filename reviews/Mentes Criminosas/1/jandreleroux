The story is OK. But the relationship between Penelope and Derek is about as realistic and inspiring as Donald Trump

Also the episode 11.16 could not have been worse if Trump. Bush,Hitler, Pol Pot and the North Korean Dictator co-wrote!

It irritates me that the chars are so half painted. Rossy is always OK. Penelope is always stressed. She is a cheap rip-off of Abby-the NCIS Goth girl- and all that Penelope portrays convincingly is that she's is overweight, like me!

Hodge has the character of a half-baked brick And Spence reminds me of the kid who never stops peeing his pants

The other chars have not been convincing enough that I remember their names even though I have watched every episode TJ. Yes the disappearing blonde is TJ In spite of all this criticism I keep on watching CM and am grateful that they stop the Chinese rip off with Forrest "wandering eye" Whittaker
