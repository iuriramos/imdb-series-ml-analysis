I don't know why they killed so many people. Have they ever heard of shooting someone in arm, legs and not in hearth or head? And then they say like oh we could not save him. Yes you could just shoot him in arm or any part of the body where he will not die. 

Every Episode has the same plot twist. 

They will teach you that every criminal is doing killings because of his sexual release. yea right... 

If you are dumb civilian you will probably like this show because you never used your brain for any kind of critical thinking.

They never show how killings are done, they just cut the scene and boom he is dead. I mean is this show for kids? Like Pegy16?

Sometimes they say like killers are highly intelligent but no they are not, they are really nothing special, every team can find them.
