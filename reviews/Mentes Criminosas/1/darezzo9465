With every prosecution, even a "positively entertaining" one, there must be a defense. In this case, a devil's advocate, or public defender for Frankenstien (the monster, not its creator) must step up. Finally we are admitting that monsters don't happen in a vacuum; that monsters are elicited almost invariably with a victim's beginning, one not of childhood abuse, but of torture. The show's writers advert to this showing scenes of the child being turned into a monster, but I notice the scenes are hazy and not very graphic like those which show what the "unsub" does later. No cigarette burns, whip marks, contusions, abrasions, stab wounds, etc. They only show the child being shamed, but looking healthy and clean, well fed. The scenes are hazy and fuzzy. Not all abused (Tortured) boys grow up to be monsters, the writers are careful to note. However, the forensic experts fail to advert to what makes the boy-child "unsub" different. Cruel torture of a male child by a female adult. Let's explore that, experts. Every coward who preys on the weak was once the weak being preyed on by a "weaker-sex" coward. Bottom line.
