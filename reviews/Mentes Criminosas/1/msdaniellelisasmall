I want to start off my saying i like this show. BUT season 2, ep 18, the New Orleans episode was so LOL. AND a big cringe fest! The accents!!

Are you serious? The detective said daddy 100 times and another detective said because a girl wore so many beads on Mardi Gras (about the only not dorky time to wear them) she was exposing herself and asked to be raped. WHAT?! Also, ONLY tourists show their tits for beads.

It was also filmed on a lot or in L.A. Come on, don't be so cheap, at least get some exterior shots. Damn. And learn how to pronounce New Orleans if you're doing a show about the city.

It was done really lazy and I am disappointed. I may stop watching the show.
