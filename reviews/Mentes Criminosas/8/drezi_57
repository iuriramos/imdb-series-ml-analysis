I'm not a good reviewer and my English isn't good enough to write a decent review but i'm going to make an exception for this show. I am though a hardcore TV fan, i've watched a lot of TV shows and movies in my lifetime so i might be worth listening to.

Why am i making an exception? I hate cop shows. Cop shows to me are all the same and usually don't bring anything new to the table. Criminal Minds does however bring a great forensic psychology. Criminal Minds revolves around FBI's behavior analysis unit who specialize in examining criminal minds to find the bad guy. The show does well of keeping you questioning who the bad guy is and once you find out who he is all you want to know is why did he/she do this? And the show usually has a good psychological explanation as to why this happened. You get a peak into twisted criminal minds, get to know their story and the events that occurred that led to their crimes. The main characters of the show are of course important and for a cop show i would rate the character development above average. Its not masterful but enough to fit the show. 

If you're like me and don't like typical cop shows then i would suggest checking out Criminal Minds, as it was to me better then expected.
