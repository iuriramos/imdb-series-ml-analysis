I'm a big fan of detective/forensic type dramas and this is definitely one of the best. I get a little bit annoyed with shows like CSI which can be really predictable, which is why I enjoy watching this show because it isn't so predictable. Often the killer is someone I completely haven't guessed, which makes it a good watch.

I also agree that it does seem like Hotch is the only one who has a life - I admire the writers trying to keep the focus of the show on the actual crimes and killers, but I think that by introducing us to more of the characters personal lives and backgrounds, it helps the audience relate more to them and thus empathise with them when they get in dangerous situations.

But apart from this, Criminal Minds is an excellent show, and I definitely recommend it to people who are looking for another detective type show that's a bit less predictable.
