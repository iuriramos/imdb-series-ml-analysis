Criminal Minds is one of my favorite show ever. Sure it's very dark and often repetitive but what I'm more interested in is the relationship between the team members.

They are more than a team. They are quite a family and they care for each other when one of them is struck by a tragedy. This strong relationship is their strength and they always face the danger together.

I also like the little snippet into the family life of the characters, seeing them acting with their children and companions. It's refreshing and a nice breakout of the huge darkness surrounding their work.

The atmosphere is sure very oppressive and intense as we see the agents trying to enter the minds of the most twisted serial killers of the country to prevent them for murdering another innocent people. How the investigation is unfolding is shot in a very intuitive way almost making us a part of their audience. Sometimes I found myself making deductions to understand the motive of the killers even if most of the time I got it wrong. Not everybody has the mind of a profiler. But that's OK as I don't intend to become one. I wouldn't have lasted long in that line of work anyway.

That wont change the fact that I wish this show lasts for several years and please make Derek and Penelope a real couple. They are so cute together.
