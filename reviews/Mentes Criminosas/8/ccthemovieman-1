These were usually interesting stories of the FBI's profiling group called the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unite) in which crimes ares solved by understanding what kind of person commits then. Most often, after figuring out who the killer is, the group goes in and captures him or her. The first 30 minutes of each show are basically cerebral while the last 10 minutes are action- oriented. Profiled and - hopefully - caught are serial killers, usually, there are also serial arsonists, rapists, etc.

Co-heading the unit are veteran actor Mandy Patakin who plays the stone-faced, 50-ish "Jason Gideon," and the younger "Aaron Hotchner" (Thomas Gibson). The latter is the most stable person in the unit and the only one married with a family. The rest - like most crime shows today - are single people and usually in their late 20s or 30s. I guess, technically Hotchner heads the unit, the it feels more like Gideon does. It's his narration that beings and ends each show.

Completing the team, you have the young, nerd-looking "Dr. Spencer Reid" (Matthew GrayGruber) who seems to know everything about everything; the volatile "Elle Greenaway" (Lola Glaudini); the macho "Derek Morgan" (Shelmar Moore), group spokesperson "J.J. Jareau (A.J. Cook) and he computer geek "Penelope Garcia" (Kristin Vangsness).

Story-wise, the show has the usual Liberal bent of today's TV but doesn't go overboard with it in most cases. Many of the shows feature a very tense conclusion as someone is being saved at the last minute from some serial killer. Not that it matters, but after watching the complete first season on DVD, I liked "Hotch" the best and "Garcia" the least.

I look forward to seeing the second season on DVD, as well. (I refuse to watch regular TV with all the commercials ruining the shows.)
