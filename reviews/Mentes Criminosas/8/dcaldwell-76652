When I first started this show, I didn't really expect to like it so much because I wasn't into the whole crime solving shows. This show, however, blew my mind. It held the right amount of action, mystery, and humor. I loved this show because each crime is different. I also love this show because of how much you can relate to the characters. You have the cold and quiet detective, you have the overly smart one, you have the funny one, you have the adorable one, etc. This show is easy to fall in love with! I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good crime.Compared to other crime shows, I believe this one is definitely the best. The only con about this show is that it's not long enough!
