/refers to Seasons 1-11/

Although an our TV-channel had shown it partially for some time, it never really caught my attention, I was more into Lewises and Poirots at that time, regarding crime series... But this summer, when weather was not so good, I decided to go into Criminal Minds from the very beginning. Well, the cases to be dealt with and solved were most very nasty and raw, but several characters - both good and bad - were those who I began to follow, who make the episodes more watchable as they are based on their scripts. 

First and foremost, Dr. Spencer Reid, pleasantly performed by Matthew Gray Gubler. To me, the events and dialogues connected to him are the highlights of this series, and the episodes without him were more trivial and impassive. 

Secondly, Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin). Alas, he participated in Seasons 1-3 only, and I had difficulties to accept his successor David Rossi for a long time. Besides, Joe Mantegna as actor was quite unknown to me. The other main characters have their place and logic as well, but they are more holders of certain types and characteristics seen in many other crime series. At times, they are overshadowed by strong character actors who have episodic roles in the series, often as habitual criminals (e.g. Tim Curry, Anton Yelchin, Gary Sinise). 

True, perhaps the number of seasons-episodes is already too big, but then, some new angles or events appear, and you become excited what happens now, how this crazy outcome will be resolved, could the new performances provide additional value, etc. In spite of several flashbacks and explanations, it is recommended to watch all the episodes sequentially. 

And last but not least - Criminal Minds is definitely not for you if you are firmly against death penalty and/or non-violent detention of offenders.
