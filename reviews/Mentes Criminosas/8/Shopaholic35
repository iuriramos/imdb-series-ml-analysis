Criminal minds is one of my favourite crime drama shows. All the cases are really unique and interesting and I never feel like they are running out of ideas. Each character plays their role perfectly and even though they are all different they all fit well together and it creates a realistic bond/relationship. My favourite character is Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler). He is just so adorable and naive yet incredibly intelligent and intuitive. But all the cast is great.

I may personally love crime shows but Criminal Minds is a more accessible show for the masses. It's great that a broad audience can experience the excitement that a crime drama can create without feeling overwhelmed with too much focus on procedure.
