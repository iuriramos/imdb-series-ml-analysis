I have watched all episodes of CM since Season 1 up to now. This is my number 1 favorite show ever. The best seasons so far to me is Season 1, 3 and back to 7. Now in S08, with the loss of Paget Brewster (Emily)(she went on to do another crime series, not sure which network), this show is slowly deteriorating. It is becoming very repetitive and less interesting.

I have nothing against Jean Triplehorn (Blake), I think she's a good actress, it's just that she's not right for such a role. Or perhaps, they just need to make her character more interesting. Her character is not helping the show become more interesting.

I love the way Matthew Grey Gubler directs some of the episodes and I really hope they do something to save this show because it is becoming really boring. I am hoping that they last another season, maybe make it up to season 10 but they really need to put on more creative ideas here, intensify scenes they way they were in season 1 or at least 7. 

This show needs to be saved for the sake of ever LOYAL FANS out here like us!!!! Please!!
