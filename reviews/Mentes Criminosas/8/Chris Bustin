I happen to have caught this show a few episodes into the series, from that point i was hooked. Already being a CSI fan i was looking forward to more of the same, but this did something else it looked at it from the behavioural profilers point of view. Having read this premise in a right up I was expecting another cracker clone, but this had action in it as well. As you may guess from the way this rambles somewhat i am hard pushed to pin down what precisely I like about this show, all I can say is that I do. It is helped by the fact that the cast play their respective roles superbly, led by the much underrated Mandy Patinkin. I would recommend anyone who likes there police programmes to look at it from another angle give this a try.
