Criminal Minds takes a unique spin on crime drama much different than the popular CSI and NCIS. The show revolves around a team of behavioral analysts working in the F.B.I as they aid in profiling and capturing criminals. Unlike other crime TV shows that are heavily based on the forensic side of catching criminals, Criminal Minds focuses on the physiological and behavioral aspects of how criminals are caught.

Mandy Patinkin leads a group along with other stars such as Matthew Gubler and Sheemar Moore. Each episode is unique in its own right as the team is faced with a different killer who gives the team a true test of their wits. As a viewer, each episode is like a different puzzle for them as each criminal places their own interesting M.O (Modus Operandi) to their crimes.

The continuous twists and surprises the show offers is the backbone of its success. Some people in the show are not truly who they claim to be leaving the audience playing guessing games with the show until the last few minutes of the episode where everything is unfolded.

To be honest, I stopped faithfully watching this show once Mandy Patinkin left. i have nothing against Joe Mantenga I just personally felt that the show was not the same once Mandy departed. Maybe I just don't like change, or Mandy Just played his role too well. The opening cut scenes where it shows the criminal committing his/her crime I find a little corny and sometimes a little cheesy.

But for the most part, It is a show worth giving a shot especially if you are into the criminal mind.
