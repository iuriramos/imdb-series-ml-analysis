This show is really addictive! I think it's the best crime show on television. It has the right amount of action, suspense, and comedy. I love how it can draw you in and keep you guessing. Another thing I liked about this show is how relatable the characters are! You have the tall, serious guy, the young smart guy, the adorable funny one, and a whole bunch of other relatable characters. Not only are the plots great, the people who work on this show are very talented! The actors portray their characters fantastically. The only con I have about this show is that it's not long enough! So, if you're into the dramatic and suspenseful crime shows, I totally recommend Criminal Minds.
