Just saw the latest episode of the brown hair women killing people because of the grief of the loss of her son.

The only issue I have with this show is the profilers more or less guarantee what they say is true. They never say "if we profile this person it falls under this category, but on the otherhand, there is a chance this could be a crazy person who just does random things".

Therefore, this show is a mess.

Lastly in the latest episode it made no sense for the security guard to go off in alarm when a motherly figure checks on a child if he is OK. This makes no sense as we live in a sexist society, in which the security guard would definitely check on a male who did the same thing as he would suspect child predator but would never suspect on a female as he would think "motherly figure".
