I have watched four Criminal Minds episodes, including the pilot and, as of this posting, the episode entitled "Sex, Birth, Death". As much as I like Mandy Patinkin and the eye candy that seem to always be employed in these shows (Thomas Gibson and Shemar Moore), I find Criminal Minds to be a very grim, ugly and, ultimately, pointless crime drama.

Considering the very dark subject matter and the fact that a few other current shows that have done a better job in storytelling and creating interesting lead characters (i.e.: Law & Order: SVU, the original C.S.I.), Criminal Minds is just picking up the uninteresting scraps from other police procedural dramas.

I noticed that the show is slowly becoming a big hit in the Nielsen ratings for CBS. I just wished the show was of better quality to merit the higher ratings.
