I was a big fan of Criminal Minds until I realised how utterly ridiculous the show has become! If I hear the word "unsub" one more time I will scream!! How many times during a show do we have to hear "unsub"? Do they get royalties from subway? 

The profiles conjured up by these so called "experts" are beyond idiotic and if viewers can not recognize how ridiculous and wrong they are, then people are slow! But, the profiles can be forgiven if it wasn't for the dynamic of the team! Derek and Garcia carry on like teenagers calling each other "lover boy", "baby cakes", " sexy girl" while a grieving mother is standing within earshot! In what universe is it normal in a work place to call fellow employees sexy nick names while investigating murders? It creeps me out a lot and I cringe every-time I hear it! 

I could pick each character apart considering each if them has massive emotional and mental issues but it would bore me! 

One thing I must mention is Garcia's ability to go online and retrieve information from decades ago that wouldn't even be available online! Honestly, the majority of the stuff she comes up with from her "search" is insulting to the viewers! Yes, there are excellent hackers around but nobody can retrieve information or personal photos from 1960 that have never been downloaded! 

I would love to know if the American law enforcement organisation really has personal jets just waiting around! 

The storyline is often beyond realistic and I really wish shows didn't aim the storyline to is leptons who will believe anything!
