This show is about a team of investigators, headed by a quirky, omniscient father figure, investigating violent murders. Sound familiar? It should. This is just another CSI. And not a very good one. Within the CSI spectrum, I'd place this below Miami, but above NY, which isn't saying much, as Miami and NY are pretty mediocre television.

The acting is good, but the actors have nothing to work with- the writing is completely paint by numbers. Each show follows a cookie cutter formula, the plots rarely extend over multiple shows, the character development is feeble and the show has almost no humor. Every episode involves a last minute 'are they going to make it?' type of plot device. Ultimately, it gets very tiring and predictable.

Other than the grisly subject matter, this show feels like it it's being targeted towards the elderly. The dialog is slow, the plots are brutally simple/easy to understand, there's zero pop culture references, there's no need to remember details from previous shows- very little is expected of the viewer.

I watched the first 12 episodes (on DVD) in hopes that it would somehow improve/develop a life of it's own. It didn't.
