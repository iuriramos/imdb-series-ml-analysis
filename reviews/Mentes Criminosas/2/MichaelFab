I officially stop watching this stupid show tonight after seeing the premise: beating people over the head, tying them to a car bumper & dragging their bodies on the road. I started watching this show 5 years ago because I like Joe Mantegna, but he's only in it for the paycheck. The early seasons had intriguing stories and chemistry among the cast. Now every single episode is about a sick, sadistic man (usually) who abducts people and cuts their body parts off, or tortures people to death because the writers can't think of anything else. In one episode, a killer gouges victims eyes out. Another, he cuts their ears off. Another, he cuts people's internal organs out.

The "team" look like a bunch of GQ models, simultaneously spouting out their textbook knowledge of Criminal Science, but not actually conversing or listening to each other. They all talk at the same time, and even finish each others's sentences. They act so intelligent, like they have Masters degrees in Criminal Justice & Forensic Science, but they don't get a speck of dirt on their designer clothes. It's so phony, it's ridiculous. I love dark, violent thrillers, but challenging, original stories that we care about, and characters who have conversations, not all talking together as if they know everything. I'm glad everyone else likes the show, but I can't take this same old formulaic, conceited nonsense anymore.
