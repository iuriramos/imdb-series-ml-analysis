I have managed to finish the first series since I have bought it. Some stories are quite good but unfortunately I find certain characters too stereotype and in fact boring. Dr. Spencer Reid should have some other characteristic to make the character more interesting. He should not be so boring and a little humble maybe. He even speaks in monotone with little facial expression. Penelope Garcia should make her character more interesting and less irritating too. If you have watched "24", you will know what I mean as the characters there are very interesting, often funny and likable. I read that Mandy and Paget will be leaving the series. Pity, as I do like them.
