I'm watching this show for this first time and like all the other crime shows like CSI and Without a Trace, this show is full of grisly, exploitative violence that seems to be there just for the sake of grisly, exploitative violence. But moreover, the writing is full of melodrama and overwrought emotion. The actors are similarly hammy and really pile it on. Mandy Patinkin, in particular, is full of false pathos. I understand that you need to make a show sensational, but does it always have to be child molestation and murder? Maybe this is fun for some, but for me, it makes me feel icky for watching it. I don't care if they catch the criminal; I'm not going to make it through this episode.
