Why Criminal Minds is my favourite crime show on TV: 1. the investigators seem to have empathy, it's obvious that they are passionate about what they do. Even though they deal with horrific things all the time it still 'gets' to them. The investigators know that the victims are real people. 2. Occasionally more 'personal' elements get woven in to the plot & we find out more about each of the investigators. For instance, a lot happens with Spencer - in one episode we find out about a childhood trauma that he has repressed/forgotten that involves his father, and in another episode he gets kidnapped by a 'nerdy' guy who he has quite a lot in common with. The investigators in Criminal Minds are interesting three-dimensional characters who are portrayed with a lot of humanity. Bones is the only other crime show on TV that I sometimes watch - in some ways it is similar to criminal minds (eg. the investigators get personally involved in the plot, for instance in one episode Bones finds out about her parents). Other crime shows on TV are very boring & don't give the victims much respect. CSI and SVU spend too much time looking coldly at disfigured bodies, and too little time developing the human side of the show or the investigators. The investigators rarely seem moved by anything, and the victims are rarely shown as fully human before they are murdered. If they're going to have a person get murdered, they should at least show that person some respect before killing them off by taking care to portray them with compassion, and as fully human. Crime shows are a dodgy genre because they feed off of our desire to see the darkest parts of human experience. Crime programs that don't ask the viewer to really care about the victim before killing the victim off are simply uncomfortably voyeuristic & sadistic/dark.
