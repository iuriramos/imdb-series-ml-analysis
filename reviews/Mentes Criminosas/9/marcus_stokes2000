This show is about the members of a particular FBI team, the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit), which is dedicated to track down and find authors of serial crimes, be they kidnapping, murder, massacre, poisoning, arson or others, using the (not 100% exact) science of Psychological Profiling.

The team members are quite different; Aaron 'Hotch' Hotchner (Thomas Gibson), a married father of one; Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin), a well-known authority in the world of Profilers; Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore), specialized in obsessive crimes, who somehow manages to maintain his happy-go-lucky nature; Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini), specialized in Sex Crimes, who's tough as nails, Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), a child prodigy, kind of impaired socially, Jennifer 'JJ' Jarreau (A.J. Cook), the Unit's press liaison, who is one smart gal, and Penelope Garcia (Kristen Vangness), the Unit's computer expert, who also is a bright spot in the dark world they often have to visit.

'Criminal Minds' is probably the first show to have the figure of the profiler as main character since NBC's CSI inspirator 'Profiler' and FOX's 'MillenniuM', which though treated the profiling as some sort of supernatural gift (Profiler only did this from season 3 onwards, though).

This time, though, it's all very realistic, including the stress and the burnout of the job; the scripts are really thought out and well written, the actors do a very good job, and everything else comes together to create one of the most engaging series on TV now.

Criminal Minds: 9/10.
