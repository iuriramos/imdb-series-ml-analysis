This show is excellent, it had me on the edge of my seat all of the time i was watching it. It was a great show with lots of surprises and kept you thinking the whole time. Also it is very realistic and not out of reach ideas. Highly recommended!!! I enjoyed the arson episode the most. It was suspenseful! The acting is very believable. The scenes make you think and to secure your doors! I love this show and I will definitely. DEFINITELY WATCH ALL OF IT! I hope this show will be on for a long time to come. This show has me on the edge of my seat and will continue to do so. I hope that i helped to convince some to watch because this show does not disappoint.
