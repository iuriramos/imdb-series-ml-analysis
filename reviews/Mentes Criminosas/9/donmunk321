As I have a big interest in true crime books,films and documentaries often crime shows and films have a lot missing for me. I mean I generally enjoy films and shows about catching serial killers (true or fictional) but often they don't really explain the motive of the killer or why his modus operandi (method) is like that, they skip over that part and just catch the killer. 

Where as Criminal Minds is all about the studying the psychology of the killers and why they do it, which is very interesting and a nice change. 

A lot of Criminal Minds episodes are clearly based off real serial killers, although they change there names and often locations such as the episode "Unfinished Business" is loosely based of Dennis Rader (B.T.K) and they often quote facts about serial killers so it shows the writers are more than likely true crime fans as well.

This is one of the better crime shows out there, great acting and you begin to feel for all the characters, I love Gideon from the early series and Reed is just a cool unique character. 

If you're into true crime this will be right up your street, its about looking into the mind of the killer and working out his next plan of action rather that just turning up to another crime scene dusting for prints which I see to often on TV, yes i know its a important part of investigations but it's nice to see the other side of the investigation which is rarely seen, they do it in films like Manhunter/Red Dragon.
