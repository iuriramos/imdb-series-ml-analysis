Not only is the script well thought of and well written, but the actors pull it off tremendously too! Usually i find an annoying character, but in criminal minds they are all fantastic. The programme keeps me watching and I'm so in-patient to see the next one the following week. Thing about criminal minds is that the suspense and mystery is different from other dramas like it and i love it how it finishes and starts a different investigation each episode. The physcological in-depth of the programme is great, it gives me a great in sight of analysing people, and its a programme of its kind as i haven't seen another programme like it. Without a doubt Criminal Minds is one of the best programmes around at the moment, and I just can't wait for my Friday nights to watch it!
