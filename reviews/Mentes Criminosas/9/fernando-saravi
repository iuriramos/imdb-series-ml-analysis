I like cop series, CSI, etc. Recently I began to watch Criminal Minds, from the first season, and I really love it. Unlike other series (like The Big Bang Theory) I like how the characters evolve in Criminal Minds. The newest episode I have watched is Entropy. All the characters are attractive, even with their peculiarities. Dr. Reid is lovable (so says my wife) but each of them has something special. Of course, the cases they investigate are complex and it is interesting how they combine CSI data with their combined profiling of both the unknown subject and his or her victims and, of course, the informatics magic of Penelope to close the net around the unknown subject. I particularly enjoy when the initial profile is wrong and makes them to think hard about any missing clue until they get it straight. Highly recommended!
