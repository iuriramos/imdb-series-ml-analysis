Criminal Minds is one of the best procedural crime shows on TV. It's mostly self contained episodes without a serial element to the show which normally isn't my favorite way to do a drama type of show but it works great here. The show is about the FBI BAU(Behavorial Analysis Unit), in other words they investigate cases involving serial killers only. They're not investigating just simple murderers who only commit murder once out of a moment of rage, but people whose very nature makes them want to kill repeatedly. The team goes all over the country with the help of local law enforcement trying to hunt down these predators. The show has a great cast headlined by Thomas Gibson and Joe Mantegna.
