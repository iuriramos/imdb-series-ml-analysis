Pilot episode is a shocker and throws you into the world of the Behavioral Analysis Unit. From there every episode has you on the edge of your seat.

By Season 3 I stopped watching it for the profiles of the killers and was hooked on the characters.(But then again I could watch 1 hour of Shemar Moore just staring back at me from the TV and I'd be happy). They are all so well developed you yearn for more hints of their lives outside the FBI.

By Season 6 they were the only thing keeping me watching, I don't know what happened to the brilliant writers of Seasons 1-3, they didn't reuse plots. They just stopped explaining the WHY behind the killers behaviors and just focused on the HOWS. I was left at the end of episodes going "But..why would he do that?" Now I'm on season 7 and I have to say I'm VERY happy. Seems the writers woke back up. The plots are just as good as the report of the team and the characters side stories now. I'm back to being hooked.

All and all a great show, brings a COMPLETELY different view to the regular cop shows. I love the twists, the facts, how they breakdown the case by studying just the killers behaviors.

GOOD SHOW. Worth the watch.

...Did I mention Shemar Moore?
