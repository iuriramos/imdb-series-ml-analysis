I have loved this series since it started and it's just gotten better with time. The characters are whole people, they bring their private lives and past experiences into their work and this makes them relatable. They aren't detached and objective about everything so you get drawn into the cases with them. This series is very different from the other crime dramas because while they look at the crime itself and physical evidence with a focus on getting a conviction at trial, the BAU look at who the criminal is and aim to prevent there being more victims. You may never know the out come of the trial or even what happens after the arrest is made, but you know who committed the crime and sometimes you might even find out why.

The only small criticism I have is that having watched 6 series back to back, the American misunderstanding of English killers is really beginning to irritate. For example, talking about the Krays as a killing team in comparison with gang related violence, the Kray twins where the heads of a London gang, therefore the crimes they committed were gang related. And labeling Jack the Ripper as a sexual sadist when most of the profile doesn't fit the facts of the Ripper case. I realise this is past pedantic considering the length of the series and the general factual accuracy, but as a Brit I feel that if they are going to use British cases as examples they should research them properly.
