What makes criminal minds special is that every main character has an own, well developed personality. Nothing is more boring then to watch some guys who solve crimes but obviously don't have anything else they exist for, so when the case is solved they just disappear until the next one comes up. Of course, the main part of every episode of criminal minds is dedicated to the crime or rather the criminal the BAU has to work on this time, but there is often time for interaction between the team members or insight in someones mind. This series doesn't forget to show some of the emotional effects this kind of work no doubt has. Unfortunately, I haven't seen any episode of season 4 yet (Germany is always 1 year behind) and I didn't like a few things about season 3, but that doesn't change that this is the only crime drama of which I don't miss a single episode.
