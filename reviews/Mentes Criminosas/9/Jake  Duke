It dives into the deepest and darkest places of the human mind and helps take a shot at understanding why criminals do what they do. Diving into the 'Criminal Minds' and trying to understand them is the only way to apprehend or better yet prevent criminals. Although the reliability of the science of Profiling is debated it is implemented in reality by authorities of various countries. This show unlike many other crime based shows is not focused on how the characters react to the unfolding of events rather how the characters anticipate and unfold the events on board before they really unfold thus getting ahead of the criminals. In spite of the premise being rather grim, the show continues to maintain a story- line of the life of the lead characters in it. In addition, every episode has quotes by great thinkers to neatly sum up that episode which often makes you have a brain orgasm. The show does seem to get a bit repetitive if you binge on it, but it's perfect for a once a week watch. Although the members of the elite team understand the human mind better than most thus assumed to be above most of what normal people feel, they're all shown to have flaws, feelings and a bit of pettiness in them, making them believable and very much relatable.
