I've just started watching this show and by the time the Pilot was done, I was hooked. The witty lines and amazingly suspense plots work together like two pieces of a puzzle. Even though I'm only on my second season, at the moment, I already call this one of my favorite shows. I literally sitting on edge as i watch and gasp at the cliffhanger. The writers always leave me craving for more and I'm really glad i don't have school anymore because I would probably have fallen asleep during ever class since I practically spend all night watching more Criminal Minds than any sane person should. To say I love the show would be putting it too lightly but it's the best word I have for now.
