Overall I still love the show. It is reminding me how I still don't like the Rossi character. Not sure if it's because of Montegna or his character, probably both. Came on too brash, took over from day one.

Just not the same as with Gideon. He was the analytical one with the even temper. Still miss Paget Brewster/Emily Prentiss. Hewitt has also seemed to have changed the production also. Though even for me sometimes the blood and gore was too much, it still is/was an important part of why the team was in the first place. now it seems too tame by comparison.

Now I read Montegna is infusing his personal agenda. That keeps happening they will loose me after 9 plus years.
