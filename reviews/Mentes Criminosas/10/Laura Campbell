I absolutely love this show - I've always been into things like psychology and criminology and finally - a show that incorporates both with a fantastic cast! The plot lines are amazing and the characters relationships are brilliant. Dr Reid is one of the best characters I've seen for a while, he's just an infinite bank of random knowledge - and we always get a laugh from some of the things he says - like in the episode where he volunteered to go onto the train to help Elle and the other hostages - they've prepped him and he says "Do me a favour - can at least one of you look like you're going to see me again?" I also love Garcia - think she's hilarious! The second series isn't airing here yet (they're re-running series one) so I'm counting the days! Fantastic series - has completely outrun CSI in my books!
