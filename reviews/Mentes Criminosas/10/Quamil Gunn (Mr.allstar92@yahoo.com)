I love criminal minds I love the mystery and suspense involved in it. I love the fact that it's a unique cop show that brings something different to display how criminals are caught and how the mind of the criminal explains the motive for killing. I love the acting and the actors/ actresses its and amazing and outstanding show that I hope can continue with its profound success and hopefully to make it to see at least 16 seasons I would love to see that. Its my second favorite cop show after CSI:NY but it definitely has proved to be able to compete with others and its truly the best current cop show on television in my opinion. Nothing gets better than Criminal minds because its so different that's what makes it so great and the story lines and plots are just astonishing i hope that criminal minds continues
