Criminal Minds is the best show ever. I was hooked from the very first time it was advertised on TV. Then after watching the first show I knew this would be my all time favorite show. Im a big fan of the show years ago "The Profiler" I loved Sam and the team but I must say that Criminal Minds is even better. I love the whole team everyone has their own style of what they do and how they do it. Every show just has me on the edge of my seat and waitng till the next show. I just cant say enough good things about this show and the members on it. I sure hope that it stays on for a very long time. I love it!!!! Please keep this show going on and on.
