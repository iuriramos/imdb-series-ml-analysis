This is one of the best shows on television and here's why: Profiling: Profiling serial killers and other psychopathic criminals is an absolutely fascinating science and every episode is like an entertaining 101 in criminal psychology.

Writers: The writers on Criminal Minds are the champions of scripting realistic story lines that (unlike many other shows on television)does not always have happy endings. What makes Criminal Minds so good is that rather than making the characters emotionally superhuman we get a real take on how a job like theirs really affects the human psyche and how normal people go on doing a job like that.

The viewer also gets more up and personal with the killer because unlike, say, NCIS, we get to know the killer more intimately because of the profile. Which is a very interesting aspect to the show.

The cast/characters: Hotch, Rossi, Reid, Morgan, JJ, Prentis and Penelope Garcia form the perfect unit and without one of them the show wouldn't be the same, as shown by the outcry from fans all over the world when both AJ Cook (JJ) and Paget Brewster (Emily Prentiss) were forced to leave the show during the shows sixth season.

In closing I would just like to urge anyone who hasn't already checked out Criminal Minds to do so. Just make sure that you don't have plans for the rest of the week because you will be transfixed, go out and buy all seasons on DVD and forget that there's a world outside of your living room. Consider yourself warned...
