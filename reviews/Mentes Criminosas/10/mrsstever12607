I've been a fan of Shemar Moore since I was a little girl watching him on Young and the Restless. He was my first celeb crush, so when I heard that he was going to be back on television, I was excited and knew I had to watch it. Plus, the idea of going in the mind of a psycho and figuring out what he does and why was an intriguing show idea. So, I made my husband watch it with me, and we both love it! I love how each show has a quote at the beginning/end of the show. Plus, this show never ceases to amaze me. It frightens me sometimes, because this is real life. The characters are amazing, although I was quite sad to see the character of Gideon go... he is missed!! I've even gotten my co-workers watching it, and they are hooked!! Great show!! I love it! I hope this show is on for a long run!
