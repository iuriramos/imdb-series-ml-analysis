My mom & I just love this show. It's quite fascinating when you think about the severity of the crime investigated as well as the aspects of the mind of the "unsub" that make them commit the crime in the first place. Some of the reviews I've seen for this show say that it's sort of like CSI. I would have to disagree on account that, yes, both shows deal with crime, but CSI only goes into the crime scene and evidence (which is interesting in and of itself), while Criminal Minds focuses on the suspect and the reasons (some of which are kind of sickening to think about) behind their actions. Besides all that, all the characters are superb, especially Gideon, Hotch, Garcia, Morgan, & Reid (the last two are my mom's and my favorite characters). There are some episodes in this show that require a good stomach, as well as a open & sound mind . . . so be prepared!
