I have always been a huge fan of Shemar Moore's abs. Ever since he was on a soap opera!! But funny what a few years will do to a girl. I've always liked the smart guy, but gone out with guys like Shemar. And imagine, I'm still single.... Now days I am so crazy giddy over Reid! Every time he is on I am totally listening to what he says, because it's funny! He' so smart he's almost socially retarded, but for some reason I find myself thinking, "I've got to get me one of those." None of my friends agree. I need some support here. Anyone else??? Beyond this, this is an amazing show. I didn't start watching it right at the beginning, so I am looking forward to the repeats until mid-January.
