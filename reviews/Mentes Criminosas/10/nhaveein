I've watched NCIS, NCIS LA, NCIS New Orleans, Chicago PD, Flashpoint, Stalker, CSI and many other cop shows, but Criminal Minds is definitely unique. Just the "profiling" is so interesting that it has me hooked on the series to this day. From 2005 to now, it's been 10 years and no other show can beat Criminal Minds. I really miss Paget being part of the cast as her character, Prentiss, was one loved by all. When they took her off, Criminal Minds did change as she played a vital role in the show. But, I'm glad they chose to keep the character alive, allowing Prentiss to return any day. Criminal Minds has everything. From the tech nerd Garcia to the genius Reid to Rossi who's been married more than five times. If you watch just one episode, you'll be begging for more. That's the reaction only the best shows have and the best of them all is for sure, Criminal Minds.
