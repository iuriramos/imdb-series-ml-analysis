Really a great ensemble show with character and heart as the seven leads show also that they are not one-dimensional characters.

They have come and gone like Mandy Pantakin, Paget Brewster, and Lola Glaudini and have them replaced with Jeanne Tripplehorn but still the show's characters really are great in the ensemble.

Think when Joe Mantegna come on in, the show began to have an ensemble feel. Like Pantakin a lot but really love Mantegna after getting used to him after a long while.

The show focuses on the serial killers most of all, and worst of the worst. As the BAU the Behavior Analaysis Unit of the FBI comes in and the local authorities call them in. With the BAU helping and teaching them what the cities they go in, can expect.

As really it is a nice surprise to see them working together and no jurisdiction turf wars as that is very rare for a show like CM.

As they are forced to find the Unsubs as they called them before they strike again. It also shows them as humans with emotions. Not buttoned up people like Hollywood does with the feds or arrogant. And shows their family lives as well.

Great show, great writing, and great acting!
