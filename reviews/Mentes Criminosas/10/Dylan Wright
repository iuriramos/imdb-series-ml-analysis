Before watching this television series, I had no interest in Behavorial Analysis Unit of the FBI, now I am obsessed and possibly getting a career in it somehow. This show is one of the best shows currently running on television, of course besides "Dexter" but it's not on Season right now. I guarantee you Reid will move you, Hotchner's genius will stun you, Gideon's insight is unbelievable. This show makes you believe, almost like it's real. Amazing show I give 10 out of 10 I have a quantity of episodes stored up on my DVR =] But if you ever get the chance to see this show take it because I am almost positive that you will take up with it like me and my whole family did lol, so ya take this review to heart and tune to CBS and A and E on Fridays and Saturdays and lounge and watch the best show running, even if you do run in to some reruns.
