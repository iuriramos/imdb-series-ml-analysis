In my opinion, Criminal Minds is, currently, the best show on television.

An avid fan of crime drama, I started watching Criminal Minds when it aired for the first time in 2005. Unlike shows such as CSI, Criminal Minds delivers a psychological aspect to each episode. By profiling the "unsub" in each case, the BAU team predicts the criminal's next move. Anyone who has taken a psychology class will be amazed by all of the elements this show contains.

If you have never watched Criminal Minds, I highly recommend you give it a chance!
