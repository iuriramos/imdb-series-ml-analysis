CBS was the most watched channel on TV while Criminal Minds of old was still one of your top shows. I just subscribed to Netflix so I could start from the beginning and watch all of the shows that Derek Morgan was in. Even though all of the shows were amazing, the greatest to me were: when Emily returned, the devastation of Hodge losing his wife, Rossi found out he had a daughter, when Reed survived his capture, JJ survived her capture etc. but the most amazing of all was the Derek Trilogy, Season 11, Show 16- Derek, Show 17-The Sandman and Show 18, A Beautiful Disaster. The show has not and will not be the same without Derek. He is the handsome knight that every show needs to captivate its' audience. The show is not the same without him. I loved the Tribute with Emily's return and the one with Rossi's wife returning but the "family" is not the same without Derek. We want to see the baby grow up and him protecting them constantly at all cost. We know he just married so if that is the problem, give his wife a part on the show. If he wants to be in movies too, give him a dual contract where he can do both. We don't care what you have to do but you MUST get Derek back on Criminal Minds before the new season starts. There are MILLIONS like me out here that feel the same way. Pleaseeeeeee
