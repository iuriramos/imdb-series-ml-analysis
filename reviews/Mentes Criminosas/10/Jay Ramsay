I was a bit late to party with Criminal Minds, I only started watching it about a month ago and have already seen all 8 seasons. From the first episode I was hooked, a combination of story telling and characters made this show very enjoyable. I just hope this show continues to get the credit it deserves and I'm crossing my fingers for many more seasons.

The storytelling - Very well written, especially the first four or five season. The later seasons are still very good though.

The characters - I think this is the best part about this show. All the characters are very memorable, good guys and bad. Each character has a very distinct personality which lacks from a lot of other shows.

I have recommended this to friends and recommend to anyone reading this that might be contemplating whether or not they are going to take the dive. It will hook you straight away.
