Hello there! This TV Show is enticing and challenging like a puzzle in each episode. With time passing by the characters of the Criminal Minds are becoming more solid and better. As a boss, Aaron Hotchner, acts like an old-fashioned supervisor but he is fair and caring with his own people. Sometimes I cannot follow when Dr. Spencer Reid speaks but I know there are people like him. For my point of view, Jennifer Jareau and David Rossi can be added I little more substances on their personages. JJ can be more active in the field and David Rossi more involve in solves the cases since he is one of the people that came up in the idea of BAU. I love the friendship between Penelope Garcia and Derek Morgan. For me, what makes the TV Show worth to watch is the team work. Unfortunately, in the real world we don't see that often. I always like the newcomers but I miss Emily Prentiss character. I am looking for to see what comes next.
