Criminal Minds is by far THE BEST TV SHOW.

Criminal minds is one of those realistic as it gets Criminal Chasing TV show's. Whenever you watch Dr Reed and the team put a profile together.. its breath taking. This is one of those show's you just don't want to stop watching. I overall recommend this to anyone that enjoys watching criminal chasing TV shows with TOP OF THE CLASS so to speak characters. They are all extremely professional. Unlike these other TV shows with wanna be THUGS. 10/10 rating. 10 star.

Mathew Gubler and Thomas Gibson put on the best performance, every episode Over and over.. This is one of those show's that never disappoints. Gibson is the ultimate team leader, this guy could never get replaced, and Mathew Gubler i would have to admit is one of my top TV show actors out, his performance in Criminal Minds.. is Superb. Without these two characters.. Well let's just say I know MANY people that would not watch the show.
