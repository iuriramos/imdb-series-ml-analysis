The writing is superb. The acting is amazing and the cast is top notch. Although I must admit the story line at the moment with the character of Dr. Spencer Reed (My favorite)is very depressing. I hate the story lines of drug use because they are just so over used and go far to long as story arcs. They drag literally and figuratively. But back to the point give the show a chance it will be well worth you time. It's rare when you find a show with so many good characters. There are some weak links but they only seem that way because the others are just so phenomenal. The comedy of the show is executed by the delightful Penelope Garsea the team's residing tech. The afore mentioned Dr. Spencer Reed is the coolest geek out there. It was startling at first to see Thomas Gibbson of Dharma & Greg to be playing a cold indifferent Aaron "Hotch" Hotchner but he's still very likable. I especially enjoy the character of Derick Morgan. Portrayed by Shemare Moore (The Young and the Restles). I'm so glad to see he made it to a show that's just as exceptional as he is. (Not putting down the soap but I'm a guy and we don't watch soaps...often.) Jason Giddian is the head of this little team and he's often enjoyable to watch, I just don't watch it for him. But still good acting. The other two characters are of a different sorts. They are the women and they are the eye candy. I just wish they would beef up their parts and give them a little more depth than they do but still I'm not complaining. J.J. is the person who deals with the media...mostly they've started to give her more to do. And the newest addition to the team. Emily, the raven haired beauty she hasn't been on much but there is definite potential. Over all just watch the show you won't regret it. Promise.
