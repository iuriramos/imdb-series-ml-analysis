I must say, this is one of my favorite TV shows. I look forward to 'catching up' with the BAU every week. The script is well written, and the characters balance each other out just perfectly. 

Love the dynamic between Morgan and Garcia, and love Spencer's character!

Hodge is also great, as is Rossi. 

Morgan kicking down doors cracks me up every time, no wasted bullets there! 

Want to see more new episodes (I've seen pretty much all episodes from the 8 seasons to date) =D
