This show was made for us. It isn't full of pathetic drama or anything like that it's just real drama with really cool twists. Criminal Minds is dedicated to making this a realistic programme, they actually research what they put on the screen!! The director/producer also focuses on the backgrounds of the characters, but not so much that you get confused with what is actually happening in the real story. The actors on Criminal Minds are very believable Matthew Gray-Gubler, Shemar Moore, AJ Cook, Mandy Pantikin, Thomas Gibson, Paget Brewster, Kirsten Vangsness and Joe Mantegna are all awesome actors/actresses.

We love Criminal Minds! The End.
