In the wake of all the recent spin-offs of cop shows such as CSI and Law and Order, I was apprehensive when first tuning in to Criminal Minds. I expected another detective show full of gruesome murders and images of bloody corpses that leave nothing to the imagination and whose only device seems to be to completely gross out viewers. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not one such show. Criminal Minds is clever; the plots never fail to intrigue, and those clever writer keep you guessing to the very end. It's always interesting to see what tricks the profilers use to get inside the mind of the perpetrator, and the ways in which they gain the trust of the perp in order to get a conviction. The characters are interesting, extremely intelligent, witty, complex, and very good at what they do. "Criminal Minds" will pull you in from the very start and keep you drawn in and on the edge of your seat until the very end. A great watch, I highly recommend it.
