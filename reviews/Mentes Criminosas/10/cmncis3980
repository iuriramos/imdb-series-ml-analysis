I've been watching CM since i believe Summer of 09. One day I was just channel surfing and I stopped when I saw this cut guy on the screen. It was of course Reid who I saw. It was the end scene of Conflicted, with Reid and Morgan on the roof.Ever since that day I have watched CM. I own almost all the seasons. I'm in the process of getting season 7.

I have a favorite episode for every season. But my all time favorite episode is, Season Five Episode One, Nameless Faceless. I just love Reid in this episode. He's so brave.

My least favorite would have to be Revelations. I can't stand the torture Reid is out through. It's so painful to watch. I force myself to watch it every time it's on in attempt to not cringe at what's going on. But I fail each time.

I write a lot if fanfiction about CM. https:// m.fanfiction.net/u/4359991 this is the link to my stories is you are interested in reading them. All of them are Reid ones though. He's the only character I write about
