This show is amazing, it has the best graphics any show I have ever watched! It always keeps me on my toes and wanting, no scratch that, needing more! Derek Morgan is hot as ever and makes me wish guys talked to me like he does Penelope Garcia. Dr. Spencer Reid never seems to bore me with his length of knowledge at a very young age. JJ is beautiful and has the most adorable kid ever. Kate Callahan is mind blowing with her knowledge in the undercover part of the FBI. Aaron Hotchner is a hard-ass as ever with keeping the gang in order and I like being able to see how he is with his kid,Jack. Penelope is gorgeous ans shows that you can be blonde and have brains and do amazing things in life!I miss Emily Prentiss the most because of the banter between Derek and her.David Rossi is a bad-ass and has a every soothing voice to listen too. This team of Agents makes what they do seem easy but its not. In Shemar Moore word's : Kicking some bad guys butts!
