Im a massive fan of Criminal minds. Ever since it came on TV, i've watched it. I've never missed an episode. I love how the characters at the start that I didn't like left. Like the girl before Emily - she just wasn't suited for the role. And Gideon. I didn't like him. And then Rossi and Emily came in. I loved Rossi right from the start, he fitted in better. And Emily is okay. Also its really good because the cast has had no major changes like other shows. And the cast look like their best friends off set, which is really good to see Criminal Minds also i for a little comedy. Like with Spencer not knowing what Twilight is. Another reason why i love this show is that how they go about finding the killers. Its like real life.
