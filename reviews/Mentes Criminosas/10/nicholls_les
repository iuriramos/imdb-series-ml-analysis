Everything about this show is good, really good.

The story lines are clever and believable and the characters are perfect.

Thomas Gibson is brilliant and holds the whole team together as Aaron Hotchner and Joe Mantegna as David Rossi is another great character.

But then there is the amazingly good Matthew Gray Gubler as the weird and wonderful Dr. Spencer Reid and Shemar Moore as Derek Morgan shows that a black man can have a major part that isn't as a black man ( so many films stereo type black actors and this is a refreshing change)

Jennifer Jareau played by A.J Cook is another well rounded character but then there is the brilliant Kirsten Vangsness as Penelope Garcia I miss Mandy Patinkin as Jason Gideon as his character was a lynch pin for the early episodes.

The only character I didn't really like was Erin Strauss played by Jayne Atkinson. I felt that those episodes were more like a soap opera and Criminal minds was better than that.

So pleased that this show is continuing and look forward to many more.
