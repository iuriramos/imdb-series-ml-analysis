This i have to say is the most addicting movie/series i have ever watched.2nd's would have to be Reba(series) and cheaper by the dozen 2(movie). I Think it is a great series and after watching one i have watched everyone since. It is just an amazing series. I think everyone should watch it it caters for a lot of different people. It was excellent amazing i really cant think of any words that are good enough to say. I just finished watching so yeah.... This is on, Thursday's in New Zealand on channel one 8.30-8.30. Thats the only country i know so yeah. And this is a different subject, but i think the rule that the comment has to be 10 lines is rather stupid because otherwise people have to ramble on like i am. so i am going to summarize i think that the series Criminal minds is really cool and that everyone should at least try it.
