I will say just 2 things. I love the show and I have a terrible crush on Reid and I am 60 years old. He sure wakes up something that has been asleep for a while.I feel like a cradle robber. OK I will say more. I don't get the people who say that this show is like CSI or any of those other crime shows that are on now. It is so totally different. It makes me feel different. I am trying to think of a way to explain the difference in Criminal Minds and other crime shows. I guess that it is more serious not so much about the characters lives. I mean there is some insight into their lives but not getting into a mushy relationship with someone or like that. It is great and they should just leave it alone.Just don't lose Reid!
