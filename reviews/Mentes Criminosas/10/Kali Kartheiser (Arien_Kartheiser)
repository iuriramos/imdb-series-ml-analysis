I discovered this show after a long while, at the end of season 4, there was something so compelling on the cases, that I HAD to watch from the first season, And not only Mandy Patinkin, there's something, maybe that the show is not about utterly complicated love lives among the characters, is not cheapened with gratuitous sex scenes or nudity, not even as much Gore as they could use, but there's something about this "heroes" that feels just right.

This show has characters written and developed in so many layers that you notice flaws and scars, and the interaction among them is so realistic that it could be the same interaction among the actors just reflected in the acting, translated in how comfortable the group looks with each other and how you see the grief in them when one of the group leaves.

The cases are weird, twisted and leave a bitter taste in your mouth at the end, there's no happy ending every time, they shows us victims, make us like them and then kill them, and the audience has to suffer the loss, not a bad thing, because they actually make you understand what kind of monsters normal/regular humans can be. Even this season (6th) being the weakest has moments of brilliancy, they exploit not only the always intriguing serial killers, but use the most common fears, those threats that we all live with.

I thought it'll be another CSI/NCIS/Without a trace show, but is different, the acting even if not recognized with at least award nominations is excellent, the writing is worthy of your time, and the quotes they use at the beginning and the end of every episode gives you a little extra that some shows are trying to copy. I like this show very much, and I enjoy it as much as I enjoy other shows Like X-Files.
