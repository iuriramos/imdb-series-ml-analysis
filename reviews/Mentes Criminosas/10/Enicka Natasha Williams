WOW, This summer I moved from Fort Leonard Wood Missouri to Fort Lewis Washington and this show became my Obsession. Being in the Military I hardly ever watch T.V.but during the move and taking leave I did. I watch every episode in the space of 3 weeks by using DVR and DVD. What prompted me to write this review is this weeks episode. I cried at the end. I'm a single mom and it had me thinking about what if I were to put myself in that mothers shoes. WOW, it was moving. In the end when she came back and thanked the team for believing in her was rare. Sometimes Thank you isn't enough in this world, and that true. I always walk away learning something from your show. Whether its not leaving the Middle door to the Garage unlocked or so many more. Well, I look forward to the next episode. Thanks for a great show. I use to be an active Law and Order SVU fan but your show took over by far.
