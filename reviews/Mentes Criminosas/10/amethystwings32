I love this show, and Iam so glad that they kept it. I really fought to keep it,I like the cast a lot. My favorite character is Reid, because he reminds me of myself. His life is a lot like mine in many ways. His torment is a lot like mine, from his mother's madness to not knowing if he will end up like her; going mad. That is my mom's take on the hit suspense drama! Mine is , I too love this show . It is intense, suspenseful and it shows the ugliness of human nature. And inhumanity in this world! And in a way I can relate to his character in different aspects. Of his life, all and all this is what good drama is all about. Drama, the human elements, suspense . Though due to content and violence this show is not for everyone! But if you love a crime show this is a must see!
