Dear Criminal Minds I am a mom of a daughter that is getting married on Sept 6th 2014 she is an avid fan of the show Criminal Minds. Her and I watch this when we need mom time and curl up in blankets in front of the TV on a cold winter day. We live in Saskatchewan Canada. Cold as Hell here in winter. Nadia is her name and she is marrying Tyler from a small town in Saskatchewan. My request if getting a greeting from the cast to the both of them for their wedding day. This may sound weird to you but I always think that in 25 years you look back and the Criminal Minds cast will stand out. Nadia And Tyler are very special and they both love Criminal Mind. I thank you for reading this and I would love a card with a greeting sent to me to give to them. My address is Cathy Feld box 292 Shell Lake Saskatchewan Canada s0j-2g0 Thank you
