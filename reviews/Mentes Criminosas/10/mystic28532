I have been addicted to CM since it started and its the one of the only shows I watch on regular TV. Once you follow the cast they become part of your family. This show also has great writers and great producers. I look forward to watching every Wed night when it is on and every day I watch reruns on ION. I can't get enough of this show even though I have seen all of them many times before. Please don't change it up to much as it works as it is. I don't care for reality shows and CM is worth watching. Hope to continue watching. Thanks to all involved creating this wonderful show. I will continue to watch as it is worth it. on another note I understand Morgan's reason for leaving the show and I wish him luck. How about Bill Pullman to replace the boss.
