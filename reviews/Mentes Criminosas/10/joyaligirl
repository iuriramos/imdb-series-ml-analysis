This series is so close to the real thing, The main characters are great. We all love Garcia, JJ is amazing, Reid is unique, Gideon is intense as is Hutchner, I love them all. The story lines are excellent, I have read quite a lot of true crime and the writer is doing an excellent job creating these serial killers. I have series linked this show which I do not do often. There are not too many series that are worth watching every week but this one is. I actually cried when Reid's girlfriend was shot. We all like some real in amongst the fiction and the writer and actors have manged to do this extremely well. I never write reviews, this is a first, so well done and keep up the suspense.
