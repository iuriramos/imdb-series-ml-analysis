Criminal Minds is one of those addicting shows on TV right now. More fun to watch it on DVD with absolutely no interruptions from commercials. Out of all the crime beat shows we have Â– CSI, NCIS, L&O, etc. this one is my favorite. The acting is superb and convincing. I like the portrayal of a team of profilers that catches the bad guys. For problem solving at that level, you need a team of expertise. I've watched the series from the beginning and at times I do miss the characters Gideon and Elle but their replacements Rossi and Prentiss do a fine job with the group chemistry dynamic.

I give much credit to the writers of the show to venture into such dark matters of human nature and how sick people can be. Even with this main topic that weaves throughout the series, there's a careful character pacing with each of the profilers that is believable, something which does not entirely translate as well on the other TV shows mentioned. I appreciate how the show stays relevant to real time, like with episode "the internet is forever." Social media network with an evil purpose was never more fascinating and engaging. The episode had excellent twists. I also appreciate the famous quotes on each episode. I look forward to the upcoming season and the conclusion to last season's finale.

I highly recommend this TV series.
