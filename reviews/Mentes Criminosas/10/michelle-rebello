Absolutely brilliant, best show on TV, I couldn't sing its praises more, characters are excellent, so are the actors, absolutely brilliant to watch the characters and plots come together & unfold.

Criminal Minds is like mini psychological thriller movies, that holds & demands your undivided attention, absolutely love it and hang out to watch it each week. If that wasn't enough I now own the first three seasons on DVD the only TV series I own and that's saying a lot!! 

The dynamic between the cast is excellent, the actors are brilliant absolutely love them all and hope they stay on for many more seasons. Although I must admit I loved and miss Gideon & Mandy Patinkin, so wish he would come back to the show. Rossi is great but miss Gideon!

If you love action & thrillers then this is the show for you, keeps you guessing Â… 10/10 - Excellent! Excellent! Excellent
