I'm 16 now but i have been watching criminal minds for three years and i have seen pretty much all episodes,and your probably thinking she don't get out but i manage to still watch em cause i record them all :L cant wait for more new episodes & for someone my age you wouldn't expect me to watch them but they are the nuts and i learn a lot from this :) make sure you don't change any of the characters cause it would not be the same if you do and maybe you should get couple kid actors/actresses to play Hotchner's son or daughter and they get into trouble with the 'unsub' it will make it more interesting! and don't do so many adverts, its a pain having to fast forward all the time LoL........ if ya need me email me, i might be good for that part ;) From D.B (U.K)
