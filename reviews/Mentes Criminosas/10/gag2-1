As a new viewer of "Criminal Minds", I wonder where I was when this excellent series began last year! I started watching about a month ago, and am totally hooked. This is finally something to view other than gruesome dissecting of bodies while trying to down a hamburger during dinner hour. 

"Criminal Minds" challenges the mind, which a senior citizen like myself needs in high doses. It offers entertainment from a superb cast. How nice to see Thomas Gibson in a role that seems to better meet his talents. I would like to see more forcefulness from Hotch as the show continues. More blend of each character's strong profiling ability, along with just enough "personal life" added to spice their roles should be a winning formula for a hopefully long-running, exciting series.

As for the great writing, plots, action, dialog, cast (all of them)...the series will be difficult to surpass. My order is already in for the First Season DVD.
