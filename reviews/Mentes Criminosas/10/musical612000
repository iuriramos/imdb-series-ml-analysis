I happened upon this show out of curiosity as I had that channel on while awaiting CSI NY, and I must say, it blew me away! Another comment had been made about the darkness about this show, and I have to agree- yes, the unsubs are dark and the crimes ghastly but that is just how some of these criminals are hard wired. I like all the characters, Rossi is great, but I loved Gideon. After watching this on A&E on Friday nights I came to the conclusion that I wouldn't want to be one of the BAU's relatives- they would be able to read write through you and get in your head, so it would be hard to hide anything from them,lol. I was hooked on the CSI franchise for awhile, but after a while the way they air those things you pretty much know the script as well as the actors. Even if I have seen these as reruns, the psychology of the unsubs makes you feel like when they look into the villains its like looking into that dark room that always made one wary to enter as a child. I recently watched some older episodes online and in spite of seeing them in the past, I was still looking at the story unfold like' that **** is dark and spooky. I highly recommend it to anyone who not only likes a good who done it but the 'why' as well. It can hold its own with any movie I have watched as of late.( spoilers ahead) For instance, catch the episodes about Frank and it will show you a look into how bent the criminal minds can be as well as just what in their past can set them off. Great show! i give it a 10!
