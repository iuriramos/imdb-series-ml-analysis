What can I say? How to even start? Definitely one of the best series I've ever watched and I watched a lot of them, believe me. I maybe can't afford it and say that this is the best series i ever watched, but I can definitely afford myself to say that this is the best crime series ever filmed. I literally watched the series, all 10 seasons in perhaps a month or two. I just couldn't keep away from them. Chemistry between the characters is amazing, and the characters are so well designed that each character is special and mysterious in its own way. Simply delight awaits you from episode to episode. So many trades, so many new fantastic evil characters and stories that will leave you breathless. With this series I laughed and cried. I don't know what words to use and are relevant to describe this phenomenal series and how to even describe this series, because honestly, hand on heart, this series can not be describe in words.
