I love Criminal Minds. The show has always got original plots, and always has you at the edge of you seat with new unsubs (unknown subject), on each episode, and sometimes returning unsubs that come for revenge! The best thing about it is, that it's not repetitive where they fight a new unsub every time, they also go on about the special agents' personal lives, bringing out the dramatic bits of the show. Getting us closer to the characters, who are amazing and they can really grow on you. They have the most talented cast playing the current main roles. 

The gruesome and exciting scenes, really has your adrenaline going. With really great special effects, helping the scenes look more realistic. Which is another brilliant thing about the show. Nothing is fake, everything that goes on the show, are things that can happen to people in real life! Then the crazy twists, really get you thinking.... "Did they catch him?" "Did she survive?". 

Criminal Minds, in my opinion, is the best TV series ever made, and I recommend this show to everyone!
