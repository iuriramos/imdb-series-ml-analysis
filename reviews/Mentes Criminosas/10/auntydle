This is my favorite show. Criminal Minds is one of the most intelligent shows on TV today. Like Profiler (1996-2000) and Un-Sub (1989) before it, Criminal Minds takes the psychology to a higher level than other crime dramas. 

I love the fact that the agents don't strut or posturize or act superior toward the local police. In most crime dramas, there are always conflicts between the local cops and FBI. In this show, they cooperate.

As sexy as Derek Morgan is, I prefer the un-macho, brainy types. So you can probably guess who my favorite character is. If you don't know, it's Reid.

The whole chemistry of the cast is great. Without a Trace is a good show, but can be a little stiff. NCIS has great chemistry, too. The Closer is my second favorite show, but it's very close. I don't watch any of the CSI shows.
