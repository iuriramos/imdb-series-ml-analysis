The person above should return to the third grade and get his diploma before attempting to write anything further. I'm just glad the show is not written by the likes of that person! Proof read your stuff, dude! Anyhoo, just because the clown above can't spell or compose worth a hoot don't let that stop you from tuning in. The only thing which will deter some people from watching in the future would be the absence of Lola Glaudini or "Elle". Guess she couldn't stand the smog in Los Angeles any more and split back to NY. Don't know it that is a winning or loosing proposition for her but she will definitely be missed by this viewer in particular. Oh well, think the show will survive but it will surely be a loss without her.
