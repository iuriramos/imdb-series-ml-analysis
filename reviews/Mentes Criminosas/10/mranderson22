This show is very similar to CSI but it is a bit more interesting and it really makes you wonder about what some criminals think and how they act. It is also very exciting and suspenseful! It has great acting, well developed characters and a great storyline. The best part about this show is when they put the profiles of the criminals together. One of the main characters will begin to give a speech on how the "unsub" (unknown subject)thinks and how he or she usually acts. They can tell if the unsub is social or not, what kind of job they have, why they commit the crime, and many other things. It is a very original show and is extremely exciting and suspenseful. If you want a new show to start watching and you like these kind of shows, you will love criminal minds.
