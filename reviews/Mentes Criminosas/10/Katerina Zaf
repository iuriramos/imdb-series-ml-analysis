Criminal Minds is one of the best series i have ever watched. The cases actually make you understand what kind of monsters humans can be. I enjoy watching this show because it isn't so predictable. Often the killer is someone I completely haven't guessed, which makes it a good watch. It's always interesting to see what tricks the profilers use to get inside the mind of the UnSub. This is one of the best crime shows, great acting and you begin to feel for all the characters. The main characters are great. I love Morgan and Garcia, Reid is unique. I have recommended this to friends and recommend to anyone reading this. I really enjoy this show, it is very interesting!!!!
