Honestly I've watched CM for years, it's always got a different twist and the stories are amazing. The 100th and 200th has me on the edge of my seat, and the acting to me is first class. Although when Paget left I never really found it the same but continued to watch hoping to warm to the new character. That was almost impossible so I hardly watched any of season 8, although I watched mostly every episode in season 9 because of the 200th episode airing and Pagets brief return. I was really glad at the way they brought her back, and it really showed the relationships between Emily and he rest of the team. Jeanne left at the end of season 9 so I am hoping that I'll enjoy it again, Jennifer Love Hewitt is said to be joining the BAU and after seeing her guest star in SVU and on the Client List I'm really looking forward to season 10, hopefully CM will continue to impress us and we'll see them celebrate the 300th episode.
