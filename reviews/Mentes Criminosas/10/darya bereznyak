This show is definitely a great watch! I've stuck with this show since season 1(episode 1) and its now at season 8! I really enjoy this show, it is very interesting, but the part of love the most is the chemistry amongst the cast!I feel like the writers/producers/directors could not have come up with a better cast. They are all very talented and lovable. My personal favorite is of course Dr Spencer Reid. Whoever is skeptical about the show, definitely should watch more than one episode to judge it! the actual cases that are presented are interesting, yet do make you think about what really is out there in this world. It is definitely a must watch!
