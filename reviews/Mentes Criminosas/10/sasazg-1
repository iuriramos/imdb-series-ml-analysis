I've been watching crime dramas practically all of may life, I've seen many different concepts of those shows, but I can honestly say that Criminal Minds are truly one of the best crime shows that were ever on television. The stories are interesting, the development of characters is great, you can see all those different personalities working together with the common goal of defining psychic potentials of criminals.

The most impressive episodes, I must say are the season 3 finale and the continuation of that episode in the first one of season 4. Those two episodes left me on the edge of my seat and I would say, action wise they are even better then many things we saw on 24 with Jack Bauer. I was thrilled and I will watch it a few more times just to see it again. I would recommend it to everyone.

Good luck to everyone!
