I've never had a favourite TV show or movie or even a favourite band. I've always been one of those people to have a 'favourite right now' show/movie/band. But this has converted me! I now have an all time favourite show! 

I randomly watched an episode a couple years ago while trying to kill an hr, and instantly got hooked. I went right out and bought the previous seasons and watched every episode back to back until I was caught up. 

From the amazing characters like Garcia and Reed, to the thrilling story lines that get you thinking, this show is incredible. It drags you in and won't let go. 

The best characters in my opinion are Garcia (because she's so talented and unique, and just has her own style and way of doing things). And Dr. Reed, I just love his quirkiness and he's like the little brother... I of course have a soft spot for JJ and Hotch as well. 

Overall, everyone should watch this show :)
