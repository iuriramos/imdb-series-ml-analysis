When I first saw this show (witch was with my friends), we just turned it on and started watching, we din't know much about this show, at first, I thought that it was another one of those cheesy cop shows, but in the end, I really liked it. I'd even say that this is better then all CSIs because it's a bit more realistic and the episodes are all very different, as for CSI, it's someone gets killed, someone finds the body and freaks out and calls the cops, the CSI team comes, they take the body and they exam it. They magically find something and they continue until they magically finds the real culprit. Criminal Minds is different, they play with the findings of the crimes, mainly because the crime isn't always someone dead. The people on the team are all very different (it's not all skinny nice-looking actors) for the actors, and perfect-life, stress free people, like the characters.

The team is constricted of peoples: Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin), the leader, the one who's the most experienced.

Aaron Hotch (Thomas Gibson), the boss Derek Morgan (Sheemar Moore), the crazy people profiler Elle Greennaway (Lola Glaudini), the sex-offended victims profiler.

Dr.Spencer Reid (Mathew Gray Gubler), the smart-ass genius who happens to know everything.

Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangness), the computer magician Jeniffer "JJ"

Jareau (A.J. Cook), I have no idea, she does not do much, she only talks to the press.

I Also prefer this show because this is a real organization (FBI) and not some made-up one (CSI), and they are actual cops.
