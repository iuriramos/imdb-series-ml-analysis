While this show had been good to me for many years, and would make a good show to marathon on Netflix, this show is simply trash police propaganda, as with all other shows such as this. I will never watch this show, or any show like this, again. While at one time it was good to me and good for me, it's plainly propaganda for the police and other hands of government that I want no part of. That negates anything else this show has to offer. This belongs in the trash and in the past, as do the rest of the shows like this. The acts shown and discussed in this show, the way they are presented for the maximum shock value, is disgusting. These acts don;t belong on television. They belong more in the realm of porn, or better yet, nowhere anywhere. Just reading, on sites such as TV Tropes, or thinking or remembering about what happens in this show, is horrific. Nothing in this show should be on any television.
