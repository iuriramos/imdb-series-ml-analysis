The acting is haphazard, the characters are one dimensional and loathsome, and the writing is predictable and trashy. I hate this show so much, the only reason I joined IMDb was to communicate to the world how odious this show is. Please, if it is remotely within your capacity, take this show off the air. If you have a positive view of the world, of humanity, the government, or the criminal justice system, do not watch this show. It not only communicates the sensationalized myth of the need for fear, but it also depicts public officials as sinister, self- righteous villains for whom if violence could ever be justified, it would be justified against the characters portrayed as protagonists in this show.
