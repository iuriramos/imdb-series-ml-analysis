In the past I liked it often, with the New York dark side and continuous relevant references, though of course solving every crime with the right culprit was always hard to bare. But now I'd say please ignore the worst police shows ever.

In the first episode of season 17 they took their story from Silence of the Lambs, with a psychopath that is willing to give information for benefits and only wants to meet the girl... Even the transvestite reference resembles Buffalo Bill, the transvestite psychopath wanting to be a woman, AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED THIS? They keep putting at least 5 cops on every small case including the lieutenant who has less tasks than a hot-dog vendor, while she constantly keeps hovering above the one investigation, SHE DOES NOT HAVE MORE THAN ONE CASE! This many cops does not compensate for cheap story lines, a soapy soundtrack and this fluffy story about crime on planet earth. I can't watch this anymore, nor can most people that can think, cancel this show already!
