In the dictionary of American TV jargon, this show is featured next to the phrase, "Jumped the shark". Here's why:

The last episode of the current season--Benson and the ADA (don't remember her name) perform a surgical procedure on the Medical Examiner while she's conscious and directing them, screeching in alleged pain, after the M.E. been shot in the chest.

Get real.

This travesty is clearly aiming for syndication on the Lifetime channel or Oxygen. Better to kill it off now and put us out of our misery.

Richard Belzer and Ice-T ought to have their own spin off show, but a comedy this time-- they'd be much more at home. This is not to say that they're not good at their craft, but simply that they've been given such wretched material over the run of the show. I could see them in their own "buddy cop" show--I might even watch it. 

The rest of them can rot in syndication, and Dann Florek can keep doing his gold commercials--apparently what he's paid for them has "never been worth zero". Unfortunately, this show has outlived its usefulness.

January 2012: I can't believe I'm writing this. Harry Connick Jr. has joined the cast as an "Executive Assistant to the DA". Isn't "Executive Assistant" an overpaid secretary? The first thing that sprang to mind after I saw him in character on screen was "Elvis movie". As a huge fan of Harry Connick's music, I am equally disappointed in his choice to take on this role. Stiff and stumbling don't even begin to describe it. Stick to jazz, Harry.
