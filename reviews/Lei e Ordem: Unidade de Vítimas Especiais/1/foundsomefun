All of the other Law & Order shows have had realistic cast changes except this one. It is the same old same old. Benson and Stabler go running around and grab the wrong person. Benson always looks like she smells rotten fish and Stabler roughs up the suspect. They catch the wrong person within the first 15 minutes and then the real person strikes again. Benson stands slack jawed with her tongue poking out of her mouth and Stabler looks insulted that he arrested the wrong person.

They are never held accountable for their mistakes and cop and attitude that they were wrong. The writing got so predictable a few years back.

Maybe I am just sick of seeing that face of Benson and Stabler all the time. It is funny... in the first season one of the characters makes a comment that because the job in SVU is so stressful that they have to rotate out after 2 years to keep their sanity. It stuck with me because I thought they were setting things up for frequent cast changes... BOY WAS I WRONG. I stories were interesting but not in the last couple of years. I miss the show when it was good.
