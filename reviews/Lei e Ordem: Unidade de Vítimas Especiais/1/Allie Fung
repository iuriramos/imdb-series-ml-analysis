I just finished watching "Turmoil" and I am aghast that those two have not been drummed out by the IAD. That squad has lost more detectives to "bad" behavior yet Stabler, especially him, continues to lose his mind and all manner of control in every situation, make terrible judgment calls and is basically a ticking time bomb every week. And can we figure out how to write some kind of dialogue that is appropriate to the job? Calling child rapists scumbags went the way of NYPD Blue and grossly inadequate. And can we stop nominating Mariska Hartigay for Emmys and Golden Globes? She's got only one expression that she uses for when she's confused by the evidence, taking a witness statement or placating "El" when he's gone off the deep end. I don't know why I continue to watch this freaking show. This is has gone the way of CSI:Miami. Straight up parody.
