L&O: SVU is by far the worst of the L&O franchise, and one of the worst shows ever to appear on TV, any network, any language: 

- It suffers from the late-MASH syndrome, where all minor characters have to have a part and are all buddy-buddy. 

- The writers can't use jargon without immediately defining its social meaning. Benson: "He's a pedophile." Ice-T: "Yeah, 32% of pedophiles rape kids under 8, yo, word."

- Mariska Hargitay has one basic expression: shocked horror. And what's with Benson's one cure-all for everything? Talk therapy. No, dear, some things should be bottled up and never spoken of again.

- They have something in for prep kids. What, was Dick Wolf turned down by the Philip Exeter Academy or something?

- It's a bizarre combination of far-left socializing plus far-right tactics, yielding an overall effect eerily reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution in China.

- Why is Richard Belzer on this show? Munch was a great character on Homicide. They don't write to either his character or the actor's capabilities at all.

- Are these cops supposed to be NYPD cops?! *NEW YORK?* Playing social worker? No. New York cops solve crimes, they don't play social worker. Victims are chumps, perps are prey. Bizarre.

- Where is the real "SVU" horror of the welfare mom in a roach-infested hovel starving the kids while hubby rapes them? It's an incredibly "clean" show.
