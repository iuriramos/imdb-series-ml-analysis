This show used to be OK, but over the last couple of years it has lost the plot. It demonizes all men. It portrays men as abusers, and women as victims. This is not the real world. Instead of a balance in drama that reflects our world, it's nothing more than ratings hype. My family are about to stop watching this show.

The departure of Elliot Stabler was a blessing. This man played a man hater. He was violent and should have been removed from the police force a long time ago. The new guy seems, so far, to have a more balanced approach to police work. Hope he stays that way!

It's disappointing that Dick Wolf and his associates have pushed the show down this draconian path. We have enough problems in society with men being discriminated against, the last thing we need is this sort of irresponsible TV reinforcing the false paradigms of our brainwashed society.

From an entertainment perspective, it just isn't. There are many more TV shows out there that have a better entertainment content. I gave this show a 2 because the new guy adds more character to the show than Stabler did.
