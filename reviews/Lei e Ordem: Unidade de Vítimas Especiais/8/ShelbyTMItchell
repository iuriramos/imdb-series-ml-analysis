May not be as great as the original. But this is more of a softer and gentler version. As it shows more personality and more caring. It is more like investigating sex crimes.

But for the record, in real life, they do not investigate homicides. As that is done by a separate division. The thing that we call Hollywood these days.

But anyway the mainstay is Mariska Hagriaty as Detective Olivia Benson as it seems to be her show. But miss Christopher Meloni's Detective Elliot Stabler.

Ice T and Richard Belzer also mainstays, are great as the comic reliefs and Dann Florek as Captain Cragan a gruff yet understanding father figure in the precinct.

More character wise balanced with the case. While the original was more story driven than character one. Still SVU is a great show!
