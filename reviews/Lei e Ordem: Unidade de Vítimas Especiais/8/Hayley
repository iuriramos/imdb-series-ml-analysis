I think the thing I like best about this show is the fact that the writers portray the characters as real people. Both Stabler and Benson have their flaws - they aren't depicted as perfect TV detectives who never put a foot wrong. They argue with each other, they have been put on probation before, they get told off by their boss - its easy to forget that these two, especially, are actors, not real people.

I also enjoy how we get to follow the cases to the courtroom - its more realistic than shows like CSI where once the detectives have caught the criminal, its implied that they get put away for a long, long time. However, SVU: Special Victims Unit is more realistic, in that although they have caught the criminal, there still remains a possibility that they criminal will be acquitted.

To conclude, I love this show and I definitely recommend it, especially if you are looking for a TV show with all the thrills of a detective show and a touch more realism.
