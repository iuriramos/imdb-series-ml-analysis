I have been watching this show lately and I am impressed by the performances of the actors. Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay provide a superb performance and make their characters very real. Ice T,Michel Belzer, Dann Florek, BD Wong and Tamara Munie also play their characters superbly. Each of them add credibility and realism to the show. The cases treated in the series are sometimes very gore and heartbreaking but that is what makes this show great.My only regret is that at the end 12 Stabbler is no more in the unit. I am more reserved about the performances of Danny Pino and Kelly Giddish which are no match for Christopher Meloni and their characters are more faded than the one played by Christopher Meloni which was an extremely ruthless tough as nails cop. Though the show is still very watchable and enjoyable.
