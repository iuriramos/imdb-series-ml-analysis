Great show, great cast. I'm happy to see Mariska Hargitay stick it out and stay with this series and become it's anchor. The stories still "borrow" from the headlines quite often but the writing and acting still manage to keep the viewer engrossed, time and time again. 

There's been some cast turnover through the years but despite the loss of the excellent Christopher Meloni, I've really come to like the new additions brought it, particularly Kelli Giddish as the transplant cop with a few skeletons in her closet. I'm sorry that Dick Wolf productions killed all of the other L&O franchise series but if one had to stay, this one's the best. A minor quibble though....I wish that the network wouldn't show 2 or 3 episodes and then revert to reruns so often before fresh stuff comes back on. What's up with that? It's also kind of funny to note that the writers (or D. Wolf himself) seem to dislike the name Kevin for some reason because, whenever a character has that name, he's either guilty as anything of the crime in question or a low life in general.The pattern of that specific name makes me wonder if a kid named Kevin gave Dick Wolf hell growing up and is this Wolf's (amusing) revenge, turning him into the dirt bag Dujour. Sorry for the ramble here....love the show and I hope it keeps going for years to come.
