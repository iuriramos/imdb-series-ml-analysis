Although the original Law and Order, imho, was a major yawner, SVU manages to capture my attention. I like the way this show gives the viewer some insight into the lives of the detectives and other main characters. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is because of the left-leaning bias of most of the shows that deal with controversial issues. Conservatives, whether politically or religiously, are usually portrayed as idiots or freaks who drive the perpetrators to commit their horrible crimes. As a writer myself, I know it is impossible to keep our own personal beliefs and biases from filtering into our writings. But a show that is played on national TV and probably in various other countries around the world, has a responsibility to be a little more fair in its portrayal of people of other beliefs. As it stands, L&O SVU is actually helping to foster hatred toward folks who happen to have more traditional views. I find this extremely irresponsible and disturbing at a time when conservatives such as anti-abortionists are being murdered in broad daylight simply for having the gall to make use of their first amendment right to freedom of speech. Tone down the anti-conservative agenda, and the show is one of the best police shows on TV.
