"Law & Order: Special Victim's Unit" accomplishes a particularly harrowing feat in under fifty minutes, and has been doing so over the course of it's nearly two hundred episodes. The show takes viewers deep within the underbelly of society, and presents storyline after storyline of highly dark and uncomfortably disturbing subject matter as the elite detectives of the Special Victim's Unit investigate one sex crime after another. Somehow the show remains exceedingly entertaining, whether due to the sharp, to-the-point writing, or the stoic, matter-of-fact performances by the talented cast, or maybe there's something more. Perhaps in whatever truth that surely lies in the story lines, there's a glimmer of hope that justice for malicious criminals can also be had in reality. Whatever the case, "Law & Order: Special Victim's Unit" is a consistent, if at times formulaic, adult drama.
