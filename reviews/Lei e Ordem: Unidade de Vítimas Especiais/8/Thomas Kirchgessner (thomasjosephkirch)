In general, what I think if this series is that it relates to what would really happen in the 'real world' instead of just a fictional made up bunch of crap that some people would just spit out for the ratings.

In everyday life, people lie, cheat, rape, murder, and assault others just for personal pleasure. Which, the creator (Dick Wolf) portrays in a very similar fashion of the real world situations.

I'm going to rate it 8 out of 10 because I like the acting styles for some of the characters, and the straight up 'tough guy' act that some of the characters put can relate to how some of the police in real life can act at times.
