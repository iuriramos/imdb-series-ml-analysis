Law and Order SVU continues to amaze. I was a fan of the earlier seasons but it wasn't until Stablers last 5 or so seasons when I became a massive fan. Then when the sad news came where Christopher Meloni decided he had enough I was honestly worried. HOWEVER the additions of Kelli Giddish and Danny Pino have been a great success and Im still enjoying every single minute of it. Every episode seems to be one where at some stage of it you are on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen and with some episodes having a slightly sudden endings you see yourself yelling at the screen for more. I cannot wait until season 16 comes on to the screen. 

Its one of those shows where even if you know whats going to happen because you've seen it before you still want to watch it again. I must get the box set when it finally comes to an end

SVU is by far the best our of all the Law and Orders,
