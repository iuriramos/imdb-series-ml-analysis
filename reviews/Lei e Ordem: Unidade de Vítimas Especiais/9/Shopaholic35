Detectives Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler are the perfect crime fighting team on television...well until Detective Stabler (Christopher Meloni) left the show. I was absolutely gutted that their dynamic was no longer present. Law & Order: SVU is by far the most successful and entertaining out of the Law & Order series but it seems to have lost it's edge. In my opinion the show went downhill from season 13 onwards.

In the first 12 seasons the cases always felt new and intriguing. While the newer seasons still keep you interested they feel somewhat darker and depressing. The cast also seem sad now and kind of damaged.

It is still a great show and completely worth watching but it has lost its shine that it once had.
