I agree with other reviewers that this is one of the best cop shows on television. What particularly makes it for me is that the makers are rarely satisfied with simple black and white. Rather, everything is painted in shades of grey.

With most cop shows, at the end, you know that the bad guys have been caught, the good guys have done their job, and all is right with the status quo. Here, characters question what they are doing, they argue, and in many episodes the questions are not comfortably resolved.

This is a show that is not afraid to deal with controversies: the ability of a person with a learning disability to give consent, abuse and discrimination against people with mental health problems, what the limits are to responsibility for ones actions. It raises the questions, and trusts its audience not to need a pat solution.

It is not surprising that this gets far fewer viewers than the CSI franchise. Depressing, but not surprising. It is, though, of far more value.
