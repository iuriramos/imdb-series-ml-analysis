for me,this is the best of the Law and Order Franchise.i really like the good mix of characters.they are well written and defined and the show goes in depth with them,both in their professional and personal lives.the show is also very edgy,and dark.it pushes the envelope.plus,there's more action than the original Law and Order,and Law and Order:Criminal Intent.i find the original Law and Order to be more of a procedural drama,so it's more about the drama.as for Law and Order:Criminal Intent,i find it lacks the edge of SVU.both of those other shows have their merits,but for me,Law and Order:Special Victims Unit is the best of the bunch.
