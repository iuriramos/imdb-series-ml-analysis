Yes I gave it a 10, but that was for season 1-12. Be honest now the show was what it was because of the relationship as partners Stabler and Benson had. Was Meloni really asking that much money for what he contributed to the show's ratings. I give it until the end of the season and that will be it for SVU. The limit of 10 lines is immensely annoying, I have nothing more to say, why is there a minimum of words for reviews? Mere nonsense if you ask me. You board members truly do need to amend your policies pertaining member television or movie reviews. Done, finished, all out of opinions on this television series. Am at a loss, and very upset with your unreasonable policies.
