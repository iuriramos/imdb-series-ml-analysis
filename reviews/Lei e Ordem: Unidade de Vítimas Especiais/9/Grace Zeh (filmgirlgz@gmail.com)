"LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT," in my opinion, is a pure definition of must-see TV! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which episode is my favorite. However, I get kind of squeamish whenever some accident victims are brought in. As a matter of fact, I think just about every single episode I've seen is touching. Everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can also be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.
