I absolutely love this TV show. It hasn't changed a lot over the years, which is hard to do when a show has been going for over seventeen years. I love everything about it. Some people say the cases are the same every week, which some are, but most of them have a twist, that make them completely different from everything else. My favorite seasons are probably Season 5 - 10, I don't know why. I liked it better when Stabler was still in it, but he's gone, and everyone else seems to be disappearing as well. But my favorite character is definitely Finn Tutuola, played by Ice T.

This show follows a group of detectives in New York City, who work for the Special Victims Unit. This means the crimes they work on are related to a special victim. Most of the cases are about rape, abuse, prostitutes, and pedophiles. Throughout the years, detectives have come, and gone, except for Olivia Benson, she's the only detective who has been there since the beginning.

Recommended for: People who like Law & Order, CSI, and even Boston Legal.

Overall, I give this TV show a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing.
