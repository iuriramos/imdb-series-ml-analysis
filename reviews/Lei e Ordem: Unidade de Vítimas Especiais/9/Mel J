A spin-off of the 'Law and Order' series, 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' has to be one of the best police shows on television in a long time. While I do enjoy the original 'Law and Order' series, it has to take a distant second place to SVU with it's gritty, involving scripts, well-depicted characters and excellent performances from all the cast. It is never afraid to portray the darker side of humanity and what depths people can go to in hurting another.

The characters give the audiences different means of venting their disgust and shock of the abuse cases the SVU team deal with. From Christopher Meloni's Elliot Stabler, who openly displays the utter hatred of paedophiles that we all identify with (and I hope there are many officers like Stabler in the police forces across the world), to Mariska Hargitay's Olivia Benson, who shows deep caring for the child and abuse victims she comes into contact with. The rest of the cast are also brilliant and give you a feel that these are characters who care for each other and the people they protect.

With the amount of rubbish that is aired on British television at the moment, SVU reminds me why I bother to keeping buying a TV license.
