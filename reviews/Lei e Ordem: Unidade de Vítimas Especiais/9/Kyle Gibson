It is rare that a spin-off of a show is better than the original. Law & Order: Special Victims Unit has managed to fit into that category. With its dark themes, great writing, gripping story lines, and fantastic characters, Law & Order: SVU surpassed the original Law & Order in my own opinion. This show is a must watch for TV fans everywhere. I do not believe this show has ever had a bad episode. Every episode hooked me enough that I didn't want to get up from my couch. Many episodes had me on the edge of my seat. It is rare for me to be genuinely excited for a seven-hour TV marathon, but this show makes me want to sit and watch it all day. I'd definitely recommend it to my friends.
