The one thing that continues to set Law and Order SVU from the rest of the pack is the compelling and emotional story lines, the actors and how each and every episode manages to keep you on the edge of your seat as these heart wrenching story's are told. I for one thought that the axing of Christopher Meloni (Elliot Stabler) would be detrimental to the show as the dynamic partnership between him and Mariska Hargitay (Olivia Benson) was one of the sole reasons the show was so successful over the past 12 years. However I was proved wrong and have to say I was extremely impressed with the performance by Danny Pino (Nick Amaro) who completely outshone his counterpart Kelli Giddish (Amanda Rollins) i'm afraid to say despite how much I tried to warm to her character. I also thoroughly enjoy watching the courtroom/prosecuting end of the show which always somehow manages to surprise me and enthrall me with twists and turns as cross examinations always seem to turn these seemingly slam dunk cases on their head All things considered this is an excellent programme which really has everything that a show needs to truly captivate an audience from start to finish. P.S The show also features Ice-T mean who doesn't love Ice-T
