I've seen every episode of the original Law & Order, Law & Order LA, a lot of Law & Order CI and every episode of Law & Order SVU up through the end of Season 15 and just a few episodes from Season 16, and really loved most of it.

During Season 15 it started to be a pain to watch. It seemed that even the actors knew that the show now stank and were there just cause it's a well paying job and they didn't have other prospects. They didn't even bother to try to act anymore and most of the time just phoned it in. The actors who had integrity left the show.

The more the writers started to center stories around the main characters' problems, and especially events surrounding Mariska Hargitay's character Olivia Benson the more unwatchable the series became. I was really hoping that when Olivia Benson was promoted to head of the squad, replacing Captain Donald Cragen, that she would fade out and only get the screen time that Captain Donald Cragen used to get, but sad to say, not so :( The producers seem to think that because Mariska Hargitay had won a few Emmys, that she was the way to go in order to save the show. Emmy's are won for the acting in a single episode and not the whole season.

It's really time to pull the plug on SVU; they should've canceled SVU instead of the original Law & Order. The original Law & Order still had life to it and wasn't the stale manure that SVU has devolved to.

Season 1 through 13 would get 7 stars, while the last few seasons barely deserve 3 stars.
