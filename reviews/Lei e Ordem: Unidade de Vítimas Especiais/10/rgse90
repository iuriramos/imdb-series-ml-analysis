This is one of the best TV shows of our time. Real life situations written by real life criminal justice personal. This series is so realistic that it even mirrors the real police procedures out of the NYC Patrol Guide. I applaud NBC for their commitment to keeping this series on the air and for producing one of the best series since Hill Street Blues was on the air. Except this series deals with real life cops personal issues and real life criminal issues and real life issues concerning bad cops. Great show. Thank you for producing the best show and giving us good TV. I hope that NBC commits to this show for more seasons because there is so much more to produce, even with recent events.
