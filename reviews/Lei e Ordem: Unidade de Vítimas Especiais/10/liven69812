Please include Tamara Tunie's character, Dr. Warren, in more episodes! Where is she? I miss her. At first, I did not think I would like watching Law and Order (SVU) because of the numerous casting changes that seemed to occur at the same time, but the show is still good. The show still has a nice ensemble-feel to it, unlike Law and Order (CI) that focused too much on the lead detective with the Psychology background. The entertainment business, occult, scientific-tinged, and the social-cause motivations for committing the crimes are the most interesting. NBC, do not move this show to another night -- I like Wednesdays!
