The best part about SVU is that each episode has it's own unique style and can range from political to religious, personal to international and by no means at all do you have to wait until the season finale for an amazing episode. Episodes range from their worst as good television to their best as absolutely phenomenal. The dramatic writing is great (the comedic usually consists of not-so-subtle puns and one-liners, but that's to be expected), and the acting is prime: Olivia and Elliot are a powerhouse duo and Hargitay and Meloni play them with passion and purpose. I'm surprised they haven't won more awards than they already have. Supporting characters and guest actors are consistently great too.

Even though its in its 11th season, the stories are still new and exciting and must be watched!
