I must say, I am a fan of Law and Order SVU. I find the story lines are great, very interesting, coupled with great acting and the script. The script is realistic, how real people would feel and express emotions. The main characters have weak moments, but in the police career this is normal and true. The lead characters are excellent actors, without them the script would not work.

The show a few episodes which touch at your heart strings and make you want to say "C'mon, don't let that criminal get away with it". I just saw Season 12, episode 3 which had Jennifer Love Hewett, again great actress choice and emotions were sincere and the cops couldn't initially imprison the bad guy so they stalked him as he did his victims, and then Benson says "You're my bitch now" and it was a gold moment. 

From all the crime shows, Law and Order SVU is by far the best.
