The focal point of the series has always been the detective team of Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson. They work in the special victims unit aka the sex crimes unit of the NYPD, also in the unit are John Munch(who alter on becomes a Sergeant), Odafin Tutuola and Captain Cragen. The show covers pretty every angle of sex crimes and child abuse, really bringing the stories home. IMO this is the best of all the L&O series, none of the rest of the L&O series really let you know the main characters as well as SVU does. In the main L&O show you don't really learn all that much out about the detectives outside of what they do for a living.
