In recent years there have been so many police dramas and most of them focus on homicide detectives, but SVU is somewhat rare in a sense that it focuses on sexual crimes, which are much tougher to watch. In addition it follows the case through court in most cases and shows the trial - a part which most crime dramas leave out.

The acting is amazing and true, for years Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler bring it to life. To say the chemistry between those two is perfect as well as the balance between them. Every other character around them brings something of their own to the mix making the show so good. They are all different and they do the job with different reasons. I'm certain that everybody can find someone to relate to. All of the characters are very well written and for some it takes seasons to figure out what are they fighting for and why. 

It's truly a show that puts solving the crime first and detective's personal life second or even third. True, there is some sexual tension, but it is always in the back. 

The story lines don't get old and they reflect our reality. It's only in recent years that feminism had rose again and sexual crimes against women are brought to greater light, but SVU tells the same stories from a decade ago. Still not all the victims are young females and the variety of the crimes, the reasons behind it and the results - in this show it's usual for the victim to be alive.

In conclusion I'd say that it's an amazing show, a must go for every crime show lover. It gives a reality check and a different perspective into the crime solving.

Plus Olivia Benson is truly well written character, who has become an inspiration to many. She is fictional, but I'd love to see a detective her passion in every police precinct.
