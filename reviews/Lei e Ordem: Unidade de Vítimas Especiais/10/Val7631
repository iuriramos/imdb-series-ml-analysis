I really love this show and I am totally addicted to it. I own seasons 1 & 2 on DVD and I know they have released season 5. But... Now don't interpret this the wrong way...I do love this series, but why would they release season 5 next but not seasons 3 & 4. This really makes no sense. I have been trying to re-watch the episodes on DVD but now I'm stuck at the end of the 2nd season. Why would I or anyone else of a sane nature want to watch a series out of order. I refuse to buy season 5 until 3 and 4 come out. I've been waiting for years for them to release 3 & 4 to fill the void between 2 and 5. Does anyone else feel my pain? Does anyone know where else I can write to plead for the releases of these missing seasons? Help...
