I look forward to seeing the new and the old shows of the Special Victims Unit. I truly enjoy them. I do not like Criminal Intent because the main detective seems to know everything and leaves nothing to the imagination. Special Victims Unit is good from beginning to end with everyone participating. There is no "Mr. Know-it-all" like there is in Criminal Intent. The cases in the Special Victims Unit seems so real and I love the fact that they officers are always searching and digging. They appear to be tough and sometimes intense, yet they show their human side. They care about the victims. I love all of the actors in Special Victims Unit. It's a great series and if I had the time, I would watch it all day long. I rarely miss and episode. I like the original Law and Order, but my favorite is The Special Victims Unit. I do not like Criminal Intent. There is no team work there and one man knows everything!
