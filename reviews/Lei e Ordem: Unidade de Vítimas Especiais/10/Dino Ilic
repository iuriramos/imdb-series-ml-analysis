Maybe it's due the fact that I love any TV Show that is oriented to crime or mystery, but this show as well as others from the series, show a great combination between Police and Prosecution. Perhaps that's the reason I like it. When I'm watching it, the stories seem so real, just like they've been taken out of ordinary life. Personally I love the grand jury especially because I don't have the same legal concept in my state so I'm always rooting for my favourite character. As I said, great characters, awesome stories, very good dramatic effects are all reasons I love this show. If you're a fan of the genre and you haven't watched Law & Order, definitely check this show out. It's really good and the stories will really make you think about it. What if I were the main character in this episode? What if I was prosecuted this way? Many question rise. One more reason to love this show!
