Ever since, my mom showed me this show, I fell in love with all the characters, especially with Olivia Benson, and Casey Novak. But all the other characters like Munich, Tutola, and Elliot, are all amazing! SVU, reveals not only the victim, and the criminals but also the problems, that the characters have to face, and consider. As well, the problems, with child molestation and Sexual abuse, is faced in this world today.

My favorite character Olivia Benson shows so much depth, about reaching out to the victims, and trying to find her owns reason, makes me feel like I want to be her. I also love it how she can touch the victims, with such caring words. If Mariska Haritigay were to leave, I won't watch SVU anymore, without her, it wouldn't be Law and Order: SVU. The same with Casey Novak, she will do anything to help the victims. But after she left...I was soooo upset that she left.
