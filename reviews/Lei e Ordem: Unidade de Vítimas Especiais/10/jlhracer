I am not usually into law all that much but this show is an exception. Each actor does an excellent job portraying their character and the show keeps me on the edge of my seat in every episode I watch.

Also, they do a excellent job at making the least suspected character that many don't think did the crime, the one who actually did do the crime.

They also do a good job at making the storyline for each episode. Instead of keeping the same old ones in every episode, they mix the story lines between rape, poison, kidnap, beating, child abuse etc. You just never know what the show is about until you watch it and that is what makes it so great. 

Overall, I give this excellent show a 10/10.
