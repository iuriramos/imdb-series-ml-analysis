The first time I decided to see it I was skeptic because I thought it was a TV series too positive, full of good-thinking and too centered on the honor to the law and the State etc. etc. but I had to change my opinion... Now, after watching many many many episodes ^_^, I think it's great! I appreciated it because it shows to the spectator shocking situations, that could be true, but also the profiles of characters, policemen/women and not. So it adds authenticity to the stories and it helps to understand and to know characters in a better way obviously with the help of actors' very good interpretations! In facts I think that all the cast is good (especially Mariska Hargytai and Christopher Meloni). There are some bloody particulars that are a little shocking, as I said, but it is a series that get the spectator to reflect about society and so you should watch it.
