Okay i started watching this show not when it premiered because that was 9 years ago and i was 10 back then, and not allowed to watch shows like that back then lol. But as soon as i started to watch this show i knew it was the show for me, this show honestly has EVERYTHING. acting top notch, directing, producing, story line, suspension, everyhting that a show should have :). In addition to all those factors this show is completely educating. I am a psychology major and half of the material we learn i learn watching this show. Every time i answer all questions in my class without reading the material. I think that children these days are much more mature than they used to be and if they watch this show starting at age 13-14 instead of watching other shows that they should not be, they would be much more educated in this world of ours. Aagin this show is an amazing show, these writers sure know what they are doing. Other shows should take a great big example from this show:) Thank you
