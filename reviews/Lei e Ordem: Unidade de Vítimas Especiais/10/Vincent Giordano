Words cannot describe the amazing Plot of the show! It is so addicting, you just can't stop watching it! I don't have a favorite character because the entire cast is amazing! I was heartbroken when Detective Stabler left, but it was going to happen anyway. The characters are so attached to each other, they all share an unbreakable bond. They care for each other so much, that it sometimes gets in the way of their work. That, unfortunately is the reason detective Stabler left. Both he and Olivia cared for each other so much that when the man held a gun to Stabler's head, Olivia didn't to risk killing Stabler. They have gotten to know each other for so long, that it is heartbreaking to see them leave. I hope B.D. Wong will be coming back. He was an amazingly skilled, and well played character. Law and Order: Special Victims Unit not only is they best Law and Order ever made, it is the best show ever made! I can't wait for season 15!
