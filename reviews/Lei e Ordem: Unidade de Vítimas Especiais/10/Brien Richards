I have been in and around law enforcement for over 30 years. Handled everything from barking dogs to homicides. Your folks are good at what they do. I love the character played by Mr. Ice T. I remember when he started his music about shooting cops and how crooked they were. I love the fact that he is now LIVING the job. He sees what we go through. He is a cop I would love to work with. He is honest, tough, tender with kids and victims, courageous and true to his word. That was my credo for 30 years. I didn't get rich like some cops. I just did my job. I did it honestly and from the heart. I coached a bunch of sports teams for kids and loved my wife and daughter. I find a great deal of solace in your episodes. The thought process is all the same, whether TV or for real. You have captured that quite well. Ice T, Munch, Elliot and that gorgeous lady, ( she is a stone fox, just like her mother Jane Mansfiled)he works with. You will have to forgive me, I have spent some big time in the hospital lately and my memory is lacking. Your cast is gold. They are great! Story lines are solid and based in fact not bullshit. Thank you. Thank you for a job well done. 

I remember this all started with Hill Street Blues, then Life on the Street, Then Law & Order. VERY GOOD SHOWS! But you guys have weathered the storms and triumph over all. Thank you for giving an old cop something worth watching. Oh yeah, I'll be glad to kick anybodies ass who dissagrees with me! I can do 24 in a lock up for simple assault! IT'll be fun to put some pansy ass in the hospital to prove my point. God Bless folks! May you live as long as you want and never want as long as you live! That's an old Irish blessing. 

Sincerely,
