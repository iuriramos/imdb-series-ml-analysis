I have been watching this show since their first season. I have always wanted to help victims come to justice and this show does just that. I am looking forward to my careers in sex crimes and putting those offenders. Law and Order: SVU doesn't compare to any other law and order TV show. I have always been touched by SVU. I hope other enjoy this show as much as me. I hope they will be around as long as the original law and order has been plus longer. I wish they would do more cases doing a one hour episode. I also think they should play new episodes more than once a week. I do understand it takes time to make the episodes. I believe they need more detectives on the SVU episodes. I Love this show and will also watch it everyday.
