This is my absolute favorite show ever! I own seasons 2 and 5 on DVD, and the episodes never get old. Mariska Hargitay does an excellent job as detective Olivia Benson, and she definitely deserves the Emmy she won this year! This show is most appropriate for older teens and adults, definitely not appropriate for little children. Contains some explicit details about rape, murder, etc, so children should not watch. If you like shows like CSI, 24, or any drama show, this show may be of interest to you! Detective Olivia Benson is currently on maternity leave and will be replaced by another detective. (Season 8). I hope this show continues to air for as long as possible! Most of the episodes are only one case per show, so even if you miss an episode or two you can still follow the show (unlike some other shows out there).
