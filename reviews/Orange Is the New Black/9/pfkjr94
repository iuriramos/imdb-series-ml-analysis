I really like this show because am a guy and I like to watch girls kiss. I mean who doesn't its just nature but anyway the way this show is built on is that you totally cant believe all of it. What I mean but that is the I believe that there is no prison in America that is that corrupt.

That being said I really do like this show and will continue watching it because it has a really good story to it and there are some good basic principal's to it that we all can relate to. Like for an example to always stick up for your friends because sometimes you don't know who your friends are till you need them.

Also I like how all the girls have a certain code that they follow that protect all of them because a lot of the time the guards mess around with them and they learn how to protect each other.
