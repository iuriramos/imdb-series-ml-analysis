After enjoying House of Cards, I figured I would give Netflix's next exclusive, Orange Is the New Black, a try and I was pleasantly surprised. I went in knowing next to nothing about the show itself or any of the cast or directors involved. From episode 1 I was hooked and the show just got better and better with each subsequent episode.

Through season 1, we get to follow Piper Chapman as she is set to spend time in jail. The show does an excellent job of being diverse with the casting. Don't expect your usual "supermodels" to be in the show. This helps add to the believability of the show as a whole. The cast is however full of talent. I can't think of one character that I really didn't like. And be prepared for Taryn Manning to steal the show as Pennsatucky, the religious Zealot.

With this being a Netflix series, the director was able to push the boundaries a little more than usual which I loved. Be forewarned this show can be a little dark at times and has plenty of profanity and nudity but it doesn't feel out of place.

Ultimately, the show is an excellent blend of comedy and drama that should please most. I would be prepared to lose a good chunk of your day when you sit down to watch an episode as it is difficult to stop at just one. It's content like this that more than pays for a Netflix subscription.
