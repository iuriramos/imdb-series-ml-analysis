Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling) is sent to prison after being caught with a suitcase of a drug dealer's money in this drama based on the memoir by Piper Kerman.

This is a show about what happened to real life Piper Kerman and she does consult on this show but it is ultimately about the relationships and past lives of all these fantastic characters that Piper Chapman meets in Prison. It is also filled with the entire range of human emotion and stories, all of which are brought vividly to life in a world where a slip of Lip-Stick could ignite either a love interest or a death threat. This prison is filled with the opposite of opposites. It is a war of races, sex and being sent to the hole of all holes. Piper's relationship with Fianc√©e, "American Pie" star Jason Biggs intensifies the overall piece - causing jealousy, anger, revenge, love and impending disappointment between these distant Lovers. It is delicate, dangerous, provocative and damn right hilarious. My favorite character "Crazy Eyes" is outstanding in her journey through Piper's eyes.
