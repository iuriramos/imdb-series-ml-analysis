This is the best Netflix original and that is saying a lot because House of Cards is fantastic too. It's nice seeing the online companies come out with their own originals. Give Comcast a run for its money. Comcast is too powerful for its own good sometimes. This is based on a book called Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison. The writer of this true story, Piper Chapman went to prison for a few months for transporting drugs. She's kind of educated and upper middle class, so she sticks out a little and has a hard time of, like anyone has a good time in prison. It's amazing how simple some of the plot devices are in this show, but it's written so well, a chicken becomes fascinating. It has a great cast that played their parts perfectly. It really gives you both sides of the story. The criminals aren't so bad and the guards and prison employees are so good. I think maybe, henceforth the title. It's funny and dramatic and gripping. If you have Netflix, at least put the first few eps of it in your queue at the top or stream it, if your have that option.
