I absolutely love Orange Is The New Black. It has everything; violence, drama, comedy and stereotypes all mixed in with a little bit of heart. There are so many truly shocking moments that keep you entertained week after week. While I'm not sure how completely realistic it is as I personally have never been or known anyone in jail but honestly who cares, it makes for really great TV.

It continues to surprise me how many of the prisoners had normal lives before they went to jail. All it takes is one bad mistake for them to screw up their entire lives. It's pretty sad how misguided some people are. You get to see their normal side as well as what happens when they get pushed to the edge.

Through all the craziness you begin to develop a certain appreciation for the characters. I can't wait to see how it all plays out and where else they can take the show.
