the first thing i gotta say:there will always be doubters don't listen to them,so the show is hilarious,heart touching,and brilliant in many ways one of these ways that the show quite succeeded in making the watchers love and have a deep sympathy with each and every one in this prison even if you know that they are criminals,that's not an easy thing to do and here comes the brilliance,u will be quite touched by their circumstances that led them to face this horrible fate,u will be kinda amazed about how they are trying their best to put themselves together and face each and every day with humor and loving each others,of course every TV series has it's ups and downs but if u got over some gross things that are happening in the show u will be in deep love with it that u're not gonna imagine ur day ends without at least watching an episode of it i have to admit one of the main reasons that i love this show that i adore the character of piper chapman even if she's not that perfect and she caused a lot of troubles to herself and to each and every one who around her but frankly that's what i love the most about her that she has their mistakes,it's not always about doing what's right,sometimes u gotta do whatever u wanna do whether if it was right or wrong don't fake it unless u feel it,one reason also that i love the most about oitnb the love relationship between piper and alex,and believe me it's not that cliché or the same traditional lesbian propaganda that's been showed in a cliché and unbelievable way,it's quite believable in fact and this relationship is gonna blow ur mind,anyways to cut it short i adore this show and i don't imagine the day where this show will end..
