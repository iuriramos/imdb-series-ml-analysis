I've seen two seasons so far from Netflix. I really loved it, especially the way it started with how prison is normally depicted to the public, then into how the inmates actually live in prison, and gradually into how the inmates actually are as persons - with a beautiful story telling of what their lives were before their convictions. The only thing that turns me off is Piper's and Alex's characters. They're probably the most inconsistent, and with the most superficial reasons for living. Society would do well if they're both kept in the 'Shu'. As for the rest of the characters, I find them so full of life. They easily represent a microcosm of the world, where everyone has his or her own history and struggles but has to learn to live with each other, embracing each other's full personality both good and bad, all for the hope of surviving each day until that near yet so out-of-reach freedom finally comes.
