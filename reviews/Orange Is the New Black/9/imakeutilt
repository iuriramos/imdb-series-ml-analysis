In my opinion this show is fun. Its made by the same chick as who did weeds. OK if your looking for a realistic show about prison life then watch msnbc lockdown. But if you want a fun little time waster with quirky interesting characters this is a good show. When not at work all I ever do is watch TV and movies so I see a lot of shows and movies and trust me this one isn't bad at all. It's about a white collar chick who gets sent to jail. And the characters she meets. They all get little flashbacks of background story so you get to know them and to get you a little insight on to why each one acts the way they are. Give it a shot. You may end up loving it.
