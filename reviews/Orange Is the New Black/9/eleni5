First I would like to congratulate and say thank you to the author, the director and anyone who has contributed to making this series. 

what i like about this movie is that it portrays the life of women in prison but it shows their lives before they became criminals. it shows how anyone with an ordinary life can get into trouble and end up in jail with all the consequences that derive from that. the movie is has a lot of sense of humor in it, i especially love all the black women actresses, they are hilarious, they are so damn good actresses! 

maybe the movie becomes very slow at times but it doesn't have to be all action all the time. 

This movie makes you want to go and play a part in it. but only in a movie, no one wants to experience real life in jail.
