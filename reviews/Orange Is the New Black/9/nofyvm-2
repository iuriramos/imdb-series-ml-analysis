I have only, and I do stress ONLY, given this series a 9 out of 10 because I have only seen the first three episodes of the first season. WOW!!! I am a huge fan of writing and directing that provide the characterization to be complex and consistently evolving. I am a huge fan of 'Series' television, but this show has taken it to another level. Jenji Kohan, excellent work! The way that the director lets you see each individual character, and then slowly divulges how their pasts have created their intersection in each other's lives, is superb. I can't wait to get to watch the rest of season 1. If you get the chance rent the first disc in season 1, and I promise that you will want to call in sick to work just to continue watching!
