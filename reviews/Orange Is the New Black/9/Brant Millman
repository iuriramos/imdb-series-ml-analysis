I am a bored 15 year old who needs something to do over the summer and I have been seeing commercials on TV about Orange is the New Black. It is by the same people who did Weeds and I liked weeds, so I checked it out. I really did not know what I was getting myself into. The show started off OK, but got better and more intense each episode. I watched the whole show in one day, on accident. I was just watching the show about to go to bed and one of the cliff hangers just made me not go to sleep. I stayed up all night finishing it. The show was great, fantastic actually. Netflix you've done it again. Also the season finale is a killer!
