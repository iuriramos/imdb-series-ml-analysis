I heard about this series via a TV interview on the Melissa Harris Parry Show yesterday (8/4/13) between MHP and a number of cast members from OITNB. The interview was intriguing enough that my wife and I decided to tune in via Netflix.

How was it? Well, it was engaging enough that I ended up watching all 13 episodes back-to- back, staying up until 3 in the morning. It's a great mix of drama and humor, even if there are any number of totally predictable moments to be had over the 13 episodes (the worst of these was the Xmas pageant, where we get to see the seemingly obligatory "other/talented" side of these women prisoners, complete with the out-of-nowhere, Susan Boyle-like singing of a character who is noted throughout the series for not talking, ever. Standard and clich√©, I'm afraid.)

But beyond those canned scenes, the rest of the series is entertaining and engaging. At least it isn't preachy and insulting to the intelligence.
