I started watching this show reluctantly, not being a Weeds fan, but I got sucked in so fast. Taylor Schilling just grabbed me, with her fantastic portrayal of the main character, she almost made me question my sexuality;-) 

The story telling is spot on, mixing up what's happening in current time in prison, with main character flashbacks, and supporting character's back stories. A very neat and clever flow.

This is Oz without constant shiving, but still edgy enough. And lesbian sex. And female camaraderie. And some hetero sex too.

Watch it - this is good TV!
