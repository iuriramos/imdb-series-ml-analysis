Okay, so I have had a lot of time to truly think about "Orange is the New Black" all in one from Season 1, Season 2, and Season 3; as I've saw them all many times. I had written about Orange is the New Black when it first come out, and of course I did so as each season released; yet I don't believe I truly put what I thought about the show in it.

Season 1 was a great introduction to the story of Piper and her journey within the show, this series started off well and of course slowed down a bit mid ways through and then picked up right as the series ended. The casting was good in every season released especially in season 3. I do believe that as they released season 2 that it didn't start out as well for a 2nd addition but it did start picking up as it started to reveal the route the show was going with the few additions and changes from season 1. Now season 3 of Orange is the New Black is one of my favorite seasons yet. The show casts seem to be more together, given the time together doing the show; it shows that they have grown into their characters a lot better. The new additions to the cast brought some new blood and more to the show, I believe it made the show a bit stronger now.

All and all Orange is the New Black is one of the best most recent TV -Series put out in American Media. Great job, I look forward to seeing season 4.
