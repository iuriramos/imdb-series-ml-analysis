"Orange is the new Black" is a series that seems to be a sort of toss-up between Weeds and Chicago. With the scene set, absolute perfection can describe the directing aspect in terms of translation onto film. The relationship between each character that our lead comes into contact develops a sense of genuine "niaveness" that is portrayed by Taylor Schilling as Piper Chapman. Schiling's does a terrific job at portraying the characters perspective of these horrific events that she had experienced, which to some may not have been too terribly frightening. This comedy drama caps the first episode with plenty "leg room" for each character to stretch and expand into. If you want to feel what it is like to be a normal white gal pushed into jail, I would highly recommend this series! Grab your popcorn and be ready to enter a new world with a unique take on prison. Enjoy!
