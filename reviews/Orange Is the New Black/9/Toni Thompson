This show was a pleasant surprise. Several of my friends recommended it, but it took me a while to get on board. I was assuming it would be another "Oz" like show and that I'd have nightmares for days about going to prison and a bunch of inmates helping me get friendly with a broom. However, that was not the case. As a black female, I am consciously aware of our prison system and how everyone can be categorized as "inmate" without a second thought to who the person actually is. This show highlighted that good people still exist and that we all make mistakes. The cast is so diverse and talented, and I found myself caring about the characters long after I watched episode 13. It is refreshing to see everyone's story on how they ended up in prison (via flashback) and how we can all be misunderstood at times. While watching the first season, I found myself laughing out loud, hoping, and crying right along with the characters. I highly recommend this show in hopes stereotypes will be erased and that we as women focus on a sense of community instead of living our lives through gossip and hatred. Can't wait for season 2!!!!
