I learned about this show from what was trending on Yahoo in the top ten. I heard never heard about it. So, I thought I would give it a whirl and see what was up with this series. HOOKED from the get-go. Watched the first three episodes back to back. Then finished the rest in the next few days. Could not stop thinking about what was going to develop next in the storyline. Some reviews about the show, say the characters aren't well developed. It appears a bit differently to me. The actors are top-notch in their craft, and they are able to do that with the excellent script given them to show that these women in prison are multi-dimensional. 

Granted it is a show that may not appeal to all audiences, it does deal with some very real issues that one would expect to have in a prison drama. But, if you are aware of this part of the story, you are in for a awesome viewing experience. Kudos to Netflix and Jenji Kohan for bringing us all incredible TV. The only thing is we have to wait till 2014 for Season 2, can't wait!!!
