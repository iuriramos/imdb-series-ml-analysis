This is a series which really will make you feel everything. It's deep, funny, sad, cool, crazy and everything in between. Not only are the characters on point, but the whole setting around them has a real ring of authenticity.

The main character Piper, has gone to prison for something she did when she was young, cute and coy she enters the prison with no clue of what is waiting inside. She quickly is thrown into "typical" prison-drama and it just spirals from there. 

I liked this series mainly because of the characters - you have the cook who runs everything, the crazy people who really makes your skin crawl, the asshole guard and the fat lesbian. The woman playing Piper is perfect in her role, and she really is the cherry on top. It is a real insight in human behavior and also the nature of women cramped together in one tight space. 

Thumbs up for Orange is the new black, don't hesitate to watch this series!
