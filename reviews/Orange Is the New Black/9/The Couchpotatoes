Now this is the kind of series I am waiting for with impatience every season. And as soon it comes out I watch the whole season at once. It has everything I'm looking for. Humor, excellent actors, a nice storyline, a little bit of sex and foul language. Even though it's in a prison you would think there are a lot of violence scenes but with this jail series there are almost none. And it doesn't need it, it's just fine like that. Every inmate has her own story and character and they are all a delight to watch. Just their routine lifestyle trying to make the best out of their sentence, and the sometimes genius conversations they have makes this show one of the best prison series there are.
