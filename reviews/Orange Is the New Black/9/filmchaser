Having watched 13 episodes of Season 1, I found this to be a wonderful story about one woman's experience serving a 15 month sentence in a minimum security women's prison. Based on the memoir of executive consultant, Piper Kerman, this is a story about Piper, a young woman raised in a white, upper middle class family, who completed her education at college, and while looking for a job as a waitress at a local bar, meets and begins a relationship with Alex, played by the statuesque and pretty Laura Prepon. The two young women live an adventurous and romantic life for several years globe trotting and drug trafficking for an international drug cartel until they eventually part ways. Then, after 10 years, Piper is arrested, tried, and found guilty of being an accomplice to drug trafficking and money laundering, right when she's settling down with her boyfriend, Larry, played by Jason Biggs. So, Larry drives his beloved Piper to prison where Piper surrenders herself to begin her 15 month sentence, with the intention of serving her time, and then marrying her fianc√©, Larry. But, Piper is a fish out of water in an environment that seeks to teach the hard lesson of conformity. The cast is amazing, and the storyline well written, with good character development through flashbacks. The guards and prison administration are portrayed as corrupt and exploitative in a believable way. The prisoners are multi-dimensional, at times sympathetic, with loyalties that change depending on what is at risk at that moment in time as tribal principles prevail. This story is about adaptation and survival as much as it is about finding love in all the wrong places. And this really happened to someone. I would highly recommend this enjoyable series, and look forward to Season 2.
