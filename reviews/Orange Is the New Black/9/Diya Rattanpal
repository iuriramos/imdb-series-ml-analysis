Having just literally binge watched all of season 3 in 13.5 hours with no breaks straight from the time of release i can honestly say this show is just as amazing as it was portrayed to be. This season detracted from the story of Piper and as a consequence, of Piper and Alex, but in its replacement the viewers were really able to get to know each character really thoroughly. The comedy and the drama again was of top notch quality... for the first 4 episodes at least. This contained the most 'Vauseman' and played real focus to Alex's return to Litchfield, which I thought was incredibly done. After that, whilst still such a good watch, it just wasn't the same with more of the other inmates being focused on and with the departure of Nicky, it just didn't have the same vibe. Norma's story was done excellently and so was Daya's, and it genuinely kept me interested. Very disappointed with the 'wishy washy' ending spanning over the last 2/3 episodes though, and it is bound to upset many other viewers who are big fans of the show since the beginning. Has a 9 purely due to the love of the first 2 seasons and the start of s3. Otherwise this season would be receiving a 7.
