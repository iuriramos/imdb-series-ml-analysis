I heard so many good things about Orange is the New Black and the plot made it seem like it would be interesting so i decided to give it a try....I can now say i have officially wasted hours of my life watching one of the most uneventful, overrated, unrealistic and just plain boring shows on television 

Orange is the New Black is a completely unrealistic portrayal of a woman's prison and the drama's that go on inside it. First of all, it paints prison like somewhat of a sorority, there are no gangs/factions, an extremely low level of illegal activity, very soft violence (if any) and all of the inmates seem to be each other's best friends. I also don't appreciate the fact that every inmate seems to be in prison for a reason that is not of her own wrongdoing, like ALL of them are victims of the justice system and have been hard-done by in their life.

I literally watched episode after episode where NOTHING happened, there is an episode at the beginning of the show, centered around the main character Paige, imagining she is seeing a chicken....i was honestly waiting for some kind of amazing cliffhanger or plot twist in this episode....but the entire episode was about a chicken 

I have never been a fan of long, overly drawn out weak character progressions, and that's exactly what tho show is. It has a bleak and unrealistic storyline, characters who are so predictable and incredibly dull that they are honestly hard to distinguish from each other, and absolutely NO significant plot twists, cliff-hangers or interesting story lines....

If you want to watch a boring, over-hyped, lesbian sorority then watch this show.....if you want something WAY better...then watch Orphan Black
