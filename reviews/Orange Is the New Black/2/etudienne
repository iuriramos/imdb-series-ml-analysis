An incoherent show. I gave it a try with 3 seasons on Netflix and this is it. It is jumping from this and that to that. Nothing is connected. The main character is really annoying and stops being the main character in season 2. Starting from season 2 there's a scattering of uninteresting stories. All of this could have been presented much better.

I, and my friends, sat through Weeds. Not gonna work the same way with this show. It is really not good and makes you think every second woman is a lesbian. I am not homophobic. But it is not one in two.

O
