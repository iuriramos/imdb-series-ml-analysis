So I get all comfortable and turn on this show. People refer to Lost a few times in describing the show. I loved Lost. Not one scene of nudity and yet it was nominated for multiple awards. The first, what 5-7 minutes all I see is boobs and lesbians, what is that all about? At that point, I still have no idea what the show is trying to be about. I guess lesbians and boob flashing. I turned it off. I thought that was a bad way to start a show that is suppose to be good. I am hitting no score, it won't let me so I hit a 1 for a score, it jumps me to a three, still won't let me submit ...

Try, try again.
