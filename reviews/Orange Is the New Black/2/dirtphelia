Season 3: like a bad soap opera that takes place in a mental institution/all-girls dorm that was created to satisfy a nerd's sexual fantasies. It's all over the place, trying to follow everyone's lives, past and present, without following anyone's life at all. It's like the show's gone ADD but with lots of half naked women and some girl on girl action.

After skipping most of Season 2, I watched it to see where (if) it all goes (somewhere) and as background noise, but it's garbage - the equivalent "junk fix" one gets when reading tabloids, I guess, but if you're expecting anything else forget about it out.

Season 1 was good but season 2 is so bad - SO BAD, it's like watching paint dry. It's utterly boring. This show is supposed to be about a WASP in prison but in season 2 you barely see her, in fact, she's not even in a least 1 episode.

From the looks of it the producers are trying to reach as broad an audience as possible by focusing on the Hispanic and African American groups in the show, also by introducing an Asian woman into the mix.

Barely anything happens. I'm skimming through episode 6 right now (I want to know what happens, if anything at all) and we still don't know what's happened to Alex Voss (or however her name's spelled).

It's like the writers of this show woke up 2 weeks before shooting and put some crap together. It's awful.
