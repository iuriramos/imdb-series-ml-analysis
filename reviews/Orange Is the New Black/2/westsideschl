1. I was anticipating some good acting but instead got a lot of shallow one liner clich√©s. I've seen better acting from actual inmates in prison documentaries. The writers went with the typical safe stew of - a few of these, a few of those (characterizations). Although, it seems that 99% of the institutional role models are portrayed as mostly self-serving baddies. 2. Who watches this series? Guys (and a few gals) who want to see full female nudity; overlapping with the same number who want to see medium porn. Finally, some want to bolster their sense of a meaningful life by seeing people having a miserable time either through bad choices, bad luck or socioeconomic position. 3. Plot? All predictable daytime soap fare of human tragedy (with a dash of hope).
