Don't get me wrong, some episodes have been OK and there's some exceptional acting in parts, but the writing on the whole is truly awful. Not a patch on Weeds IMHO. I made it through the first 3 seasons and am dismayed that there's another 4 to go.

SPOILERS: I don't think it helps how TERRIBLE the last episode of season 3 was. I mean really? Contractors came in and just removed a section of fence allowing all the inmates to go and frolic in a lake? WTF? Meanwhile key characters are left completely forgotten about. Not in a cliff-hanger kind of way - in a forgotten about kind of way. I suppose at this stage they didn't know they were getting a 4th season? Or at least that's how it feels... party in the lake folks 'cause this might be it! :-)

8.3??! Eight. Point. Three!! IMDb you should be ashamed of yourselves.
