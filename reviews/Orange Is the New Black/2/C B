If you're looking for a quality moment with your son, this isn't it.

After hearing part of an interesting segment on National Public Radio about OrgIsNBlack, I innocently thought since Netflix seems to put it on my screen every time I login, it must be good, and the reviews seemed positive.

Admittedly ignorant about TV show ratings (TV-MA?), I started into the first 2 minutes of the show before realizing that this is a smut burger designed as a garden burger and served right next to Hanna Montana on Netflix. 

As the Summary read, "Not a movie for The Family Man."
