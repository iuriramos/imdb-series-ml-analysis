This show is extremely boring and frustrates with its useless dialogs, over pushed events and its extreme lack of originality. Especially originality! I rarely get surprised by what is going to happen next. I will not get into the details because I will not stop, but who does not know what happens to the educated, "having-a-normal-life", charming, harmless cute person that -for some reason- goes to prison? Yes, you guessed it, this person will stood for itself, get out the darkness in its soul, become furious and cold-blooded. The main idea is old and unoriginal, let alone the sadistic/cruel officer, the corrupted administrator, drugs... blah blah blah.

I understand that the show is maybe more suited for girls, but the excessive nudity is absolutely unjustified for me. I am not against nudity, but only for the plot. Plus, nudity became old I think, we had enough in other shows.

For the lesbian thing, I started to hate lesbian after watching this show ( assuming of course the credibility of this show ). I was picturing lesbians as soft, cute, warm, kind... But what I saw is: stupid, lacking common sens, unreasonable and easy to manipulate.

To conclude, I thought this show will provide a different point of view for the life in prison, or life in general. However, I found a fully predictable show. The only thing I liked is the Bennet-Daya relationship, that one got me but other than that, I do not feel attached to any other character in the show.

PS: And OMG, I even heard people comparing this show to "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones" and "The Walking Dead". In the given order, this show is placed way behind these ones that the bare eye cannot see.
