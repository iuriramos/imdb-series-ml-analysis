I Love this show! It was actually recommended to me by my mom which I am very surprised that she recommended it, but I got really into it and Binged watched this show! There needs to be a season 3 and soon!!! Love everything about it and the end of season 2 was Awesome! This show had many twists and turns and surprises that you wouldn't necessarily expect in a prison type of show. A few of the characters change a lot, but so far all in good ways. Some at first make you get kind of angry, some make you understand, you find yourself hating some people and agreeing with revenge or wanting them gone just as the characters do. I find myself constantly siding with certain people and I have felt many emotions through the show; anxiousness, sadness, happy, laughter, angry and more, which is exactly what a great show will do to you. That is all I will say before I start giving spoilers!I definitely recommend this!
