After I watched the third episode I knew it to be true. Orange is the new black is the best Netflix original to be released so far. Not even. One of the best shows out in general.

The deadpan comedy really helps you enjoy every character. No one is 2-dimensional. Every character has a well thought out personality and story behind them and for once the main character of a series doesn't bored you to death.

Taylor Schilling was terrific and made sure her character was loved regardless of being this selfish and whiny person, but the truly impressive part about this series is the supporting roles around her.

Even the counselors and CO's were interesting though for the first season we aren't really told much about their backgrounds yet. Hoping to see more in the future and hoping the writers can keep up the good job.
