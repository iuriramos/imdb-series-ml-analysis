now i mean it when i say it that Orange is the new black is one of the best shows i have come across and believe me i watch a lot of shows, unlike most show this one has kept me coming back and waiting for season 3 is painful !! first of all the ENTIRE cast for this show is SPOT on ! and that is very rare these days with so many shows with bad actors but good story lines, the comedy is smart, fast and witty, i don't think there was one episode i didn't laugh out loud to! 

now all this said i watched the first 2 seasons within a week as i somehow didn't think this show could match up after being a loyal watcher or shows like "breaking bad" and "the walking dead" but boy was i wrong this show is truly well written and will have you hooked as it has left me !!
