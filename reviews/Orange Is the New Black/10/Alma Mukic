I love this show. Was bored one day and started watching this.. Watched season 1 in few days.. Great show, the cast is amazing! Finally an original concept that depicts women in a multifaceted way. Can't wait for the next season.. It totally sucks that you have to wait a whole year for the next season.. At least all the episodes of the season come out at once.. Amazing story line, in which the show can be very unpredictable.. You'd fall in love with each and everyone of the cast. And this show is just unpredictable! And you tend to like all of the inmates. But Hate the intro and song.

Thanks Netflix!
