I devour each episode the minute each season comes out. I binge watch and then re- watch right before a new season is released. It's addicting. The show is well written, has great characters, and has at least one character that everyone can relate to. Great show! The casting is suburb and the story lines keep my interests to the point of actually "caring" about these characters as if they were real people. As an actress and a writer myself, I appreciate both the depth of the plot as well as the challenges for the actresses. At first, I thought a complete series about inmates in a prison would be hard to keep me interested but I have been pleasantly surprised. Each season ends with a cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more. This show could not be any better.
