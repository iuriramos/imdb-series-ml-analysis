When I first heard about the show i thinking about a female "OZ" version or the British series"Bad girls". So glad it was not but a very funny and comedic approach to prison.coming on heels of another prison chick series "wentworth". its different especially with all the characters and from referring to race as tribes.the cast is great as no superstar name is associated but mostly upcoming actresses apart from 'RED' who I am familiar with her acting .the male characters don't just occupy space from porn-stash to counselors with his antics . I do hope the creative team can keep up the pace in season 2 unlike most currently running season.
