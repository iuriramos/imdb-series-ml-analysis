I just finished power streaming Orange is the New Black Seasons 1-3, and all I can say is I can't wait to see where season 4 goes. Piper looks like she is building herself up for a major fall, especially with her source of courage (apparently) blown away in the last episode of season 3. After setting up her new friend in retribution for shafting her out of her profits, her brother and his wife would have eventually messed that up. She just doesn't seem to get that she came up different than most of her peers. She isn't big enough to be bad ass like she wants to be, so with the overcrowding coming in season 4 with no experienced guards there is a great stage for it all really hitting the wall. Just when she should be sitting low, she is making a power play to try and set herself up for when she gets out. Girl has bad timing and even fewer clues. But like most of the Netflix productions, there is so much more reality to the show that I'm sure it will continue to go strong as she hasn't been the brightest bulb in the first 3 seasons (or the main character time wise), but she keeps growing colder. Never thought I would like it and I loved it!

Just finished Season 4 and they are doing good with keeping the shows quality high. Great cliff hanger to, having "Daya" ending up with the idiot guards gun being cheered on by inmates to shoot... very well a situation that could expose the abusive practices the private companies taking over the running of the prisons practice in cramming all the inmates in such small quarters and not spending the money as it should be to keep maintenance up and other corporate greed. Leaves the show positioned well for the coming season while Season 4 kept on rolling with same quality as prior seasons and hopefully the head guard with the power trip now gone given the how Season 4 ended. Left me hungry for Season 5 and beyond!!!
