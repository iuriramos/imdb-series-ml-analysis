This show has a great cast, amazing characters, and a pretty good story so far... I am only on episode 3 and already cried! Can't wait to watch the rest of the season! It is cool to watch Jason Biggs in this, he is very different from what I typically think of him as being. Kate Mulgrew is a nice addition, a kinda spicy polish lady. Natasha Lyonne is wonderful, I love her in everything! Laura Prepon is not that 70's girl anymore, she has become a delight to watch. Uzo Aduba has just the sweetest face, but watch out! Laverne Cox story is tearing me up, I can't wait to see if she upholds my current opinion of her character which is wonderful! Waiting with anticipation to see how Michelle Hurst's character develops. Dascha Polanco, that girl everyone loves, I am hoping her character gets more play. Michael Harney, he can't possibly be that sweet can he??? I can't go on! Only 3 episodes in and really enjoying this show! Taylor Schilling, not my cup of tea personally, but enjoyable to watch none the less.
