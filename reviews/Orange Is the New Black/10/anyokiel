I absolutely love this show! It is such a good storyline and shows just a normal suburban girl, Piper Chapman, can be changed in so many ways while in jail. The jail shown is minimum security so the girls aren't "locked up" and they have jobs and interact with each other every day. I love how they have flashbacks, it shows the character's past and might even reveal why they're in jail in the first place. One of the most intriguing things to me, is the relationship between John Bennett and Daya; one of the inmates. They end up falling in love with each other and John is a beautiful man, let me tell you. This is not very appropriate either. There is a lot of swearing, nudity,and sex. A majority of the sex is between two females and a couple of incidents between a male and female. I watch two episodes of this show every night.
