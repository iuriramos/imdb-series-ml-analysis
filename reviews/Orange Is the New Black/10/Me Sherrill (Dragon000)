After being addicted to "Weeds" and knowing my interest in prison inmates, I was fully expecting to love this show. But after obsessively watching the entire series three times, and finding myself on the message board forums posting like mad, I realize addiction does not even cover it! 

The story of Piper, who has to turn herself in to serve prison time after having found a "normal" life, is one that many of us can relate to on one level or another. How many people out there committed crimes "back in the day" and got away with them? Have you ever feared that these would at some point come back to haunt you? Some people even have this actually come true. Most just fear it, for the rest of their lives.

One thing I like about Piper is that she was bisexual all along. She did not fear, like some do when entering prison, that a woman would try to "hit" on her. She was okay with that, presumably; although when the wrong one, in whom she has no interest, does "hit" on her, she does have a predicament to deal with.

More interesting than the story of Piper, are her fellow inmates and the corrections staff. I fell in love with many of the inmates, as I learned of their stories and witnessed their ongoing life situations. I felt distaste for the prison staff, from the bureaucratic pencil-pushing assistant to the warden to the immoral guards and all of their flaws.

The choice of Jason Biggs as Larry, the hapless fianc√©' of Piper, was not one I agreed with, and I found the scenes with him to be annoying and less interesting than the rest of the series. Fortunately, he is not focused on nearly as much as the life in the big house!
