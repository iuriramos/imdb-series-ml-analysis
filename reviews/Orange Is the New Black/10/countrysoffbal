It's got a great cast, it's equally funny, dramatic, cute, and serious. it's got a list of different people besides the main characters whose story you can follow as well, it's got a good story line, a good mix of characters, it's got heart and it hits nerves. It's well written, well captured and well portrayed and I'm glad i got to watch it. i watched the whole season in like four days and if i'd had more time, it would have been less lol i didn't want to stop watching it. My sister recommended it to me and i am glad she did, i recommend it to everyone else. Lol and i can't wait for season 2. (and it needs to hurry up and come out with season 2 because now i am addicted to this show.... lol so hurry up!)
