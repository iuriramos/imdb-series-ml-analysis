Not since Breaking Bad have I been glued to my TV for so many episodes of a series. In fact, even though Breaking Bad is my favourite TV show ever (can't wait for those last 8 episodes) I would have to say that in terms of character development, Orange Is The New Black wins hands down. I have never been so wrapped up in so many characters in a show, or ever cared so much, for so many. 

There have been many, many, prison dramas before and most cover the foul side of things as the main trait of prison life. But OITNB takes you on a roller-coaster of emotions from being happy, sad, thrilled, and stunned at twists you never saw coming (that part compares well to Breaking Bad). It's so complete and so immersing that you just don't want to let go. 

Netflix have pulled a very smart move issuing all the episodes at once, initially I thought this was a bit strange to do this as it might have ruined that "cliffhanger" aspect for the next show in the run, but no, instead what happens is, you're not allowed to forget it, each episode is loaded there in the chamber, ready to fire. Totally inspired for a show as good as this.

I won't go into the plot(s) of OITNB. But it's brilliant how every character gets their screen time, and every character gets to tell their tale. It's not just the leading female who runs the show, although it's always interesting when she's on screen, but everyone else plays their part too. The most uninteresting characters are probably those outside the prison, but they're still required for contrast and interaction.

If you haven't seen this series you really must. It's probably going to fly under the radar a little more here in the UK as Netflix doesn't have the same audience (yet) as it has in the USA, and certainly concerning this show that's a shame. It goes without saying now, none of us can wait for series two.
