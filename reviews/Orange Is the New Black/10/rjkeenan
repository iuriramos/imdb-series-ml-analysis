Outside of "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones", and "Walking Dead", this is the best show right now. What great character development. Jenji Kohan got it right this time. Kohan's other project, "Weeds", started out a really good show for the first two seasons, then just started to feel forced and ridiculous- you also kept losing empathy for the protagonist. The protagonist on this show has much more promise, and all of the characters are mysterious but round in their development. The flashbacks provide a much broader understanding of their history and what drives them, similar to "Lost", which mostly proved effective. 

There is a lot of humor provided in Kohan's new series, but the humor is more based in reality, as opposed to the unbelievable goofiness that eventually ensued on "Weeds". I applaud Schilling and Mulgrew for their amazing work on this show, and Jason Biggs provides the adequate amount of comic relief just when it's needed most. The only criticism of the show would be Laura Prepon. Like in everything she does, she falls completely flat and doesn't add any real tension to the show, which is the only point of her character- that was a complete miscast. Aside from that, this is a close to perfect dramedy.

Netflix is really starting to step it up and give the big paid cable networks a run for the their money. Good- HBO and Showtime need to get with the times and create stand-alone programming outside of cable providers- they deserve to lose customers for that and Netflix is starting to pave the way with shows like "Orange is the New Black" and "House of Cards".
