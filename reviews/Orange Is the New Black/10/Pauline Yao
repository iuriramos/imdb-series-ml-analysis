It blows my mind how a TV show possesses the ability to make me so happy. I'm 29 years old, my all-time favorite show is Grey's Anatomy, and I'm not certain any show could change that but "Orange..." sure gives it a run for its money.

I finished season 3 within weeks of it coming out and at the moment, I'm in the middle of re-watching the second season, just as I did the first.

This is the first time I've written a review about a TV show but I feel obligated to because it's brought so much joy into my life. I love the levity in it, I love the authenticity, I love the dynamics of friendship... and every other nuance in between. It just feels real. I'm having a pretty sucky day, and because my wallet doesn't feel like splurging on a foot massage, I find myself seeking therapy in the next best thing... no less than a trusty episode of OITNB.

Despite the fact that I find the sex scenes too graphic (its only flaw in my opinion) for my taste, I still rate this 10/10 simply because it merits it. A thousand times over.

To the writers and the cast and the crew, know that there's somebody out there in the world (Manila, Philippines, to be precise) whose day you've made (many a time) because of your work and dedication. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

To the fellow fans out there, please feel free to email me at paeyao@gmail.com if you wish to discuss the show! I would be so happy to. Love.
