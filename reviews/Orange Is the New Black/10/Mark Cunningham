I was recommended Orange is the New Black by a friend, and even after only watching the pilot episode I was immediately intrigued by this wonderful series and I could tell it was going to be a new favourite.

First off, the dynamic of the series is very original. OITNB manages to achieve the perfect balance of humour and drama that is often lost in many modern comedy/dramas. Although the plot is based on a women having to spend 15 months in prison, it actually takes a very comical approach to this. The show is filled with crazy and wacky characters, from inmates to prison staff, and when Piper Chapman, the shows heroine, is placed in with these characters that seem so different to her own, it faces her with a challenge to stay sane. 

The acting is flawless and makes the show seem very believable. The plot is totally unpredictable and constantly throwing itself at Chapman to give her a few life lessons. 

The only way this show could possibly be better would be if there were more episodes! Overall, if you're looking for a show that has comedy, sass, and some family drama on the side, then you will LOVE Orange is the New Black.
