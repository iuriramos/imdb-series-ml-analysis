I liked everything in this show. The cast is so diverse and talented, it's the best cast ever and the script's amazing. Every character could have its own show. The Acting was perfect. It has a lot of moments where you can't take your eyes off the screen. Yael Stone acting was the best one in my opinion. Once you watch the first episode, you're gonna want to watch the next one, and the one after that, and so on.The show delivers a perfect balance between comedy and drama. What I love most about this show is the characters and the character development. With every episode I feel very connected with each and every one. Every one has a very individual and unique personality. This show is entertaining on every level.
