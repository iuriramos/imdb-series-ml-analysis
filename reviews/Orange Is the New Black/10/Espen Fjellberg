Netflix keeps it coming. I saw "House of Cards", and i have to admit i liked it. But this? This is something else. I have watched a lot of movies and television shows in my life and i spend a lot of time reading reviews on IMDb before even considering to watch a movie or a new television show. I've never felt compelled to write a review before until now.

"Orange is the new black" got me hooked from the start. We follow Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), whose life has taken a turn for the worse. She is heading to prison.

Hats off to the cast. I have never in my life seen a show with such a colorful and joyful cast to watch. They are all interesting to watch. Some of them really cracks you up too. At first they're all scary, but as their stories unveil along the way you realize they are all not that bad. I didn't like the lead at first (Taylor Schilling). I felt that she didn't quite understand her role, but after a while as i saw her character develop i realized, she was perfect.

In my opinion, this is the perfect mix between drama and comedy. Kudos to everyone who works on this show for having the guts to make something "outside the box".
