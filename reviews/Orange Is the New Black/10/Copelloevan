This show captivates the similar character as Weeds. The main character, much like Nancy from Weeds, is full of inner turmoil and is constantly getting herself into heart stopping binds! They go into excellent character biographies, and soon you either fall in love or hate certain characters. It is full of nudity but it is reality, nothing held back. If you are looking for a good non-realistic story lien similar to Weeds than look no further. Piper Chapman will have you guessing all the way! Definitely a show worth watching! Just talked to Netflix today and it seems like they are expecting a new season early next year! I am in love with this show and the character development and cannot wait until next season comes out!
