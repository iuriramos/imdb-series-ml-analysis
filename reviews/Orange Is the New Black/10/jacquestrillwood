Let me explain something, okay? This is not your typical Hollywood television show. This is Orange Is the New Black. Yes, there is sex and lesbian content. No, I don't care. I hear how people keep saying this show is "inappropriate" or "racist towards black women." STOP. All of this is not true. The storyline for this show is phenomenal and has great actors. Once you watch the first episode, you're gonna want to watch the next one, and the one after that, and so on. It's just so good I can't even explain.... Look, if you read this review and you're not sure if you want to watch the show, I say go for it. Simply amazing. But if you have those over protective parents that hate sexual content, I'd watch it on my own time.
