I watched the full first season in 2 nights. The cast is amazing all around but I had my two favorites early on! Poussay (sp?)and Taystee. These two girls are unbelievable and the last episode just confirmed why I enjoy them so much. Multi-talented! . It will make you laugh and cry. Probably appeals to women a bit more than men but the characters are so strong that you get very caught up. I'm trying to get my daughter (huge WEEDS fan) to watch and anyone else who will listen. Lots of stereotyping going on but it's necessary for the storyline. And I love seeing "Donna" from That 70s Show in a much different role. Can't wait for SEASON 2.
