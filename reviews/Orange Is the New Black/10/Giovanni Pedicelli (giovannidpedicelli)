I started watching OITNB and I was hooked. The characters were so amusing to watch and the actors are so into making this show the best show of the century. Every season was better than the previous one. I am so excited for the next season! They keep introducing new characters that are amazing. It makes me want to be in that prison. There are many rivalries that I would love to watch them fight in real life. Obviously, it is very unrealistic as real life prison is not that "fun". I recommend that if you are an adult and you have a child under 10 years old, I would go watch it in another room because there are some sex scenes and also some curse words. Other than that it is an amazing show!
