My second review is for the new TV show "Orange is the new back". It is a TV series about a girl named Piper Chapman who goes to prison after getting caught up in a drug smuggling ring with her now ex lesbian lover. This series was created by Jennie Kohan, the creator of "Weeds". This show is quite interesting. It has all of the elements of a comedy drama series. It is provocative and addicting. It gives the audience a glimpse of what it could be like for women in prison. There is a wide variety of characters from many different cultural backgrounds. There is also a wide variety of staff members. This show has everything people look for, serious moments thrown together with some serious comedy. I think one of the best elements of this show is that they are slowly developing the characters and the reason why they ended up in prison. Each new episode introduces someone's story. You start to feel sympathy for everyone and their differences. You start to relate to their stories.
