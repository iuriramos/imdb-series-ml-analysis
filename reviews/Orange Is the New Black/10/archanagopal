I just finished watching about 10 episodes of it and I am half way through the second season and I am simply not able to stop myself from watching more, a part of me wants me to slow down just in case I watch it all, what would I do next. If this gets over I would not know what happens to them. So this happened to me after watching the first ten episodes. I found myself completing the dialogue, and I felt as though the story moves just the way it is supposed to, it doesn't assume what the viewer is likely to feel. It feels real. Orange is the new black has made me a researcher, I want to know more about the author, how much of the series is based on her story and what happened to her and I have never felt that way about any t.v. series before. I laughed, I cried and I cringed at some of the parts. There is horror here, oh yes! After watching the wheelchair scene I do find myself asking this question - Amidst sorrow, pain, betrayal, karma and most of all you, can you succeed in creating something? You will have greater respect for life after watching this or find the courage to do something new with it, I do assure you that. I am now going to research if there is any orange is new black anonymous group that I can be a member of.
