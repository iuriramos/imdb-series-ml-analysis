I signed up on IMDb just to rate this show, because it's one of the best shows I have ever seen! I watched the first season in 24 hours and second season also in very short time. I disagree with some of the viewers, I also enjoyed the second season. It was more serious than the first one, but never boring. Only the Christmas scene in the end of the first season was a tad annoying - oh those holidays...but it was just a small flaw.

There isn't a much new to say about the show that other viewers wouldn't pointed out about OITNB already, but I especially enjoyed the FIERCE women, their complexity, persons, strength and weaknesses. Fresh breeze of feminism, realism and honesty, life and people are same time ugly and beautiful.
