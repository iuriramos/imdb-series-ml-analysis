I got the free trial of Netflix last night, and in just a day I've watched the entire first series of OITNW. It's an amazing TV show - I've never watched anything like it! It has a lot of moments in it where you just can't stop laughing, and a lot of moments where you can't take your eyes off the screen. Taylor Schilling is an excellent role for the main person, and the other main characters such as Jason Biggs and Natasha Lyonne (American Pie) make this show fantastic.

It's certainly not one to miss. Either get the free month trial from Netflix or buy it every month, and watch this show. You will be impressed.
