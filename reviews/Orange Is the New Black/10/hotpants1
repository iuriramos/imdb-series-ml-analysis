My friend had suggested I check this show out. Great series! Love all the dynamics in the show. All the individual stories on how each woman got to where they are... loved it. The twisted love stories that start the show and develop are so entertaining. Mendez is such a jerk! And this Healy guy... wooh! 

Had to keep watching it till I finished the whole season. It's like a beautiful summer day and I'm spellbound by this show and in the house because I was hooked. You will not be disappointed if you watch this. I cannot wait for the next season to come out!! Please don't take forever to do another one.
