To be honest, I wasn't going to watch the series because it didn't look or sound very interesting to me when people were talking about it. Then my friend invited me over and insisted that I watch it so I watched the first episode with her and was hooked. I LOVE the characters. I feel like I could know them in person and really love them all like they are a part of my family. I truly can't get enough! I love how the characters have flashbacks of their pasts as well. It gives us that inside look of what really went on in their previous lives which is really interesting. Your emotions really get played with regarding whether you like a certain character or not as well. Sometimes you love them, sometimes you hate them. There has been so much drama that half the time I won't even get up to use the bathroom because it's so intense and I don't want to pause it! I watched both seasons within 2 weeks time and I cannot wait for the 3rd! It's crazy, funny, sad, complicated, and sexy all rolled into one! I would recommend it to everyone I know!
