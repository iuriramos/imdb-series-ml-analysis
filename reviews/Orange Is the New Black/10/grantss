(Updated after Season 4)

Brilliant series.

The story of your average early-30s female yuppie who gets sent to prison for 15 months for a crime she committed 10 years earlier. Series Episode 1 shows her checking into the prison, and the rest is what goes on inside, plus the effects of her incarceration on her friends and family.

Initially I thought it was going to a female version of Oz, but it is far better than that. Multi-dimensional: funny, sensitive and sometimes dark. There is heaps of depth to the characters. Clever use of pre-prison flashbacks to show what motivates characters in certain situations, and how they got to be in jail. Very sensitively done, it often shows how their personalities were shaped.

This also serves to show that you can't simply judge people by their current actions - everyone has heaps of baggage. 

Superb performances from a spot-on cast.

So different to what I expected, and very pleasantly so.

Season 4 continues the good work and is the usual mix of powerful drama and biting comedy. Maybe a bit darker and deeper than previous seasons due to covering issues of insanity, depression, guard brutality and prisoners' lives once they get out of prison. . Some characters who didn't get much focus in previous seasons get more of the limelight, while others get less. One of the casualties is Pennsatucky / Doggett (Taryn Manning), which is a shame as she is one of my favourites - multi-layered and funny. On the plus side, Lolly (Lori Petty) gets much more screen time and she is great: funny and sad, all at the same time. 

The last two episodes of Season 4 are incredibly powerful and moving.
