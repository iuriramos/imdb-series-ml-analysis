Laura Prepon is Alex Vause on this TV show and she do it so well, how can I be a straight girl when exists Laura Prepon/Alex Vause??? The OITNB cast is amazing, they're all so good actors and actresses! You can hate a character and love he/she in the next second because they're so imperfect as all the humans. You can feel connected to a character on OITB because they're not perfect people, they've committed crimes and that's what makes the TV show alive! I recommend this TV show to all the humans being. 4 season will be on the air in 2016 on Netflix. I know, I know, you've to wait like 1 year, but you can re-watch the show all the times you want! Go to the couch, watch OITNB and enjoy as much as you can! Oh, right... There's one more thing I need to tell you... This show will puts your sexual orientation in question!
