At first I had reservations about watching a show about women in prison. Sounded boring. I was picturing "Sex in the City" but in a prison. I could not have been more wrong. This show is entertaining on every level. Great script, great acting and surprises around every turn. It has it all...humor, violence, sex, witty dialogue and many emotional ups and downs. If you are thinking about watching anything right now do yourself a favor and watch every episode of this show today! There are scenes that will shock you beyond belief. Oh and some pretty cool music as well. I enjoy the different songs at the end of each episode.
