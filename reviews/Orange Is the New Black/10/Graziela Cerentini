Finally a show that holds the viewer's attention! Each story of the characters is addictive and leaves the viewer anxious to know each one. It had been years I didn't watch every episode of a series several times. The chemistry between Taylor and Laura is incredibly catchy. The balance between drama and comedy is perfect. Piper is just an excuse to tell the story of the other prisoners. Somehow, over the episodes, you end up seeing every woman as a person who made a wrong choice in life and not just as criminals. You want to have a best friend like Poussey or Tayste. Met someone crazy like Crazy Eyes. Having someone who loves you intensely like Alex. In the end, you want all the characters for you.
