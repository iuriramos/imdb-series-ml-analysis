I stumbled upon this gem recently and I stayed up till 5 and 6 in the morning for the last 2 nights. Its a wonderful new TV series and its in- depth view of each character is wonderful. It makes you feel like you're really connected to it. I was really surprised at how unpredictable the script was and i loved it. I was impressed by Taylor schilling's performance as she went from extreme ends of the emotional spectrum within seconds. I especially love the content and how it portrays an insight to the world of female prison. The interactions between the sketchy law enforcers aka prison guards and the inmates. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. It's the much less explicit version of the L word.
