This just has to be one of the greatest shows ever made. Everything about it is perfection, from the writing to the acting to the casting, everything is perfect. The show delivers a perfect balance between comedy and drama, with the first season being more focused on comedy and the second season being more focused on drama. The acting is probably the best acting of any TV show I've ever seen, dare I say, even better than that of Breaking Bad! In fact, this and Breaking Bad are probably the only two shows where I would consider every episode to be great. The Season 2 finale, "We Have Manners. We're Polite", has to be the best episode of any TV show in my honest opinion. This show has been excellent so far, and I can't wait for season 3!
