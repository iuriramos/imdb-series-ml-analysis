I was a bit skeptical at the beginning, but I decided to give this show a real chance after being pleased with other Netflix series. It didn't disappoint. 

While the story revolves around Piper Chapman, the show thoroughly takes you into the lives of the other inmates and how everything and everyone ties together. This show goes into a rare amount of detail that I can't remember many shows ever doing. While it's all not happy and joyful, the show takes something that seems quite depressing (prison) and brings out some of the brighter side of a bad situation, focusing on the relationships and details of these women's (and men's) lives. The show brings humor into a dark world but doesn't "soften" the situation, still showcasing the worst things we've all heard about prisons. 

At no point in the show did I feel like it was becoming predictable, and every twist/turn was legitimate. Unlike other dramas, every small thing that happens has significant meaning. The relationships are unpredictable, which just draws more interest in the long-run. 

At several points in the show, my mind was blown. There are just so many things that happen that nobody could ever predict. The show astonished me on so many different levels. Every episode had me dying to find out what was going to happen next, and now I can't wait until the next season starts.
