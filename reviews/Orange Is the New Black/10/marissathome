This show is absolutely fantastic. My husband and I were big fans of Weeds as well and this show makes me laugh, it makes me cry, it makes me angry. I am in love with every character on the show. I have no idea what prison life is like but this show seems to be more of an emotional capture to each individual audience it collects. Hands down to the writers of this show as well as the amazing creator. I truly find myself rooting on certain characters, and wishing some get what they seem to deserve. I can't wait for the second season... I have all the confidence that it will be just as excellent if not progressively achieving more and keeping me on the edge of my seat...Excellent excellent excellent...
