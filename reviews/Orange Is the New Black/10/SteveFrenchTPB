I watched all 13 episodes already...and the show launched less than 2 days ago. Yes it's THAT good! I was already interested in "Orange", as I assume most of you were, because of the magic Jenji Kohan has given us before...but this gem blew my expectations away! The way he lets the characters develop without feeling forced will make you care about these inmates and C.O.'s, and you won't even realize it until you try to take a break from watching. Fans of his work in "Weeds" will instantly feel at home with his direction style and camera work. The humor he writes into this series will bring back fond memories of The Botwins without feeling stale in the slightest. Much like the classic prison drama "OZ", this incredible cast holds it down in a small prison setting with ease. You will see names you know, but the ones you don't will steal the scene. The way Kohan weaves in flashbacks of how the inmates got there flow seamlessly in with the prison scenes. I was glued to the screen through all 13 episodes and already I'm excited for season 2.

This is an instant hit, don't pass it up!
