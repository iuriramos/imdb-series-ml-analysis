this show stereotypes lesbians, gays, and other races in the worst and most terrible ways. just because she is a lesbian doesn't mean she has to look like a "dike". they want you to be OK with prison and all the things that happen there because the united states, has the most prisons in the world. this is in fact the worst most awful show in the history of television and should be gone forever. the writers, producers and directors should be ashamed of themselves. this is a disgrace to the prison community. the creators have no right to make up what happens in prison. it is very sad to watch racism, discrimination and sexual harassment in this show. orange is the new black should be banned from TV.
