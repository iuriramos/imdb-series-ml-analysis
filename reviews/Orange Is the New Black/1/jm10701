I can think of two reasons to watch a TV series: I enjoy the characters (either like or dislike them, or both) and become interested in what happens to them (The Simpsons comes to mind); or something about the series arouses a more or less sexual response in me. Sports bore me to death, but I loved Friday Night Lights because so many of the guys were gorgeous. This series neither entertains me nor turns me on.

I'm a gay male, and nothing about the female body or female sexuality excites me; in fact, it turns me off. So just the idea of a women's prison doesn't automatically get my juices flowing, and the abundant nudity and sex in this series leaves me cold and irritated. On top of that, every single character in this series is annoying, from the leads to the very least of the supporting roles.

Piper Chapman is so obnoxious that she deserves far worse than what she gets here; I'd keep watching if I thought she'd eventually (hoping for sooner rather than later) get bumped off, but I know she won't. Her loser boyfriend isn't even sexy, which would be my only hope in a scenario like this.

A Jewish nerd is pretty much my ideal man, but there's something very creepy about Jason Biggs (he isn't Jewish, for one thing) that negates any appeal the character might have. There aren't even any real villains I can hate, just dozens of petty, stupid, ugly, obnoxious jerks, who spend all their time posing and snarling.

By the time I had struggled through the first two episodes, the "So what?" factor was so overwhelming that I gave up. If it gets better later, I won't know or care.
