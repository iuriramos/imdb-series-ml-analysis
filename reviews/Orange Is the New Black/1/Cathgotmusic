There's fun drama, there's intrigue drama, heartrending drama, and then there's just: "Nuh UH! I know y'all didn't eat my cream puff, ****! I will CUT you!"

Orange is the New Black is basically the worst kind of nasty, shallow, anti-intellectual trash bags getting together, and being even greater trash than the sum of their parts! Hooray? 

There's a complete overload of self-hating, poorly conceived characters constantly calling each other all manner of female targeted gender slurs. The butch overweight lesbian talks about wanting to put 'her penis' in someones mouth. Yep, this is a bunch of women trying too hard to emulate what they think are tough ghetto men. 

Most of the show is actually spent sitting around tables clucking and cooing derogatory nonsense at each other, and then laughing too hard about it. 

Also, why are a quarter of the women turning out to be lesbians in this? I've seen enough boobs, please. I didn't enjoy the opening lesbian stuff, but watched it because I thought it would be intriguing having that element on the show. The writers did nothing interesting with the lesbian angle however, and instead expanded it as blatant titillation throughout the rest of the series. They did manage to portray lesbians as uncontrollably horny, rude, aggressive, and crazy in the process though. Pretty insulting.

Once in a while they actually do some sort of character development in the form of flashbacks for each character. Don't get your hopes up, it only seems more interesting in contrast to 20 minutes of of aggressive idiots hooting and cussing each other out.

If you want a show that treats its viewers like they are bottom feeders that thrive on endless episodes of 'Jerry Springer - Women's Jail Edition', this is what you've been waiting for!

Otherwise, stay clear.
