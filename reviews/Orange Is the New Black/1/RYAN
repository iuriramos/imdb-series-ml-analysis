I was a fan of this show when it started and into the second season. I just finished the third season and I can not believe it is getting such high reviews. I am not sure what happened in this season. I feel like the writers phoned this in. There was no story, just focus on each prisoner's little stories that made a huge effort for watchers to believe that the system is the real criminal and that the prisoners are all just victims. The show isn't even about Piper anymore, her storyline was so weak and boring. The relationship with her and Alex was dull. I couldn't wait for their scenes to end. The only potential storyline was what was going to happen to Alex and they just squeezed in a stupid ending that I guess was supposed to be a cliffhanger.

I am not real sure what this show is about anymore. At the end of episodes in the first two seasons you wanted to watch the next one to see what was going to happen next but not this time. NOTHING HAPPENED! There is no main character, I could really just care less about anything going on. It was painful to watch every episode. The only thing that kept me going was the possibility that the new girl Piper is working with was going to kill Alex. Sounds morbid I know but it would have at least been an interesting twist. Instead we got a super random and weird wedding, and hard to watch prisoner inmate relationships.
