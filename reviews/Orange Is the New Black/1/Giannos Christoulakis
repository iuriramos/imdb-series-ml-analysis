I seriously have no idea how this got 8.3 i couldn't see more than 5 episodes (and believe me i tried). I think this series is just a "girly" version of a prison. I mean the worst thing that happened to the protagonist was to not eat for a day or two , watch some lesbian (witch she liked), get commented for her boobs (which again she liked) and cut some of her hair for another prisoner's hair.. WOW SO HARDCORE.In prison break you will see exactly what you want to see. You will be on edge every few minutes and the plot twists are endless.

P.S. Shame on the user who dared to compare in his review this highly overrated series to Breaking freaking Bad one of the gems of the 21st century
