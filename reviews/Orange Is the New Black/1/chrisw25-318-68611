I'll be brief and to the point.

Like many, I anticipated the third season with hope to be entertained and to see characters develop through great story accompanied by great acting. I saw none of this. Season two frustrated me for five episodes before an actual story emerged. Season three, not only didn't bring a story, characters wandered aimlessly for thirteen painful-to-watch episodes before finally drowning in a lake. 

I'm not sure what Jenji Kohan and the writers were thinking when constructing the season. You have a main character in Piper and the best you can do is make her the king pin of a... used pantie business? Seriously? And what was the point of Alex Vauss? What was the point of most of the characters. We all know why Poussay got another season but I'll leave off-camera b.s. alone. THERE ARE TOO MANY CHARACTERS ON THIS SHOW, most of them useless and not contributing an ounce to the story. I said last season that you could cut the cast in half and still have the same outcome. The writing is as poor as it gets. The back stories of EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER was so awkward, most had hardly anything to do with, well, anything. 

So much for being brief. Suffice it to say, since watching this garbage that people seem to rate highly (Obviously those people haven't watched the masterpiece WENTWORTH), I've completely shut myself off from watching Season 4, hopefully the last season. Thirteen hours of my time this season can't be reimbursed by Netflix and I'm not about to invest any more.
