Imagine a local beauty parlour where the women are giving each other nail jobs, doing each others hair, exchanging beauty tips all the while gossiping and being shrill and loud. And oh! throw in a few bad words. Now imagine all of this happening inside a women's prison in the US. That is what the first season is all about. There is no substance behind this series. All the things that give women a bad rep (gossip, vanity, back, catty etc etc) have been clubbed together to create this show which is supposed to take place inside a prison. There is one episode dedicated to the fact that women have 3 holes !!! WTF is that about. In order to cater to as large an audience as possible, there are the lesbians, a trans gender, the straight ones, the Mexicans, the African Americans, the Russians etc. 

All in all do not waste your time on this show! If you really really want to watch women gossip and give each other hair dos and make-ups, just head to your local beauty parlour, wear an orange suit and pretend you're inside a prison.
