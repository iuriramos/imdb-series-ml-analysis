I will start with apologising to anyone that I insult with this review, but you do deserve it.

This show is the biggest steaming pile of crap that I have had the misfortune to see in my whole life, and what makes it even worse is that it has top reviews. I think that I would find the final stages of syphilis more entertaining than what I found this show.

I gave it a fair shot, I watched the first 3, well 2 and a half episodes and after half of the first I was skipping the flashbacks then in the second I was skipping 3/4 of the episode and by the time I was on the third episode I tortured myself by giving it one last shot and not skipping anything, but after 30 minutes I could bare no more and would have happily gouged my eyes out in favour of having to watch another minute.

The show is completely unrealistic, has no humour and has a story line that is as interesting as listening to a 5 hour lecture about paint drying.

I will not write any spoilers because I am trying my hardest to block all memory of this depressingly boring show out of my memory. 

I would just like to recommend to anyone thinking of watching this show to first make sure that they are ready to fall asleep within 30 seconds of the show starting.

I am actually quite impressed with the writers and producers of this show, not because of their filming and writing abilities, but because they somehow got this show aired and for at least 3 seasons. The only real reason I can come up with for this is that there must be some serious players involved and this show has been aired out of fear of reprisal.

I know this is more rant than review, and it will probably have the opposite effect to the desired and people will probably watch it just to see what my problem is, but I implore you, don't, you would enjoy having Hannibal Lecter feed you your own brain more.
