This show is just another attempt in a long line of race baiting by Hollywood's Jewish royal elite to distract us from their absurd over-representation in media, from AIPAC, and from the billions in donations to Israel from our country which is already trillions in debt, by attempting to make Americans bicker amongst themselves over petty issues of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. Naturally, Jenji Kohan grew up in Beverly Hills in a family already filled with television writers and producers, both as parents and siblings, so she was simply handed her career through nepotism rather than having to earn it through merit. That explains the trashy, boring plot and stereotypical characters. Despite Kohan's tremendously privileged life, she chooses to portray a middle class white gentile who could only dream of Kohan's life as the privileged one in her series, and despite famous examples like Bernie Madoff and the Wall Street crooks, there is naturally not a single Jew in the entire prison. Just blacks and whites bickering and acting crazy and/or stupid. The show is sure to get blacks and whites bickering in real life too, which is all Kohan is actually after, not to mention it's divisiveness of men versus women, gays versus straights, etc. It's just race baiting garbage.
