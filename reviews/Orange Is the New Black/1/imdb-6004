Caged women was schlock 40 years ago and hasn't improved. Surprising that NOW hasn't chimed in. 'Orange...' has uninteresting characters, bad writing (not good enough to be camp and with bad writing how can you comment on the acting?). In the opening scenes, Piper gives no reason to care for her dilemma, Larry has no warmth and seems to be mentally elsewhere. Is this the directors intent? All the faces in the credits were very interesting, possibly real inmates??? While I enjoy the occasional nudity in films, here (IMHO) nudity is wasted. Thinking of George Carlin's comments on the use of profanity, words have power but when you use them in every sentence the power is weakened because people become numb. The same applies to nudity and violence(ala Goodfellas).
