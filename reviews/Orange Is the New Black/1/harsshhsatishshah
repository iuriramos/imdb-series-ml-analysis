I have no clue who all liked this series. Its slow, boring, badly written, poor performances by mostly all characters. There are many good TV shows out there, this is definitely 1/10 rating I could not watch past 7 episodes of season 1 That too, I was forcing myself. It does not flow well and it tests your patience. I feel all those who have given it a thumbs up are not exposed to better cinema Its time people come up with honest ratings and reviews. Gosh, I hope the producers realize their mistake and don't make season 2 the choice of characters is bad, the plot is boring unlike other series where u cant wait to watch the next episode, this one bores the living guts out of you in an episode. Please please stop this torture
