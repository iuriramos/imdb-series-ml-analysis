I don't understand why I opted in the first place to watch this series created by the person who bored us to death with Weeds. The casting was ridiculous then and it is now.

Netflix has charmed with its recent House of Cards and the mega- hilarious Arrested Development. But, this is plain bland. The show starts with an imbecile female protagonist who looks seemingly obsessed to be incarcerated for a crime she committed 10 years ago. Her emotions seem fake and so does the characters who pop out like they have read books about prison life.

20 minutes into the first episode, I was tired of the boob show, lesbian sex talks, foreplay and ludicrous obscenity. It neither helped in surprising me nor attempted to make me laugh. A la Game of Thrones, I thought it would turn out to be an epic series, so I continued and was in for utter disappointment. The plot is very poor and so is the narration. The non- linear flashback screenplay is a gimmick.

BOTTOM LINE: This is a disappointment. Invest your time in some other classic comedies or few popular new shows by AMC, FX or even HBO. Avoid Orange is the New Black if you are a TV enthusiast who has a life.
