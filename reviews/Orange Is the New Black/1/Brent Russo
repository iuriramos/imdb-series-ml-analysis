I'm really surprised this show has been so well-reviewed. It's boring and obnoxious. I liked Kohan's show Weeds, so it's not that I can't appreciate the style or sensibility. The main problem with this show is that the characters are caricatures, like in a bad SNL skit, so they're unbelievable, unrelatable, and often insulting to the viewer's intelligence. The antagonists are particularly one-sided. I think the show is supposed to be mocking polite white bourgeois values, but I can't imagine anyone feeling like it accurately represents anything about anyone real, whatever their class, race, or gender. Also, by making the objects of its satire so absurdly unrealistic, I think the show actually obscures the social problems it pretends to be addressing.
