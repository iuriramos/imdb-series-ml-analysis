I hold this as exhibit A of pop culture gone wrong.

There is no redeeming feature to this series. No moral, no morals in point of fact.

This is a wildly tedious vehicle for the sole purpose of pandering to a deviant demographic.

Why a studio/production company would continue to pump out this literal tripe I cannot imagine.

Why an audience would watch it is equally baffling.

I would wish the producers well but that would neither be earnest nor helpful to our society.
