The views, mindsets and world represented in this show could only possibly grow in a proto-fascist society of barely humanoid sociopaths and psychopaths that is riddled with cancer-like deeply messed-up social rules, like it is the case in today's western, and doubly so, American society. From the insane obsession with the repression of any kind of emotions that could have others confuse one with an actual human being, over the countless ridiculous stereotypes shown, to the whole way the barbaric practice of imprisonment is presented.

If you are not a part of that cancerous culture, this show will deeply disgust you, and remind you, to never ever become part of that "culture", and never even travel there, until they have eradicated themselves. (Which is only a matter of time.)

At least nudity is sanely shown. (But still insanely judged.)

A stereotypical American will probably love the show for those exact reasons, because of how much he can see his own insane world and personality in it  and probably hate the nudity. LOL
