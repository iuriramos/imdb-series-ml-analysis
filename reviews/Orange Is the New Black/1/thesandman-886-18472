what a terrible show. really? why is it the black people have to be the uneducated degenerate people? steal,lie,cheat and don't care about anyone or authority. complete biased show. this has so much sex. my god! it's like every scene is a sex scene and the only character I liked was RED.just because, she has an accent and seems intelligent. a dirty hippie. (great t**s) and very very gay sex scenes. no problem with it. but, Jesus! does every scene have to be a bang scene? also, the acting isn't all that great. what an overrated show. awards? seriously? I'm writing a show. this cannot be completely true from the memoir. this is so far-fetched. no way in hell Soso is knocked out and no guard notices and no one says anything. give me a break! or how the guard p***ed out and got Pluto or whatever his name is with the stupid handlebar mustache and my god! pornstashe. is seriously the biggest douchebag in the world! I hate his character. what a sadistic piece of s*** touching and groping women,calling them names,being a jerk all the time.. this is the most overrated show I have ever seen. 1st season was the only good season.
