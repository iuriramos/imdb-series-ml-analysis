***SPOILERS***

Let's face it, OITNB was never a perfect show, but seasons 1 and 2 had just enough good acting and good laughs in them to make up for the soppy melodramatic stuff. I wasn't psyched to see the third season, but I was sort of looking forward to it. My wife and I saw the whole thing and afterwards we agreed:

Season three is an absolute cringe-worthy mess. It's so bad I don't know where to begin. No wait, I do: 

- There is WAY too much hugging and learning. Practically every character has been changed into a more or less intelligent and sensible/likable person (Pensatucky? Leanne? What the hell?), which, to be honest, made them all rather boring and whiny. 

- Flashbacks overload! The flashbacks are very dominant this season and often have zero sense of urgency, they just slow. everything. down..

- Hardly any of the story lines are interesting and the ones that are go on for too long. 

- Piper and Vause have 'evolved' into cardboard caricatures, which puts the weight of the show on the other characters, of which only a few act well enough to carry it. A positive note: Caputo remains a joy too watch, including the guard couple, and Gloria also does some decent acting but it's just not enough. Poussey Washington gets loads of screen time even though she's the worst actress on the show. Most of the other characters just suffer from the bad dialogue and pointless storyline they have to act their way out of. 

And to top things off:

- The final episode deserves extra mentioning because it's such a train wreck. Apart from it being pretty much incomprehensible because of all the weird story lines that needed finishing, it also contains a couple of the most embarrassing moments I've ever seen on television: Taystee's Jewish baptism being one of those, the ridiculous break out scene, Suzanne's love interest throwing a turtle, there's just no end to it. 

Of course there will be another season but I sure won't be watching that after having endured this pile of dung.
