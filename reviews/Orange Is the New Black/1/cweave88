If you want to see something unpredictable from the first episode. Well go watch Breaking Bad cause the main plot sucks. Everything that Piper wants she gets. She never has any bad news. It would make more sense if her fiancé, who fought the urge to cheat, cheated on her. From the first episode you realize shes going to get back with her ex Alex. I was really hoping this was going to be a good series and has a ton of potential and they just flush it down the drain. I wouldn't have seen it coming if she backed away from Alex cause she didn't want to be in the hole again, or if she realized that her fiancé was the right guy. Its a lesbian feminist show that holds no real plot twist. I mean the side stories are more interesting then the main one.
