SPOILER.

For me, this show is literally unwatchable. I stopped watching after episode three of the first season when it became obvious that the lead actress' horrible boyfriend's role was going to increase. What drew people in to watch this dreck? It couldn't have been the stupid bloody tampon in a muffin scene, because by the time that happened, WAS ANYBODY ACTUALLY SURPRISED? Really? A 'special' breakfast for the annoying new white girl? 

I started watching this while anticipating I would love it; the reviews are all stellar. So disappointing.
