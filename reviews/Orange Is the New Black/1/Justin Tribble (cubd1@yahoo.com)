Watching the first episode, I was expecting something pretty compelling:

the set up is this middle-class, uppity, dopey, clueless white-bread girl gets sent to prison.

you figure her world is about to crash down upon her. you figure the show will show her world unravel, and in the process watch her relationship with her boyfriend and family begin to disintegrate.

she's a criminal and she's going to jail. it's not going to be fun and games.

wrong. that's not where the show went at all!

the show is a silly soap opera, filled with gross humor and stereotyped characters. 

now I only watched the first few episodes, but from what I saw it was a total waste of time. it's just mental rubbish. that said, im sure some of the characters get more fleshed out as time goes on. im sure there's "more" to it. but this is not a serious drama. i was just hoping for a different tone to the show, something a little more sobering.

the main character also struck me as being incredibly annoying, so I was looking for her downfall. didn't seem to happen. 

not my cup of tea. seems like it belongs on NBC as a 30 minute sitcom. im shocked people are so wrapped up in it, then again, people love empire.
