I'm not a racist or something but I would like to be honest in my review, so please just take my review as a criticism of the series nothing more.

1- Too much Lesbian and non-straight stuff, sometimes I start thinking that the director and author are freaks.

2- Some scenes are really silly and makes me wanna vomit, mostly when the black ladies sit in a group and trying to be funny (are we supposed to laugh?)

3- meaningless Symbolism in show, e.g. showing us David Star in a very fast sketch while it means nothing!! What do you want to tell us? We always see the same in Adam Sandlar, Ben Stiller,.... Movies.. Community College Series fails after it was a success because it's full of Symbolism and it wasn't funny anymore.

4- Not the best actress for the act, some can be better.

5- Story is attracting, but the above points.
