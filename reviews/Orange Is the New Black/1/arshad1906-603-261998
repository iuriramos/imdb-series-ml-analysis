I thought this is a popular series, it must be at least good not expecting this to be awesome.... but after watching orange is the new black, I lost my faith in TV series..Piper chapman the lead of this TV series is so much confused, or the writer of orange is the new black is confused about piper... she don't know what she is up to, she is just lost... so much unnecessary lesbian drama is shown.. I really regret the time I have wasted on Orange is the new black... first season was at least fine...but from second season it was awful... no direction of the plot.. unnecessary characters, unnecessary stories for unnecessary characters...
