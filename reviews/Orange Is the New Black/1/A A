Bad acting, bad script, bad direction that's what Orange is new black about. Even Tom and Jerry makes more sense than this series does so don't waste time here. Cast selection makes very much sense looking at script, it is a masterpiece combination of terrible work. A script not making any sense, cheap dialogue and unnecessary cheap sex scenes. I could not force myself to complete season 1. I started watching it solely looking at its rating and learned a lesson here, i wont go for this writer and director again. May be i sound too harsh here for this TV series but once you have watched too many quality shows you simply can't bear this level of work. May be it is for starters but even starters will find some cartoon series a better choice.
