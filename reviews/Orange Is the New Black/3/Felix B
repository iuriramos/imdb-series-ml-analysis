It's a shame, because I initially really liked the show, the first season was so great, but I have to say that I stopped watching it in S4 (I just skipped many parts up until the finale).

I stopped as soon as I heard the show has been renewed for a 5th 6th and 7th! season, and after S3 and S4 (altough S4 was indeed better) there are plenty of shows out there worth watching, and OITNB is not one of them anymore.

There are basically 2 main reasons for that.

The show basically has become a daily soap in prison, there is in fact no main story line anymore, I even would go as far as to say that there is not even a single real story line anymore in the show. It's daily life in prison, seasoned with a little drama that goes nowhere, it feels exhausting, it feels like you are stuck with the characters in prison, waiting to do your time. I don't see where the show might go in the following seasons, but I don't care about endless cycles of soap- or telenovela-style story lines with dozens of characters.

And that brings me to the second main reason I stopped watching, the characters. I S1 the show had a main story line and some main characters, we were getting to know Piper (if you like her or not, I know her character is controversial, to say the least) and her transformation as she spent time in prison. In S3 and 4 that is all washed away by adding more and more characters without getting rid of old ones. It's even hard to recall all the names, let alone all their stories that are detailed way to much in dozens of useless flashbacks, and again lead nowhere. It's like the showrunners are thinking: "Well, we don't know what to do with the story line anyway, let's throw in even more characters". Unfortunately I stopped counting, and I stopped caring about them, it's just to much, it's like and endless mix.

I get that the show touches some recently important subjects regarding prison life, and the system in general, but that's not enough for me, farewell OITNB, I'm sorry.
