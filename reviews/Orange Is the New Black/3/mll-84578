What happened to Season 3? It lost it's depth! Even Piper has been reduced to vapidity. Episode after episode, I keep hoping it'll get better but there is nothing but shallow characters and story lines. Even the flashbacks, which is basically half of the episode, don't really contribute anything to augment or improve the story. It appears to simply be fillers to just come up with a 55 minute episode. I loved Seasons 1 and 2, and was really looking forward to Season 3. Unfortunately, I find myself bored with every single episode of this season. Even Taylor Schilling, who did commendable acting in the previous seasons, appears to be high on something, in season 3.

Sad!
