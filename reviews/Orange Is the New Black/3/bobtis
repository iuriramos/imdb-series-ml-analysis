I have to say season 3 has been a very big downer for me. It seems to me that had no real direction to take this show. The first 2 seasons were very good now the show has no direction. It mover from character to character side bar to side bar with no con conclusion. Any real thread is never resolved. Then in the last episode then make it seem we have to wait for the next season to find out what happens when they will still not address anything. Little did I know the the Fed DOC contracts out the management of our prisons to people with NO training. Now watch the last episode and tell me what a waste of time that was. Don't know how Netflix works it but the series needs an ending. NOW> in season 4.

Thank you.
