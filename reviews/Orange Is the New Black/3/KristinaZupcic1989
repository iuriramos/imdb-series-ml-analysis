1st season was interesting,made me wanna see more, but the 2nd season is crap, full of girl power/feminism/f***all men/lesbian lobby?!/ superficial motivating stuff so that's why I rated it 3. It would be 1(awfull) but character of "Red",Galina Reznikov by Kate Mulgrew is pretty good, great Russian accent. Mendez was my hero, had some really funny quotes like the one with the Jesus,brought that black humor-hillbilly jerk feeling and maybe he was a man they could actually fight, show their "rights", but hey, you totally excluded him from 2nd season and put a lot of Jason Biggs whose only purpose was to put me to sleep. Too much drama, I thought this is a comedy series.
