I loved season 1 and 2, I couldn't get enough, but season 3 was a big disappointment. Nothing really happens and is very boring. Seems that the pattern follows the tragedy that happened with "Weeds" which had such a good start and then from season 3 it all went downhill. They should have stop while they were ahead. I liked that the story had Piper as the main character, now she is almost absent, and the relationship with Alex is so illogic! How could she forgive her so easy after she let her rot in prison? Because she loved her so much, right? Wrong! The first cute girl she see and she cheat on Alex and then she makes a perfect tattoo on herself without mirror or any knowledge on the matter. Please. And who was the little girl that almost died or the boy in front of the church? Whose memories were? Made no sense.And it seems they cannot afford any quality wig for any character in this movie.
