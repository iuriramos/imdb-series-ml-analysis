I give season one a 10. Season two a six and season three a 3. 

Season 2 and 3 get real boring when the supporting actors start getting tube time. In these seasons, time rolls back as you see how what these supporting actors did as a child or what landed them in jail. They are not great actors which is all the more reason not to put them in the limelight. But worse, their life stories are mediocre at best. 

Sorry but this show went down the tubes after season 1. I am guessing there are new writers or something. Not sure but pretty sure no awards will be given out for season 2 or 3.

Definitely watch season one. Then move on to other shows like Wentworth on the same steaming network.
