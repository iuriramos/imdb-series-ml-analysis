Season 3= major disappointment!! After watching the first episode of season 3, I immediately became alarmed that perhaps the show had lost it's magic. Still, I continued to hold onto the hope that it was just a slow beginning which would work itself into something spectacular. Unfortunately, that was not to be. I found that most episodes of season 3 just mull along, extending the agony of watching for something great to happen, which never really does. There are a few notable exceptions along the way, in particular a brief cameo of a sniveling, whiny Pornstache when his mother visits him in prison. After waiting such a long time for the new season, one would expect the series to come back with a bang.. unfortunately, to say the show came back with a whimper is a gross understatement. This, coming from a HUGE FAN of Kenji, her previous much beloved series Weeds, and seasons 1 & 2 of Orange Is The New Black. Avoiding comment on any particular story line in the 3rd season in an effort to avoid spoilers for those who have not finished watching yet. In a rare show of support, when a show has seemingly jumped the shark, I am actually hoping in this case that the show will come back for a 4th season, with Kenji taking the show back to what made it such a smashing success to start with. When it was good, it was GREAT!! I would certainly be willing to give a 4th season a chance
