I am losing interest in this series after the screwdriver and the chicken episode. Shouldn't there be rapes by the prison guards? What happened to the unnecessary strip searches? This just doesn't seem to be a typical prison life. It's more about having parties and doing whatever in this show. What boyfriend in his right mind wouldn't tell his girlfriend the truth about her ex-girlfriend squealing on her? Doesn't make sense. Could be better story if they follow the book.

Maybe I'll switch to House of Cards. Then again, it could be because I'm not into female stories. Wassup with this review forcing me to spell out words in full?
