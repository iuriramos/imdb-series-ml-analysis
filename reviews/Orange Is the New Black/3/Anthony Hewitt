Just as I start to get engaged with this series, another flashback interrupts the narrative. I suppose I should be grateful that it uses this antiquated technique - it would have been even worse if it had a voice-over instead.

The lethargic pace ruins the comedy. Compare it to "Nurse Jackie", another comedy set in a dysfunctional institution. Admittedly having the outstanding Edie Falco as Nurse Jackie helps, but the snappy pacing counts for a lot. In comparison, Orange is the New Black just drifted from scene to scene.

I started watching this in an optimistic frame of mind. It had good reviews and how can you go wrong with a comedy set in a women's prison? I lasted one and a half episodes before I gave up.
