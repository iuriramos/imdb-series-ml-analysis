I enjoyed this Netflix exclusive immensely. The first episode was maybe a little slow, but once the characters are in place, they are really well developed, and supported by an excellent cast of actors (well, mostly actresses), and this is the show's main quality. It's really easy to feel a connection to them and, individually at least, they go beyond the usual clich√©s.

Collectively, that's a different story. With very, very few exceptions, inmates are depicted as victims of society. (Interestingly, Piper, the show's main protagonist, escapes the victim label: she participated in drug smuggling for love and for the fun of it). In contrast, the penitential system in general, is comprised of nothing but a bunch of deranged, nasty, greedy, dishonest or downright criminal employees. Now, I see myself firmly on the liberal side of the political spectrum, but I nonetheless was left scratching my head at the silly simplistically angelic view of crime. Conservatives will likely be outraged, and maybe with good reasons. 

So, one's enjoyment of "Orange is the new black" is very much dependent on the level on which you read the show. As the human story of a group of women who are forced to live together in a difficult environment, it's a resounding success. As political commentary, however, it suffers from a cruel lack of nuance. I decided to stick to the first level and am therefore looking forward to the second season.
