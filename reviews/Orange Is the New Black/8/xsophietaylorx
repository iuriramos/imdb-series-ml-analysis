Orange is the new black never appealed to me at all but I saw so many people talking about it that I thought I just needed to try give it a watch. I was pleasantly shocked the episodes are all actually really funny and the story line is fresh and keeps you watching I enjoyed watching orange is the new black a lot and grew fond off different characters I liked how each episode related to one character so we learnt about them so in the end you felt you knew a lot about them all. I can't wait for the new season and really would recommend that everyone gives this programme a chance. Even men can enjoy this all thought it is more aimed at women. It can give you a different perspective on life it's exciting to watch and you can tell why it has such a big fan base people should definitely watch.
