I love this show

The story line is amazing and the development of the characters is so intriguing

The way how each episode tells the audience how each prisoner landed in gaol is extremely interesting and it lets the viewer grow closer to the prisoners.

The writers are also extremely hilarious, some people might not find it funny but there are these one liners in the most inappropriate times that just make a person laugh (namely me)

This show is amazing funny and sad, I encourage you to watch
