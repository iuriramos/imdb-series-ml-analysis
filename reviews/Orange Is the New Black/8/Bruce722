I just finished watching season one of Orange is the New Black﻿ and I was surprised with how good the show was. The cast of characters are all interesting and well acted. The production is top notch and the directing is flawless. The writing isn't clichéd at all. The protagonist is so real and imperfect that the show isn't predictable but there are hints at plot points early on showing how well the show was planned out. Taylor Schilling﻿ plays the main character and she does an incredible job. I'm not too familiar with her as an actress but there are times when she looks almost like a blonde Katy Perry﻿. I also really like the way the show's story is told. It takes almost a Lost﻿ approach by introducing you to characters through their past, via flashbacks. The show is crude and sometimes obscene so it isn't for everyone but I think most people would quite enjoy it.
