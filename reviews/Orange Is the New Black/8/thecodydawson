First of all, I love the show. It has cool characters, a very powerful and interesting story, and a good matching soundtrack. Personal comments: I would strongly suggest being hardily mature minded and prepared for certain content. Not to spoil anything, but this show does contain quite a bit of language, sex, a little violence, and some general darkness in the atmosphere. However, it is still enjoyable if the preceding things do not bother you that much. Overall, I would say 8 out of 10. Definitely not perfect, but pretty dang good! Knowing that this is based on a young woman's real life and experiences in prison makes it all the more interesting. I would also suggest reading the book first. It is called "My Year in a Woman's Prison" (OITNB), you can buy it on Amazon in paper-back, and I think e-book now as well. I loved the book, it makes the show even better! Anywho, dive on in, IF you're fully prepared to face:

Some dark emotional content A little violence (not TOO much) Quite a bit of sexual content & general nudity Large amounts of intense language An atheist protagonist character And overall to be addicted to an thrilling yet heavy story!:)
