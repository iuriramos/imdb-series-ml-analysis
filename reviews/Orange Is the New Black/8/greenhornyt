I have enjoyed Orange since making it through the first episode. After 3 seasons i would give it a 9.5 rating. Its obvious that Jenji Kohan or whatever his name is who created this masterpiece has been using this show as a platform to make the white girls look like trash. Typical reverse racism that is so prevalent these days. In season 4 he has taken this fantasy of his to a new level. For this blatant attempt to make white people look bad, i give it a more deserved 8. If he would stop this hatred towards whites this show would be a 10. I think its wrong for anyone to instigate hatred especially in media. Other than that the story is always interesting. Its too bad he portrays so many individuals as hateful.
