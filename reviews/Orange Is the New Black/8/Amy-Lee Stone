The ending of Season 3 was honestly disappointing. I loved Season 1 and 2 though. Okay, so I really expected Bennett to come back (or at least make some appearance) in the final episode, but no. I can't believe they just dropped a main character like that with no word of why or where he went. They built him up to be this sweet, sensitive guy who shared mad love with Daya and the baby. He proposed to Daya, reassuring her that they would live happily ever after like a loving family, and then he literally just disappeared. If he doesn't return in Season 4 I'm going to be so upset. Also I hate how piper did that to Ruby Rose, it was so uncalled for. She sabotaged Ruby and made her go to max prison I mean wtf is up with that! I understand that she betrayed Piper but there were other ways to fix the issue, rather then destroying her only chance at freedom. And another thing, where were Piper, Heily and Caputo in the last 10 minutes of the finale? Where were they when everyone escaped and jumped in the river?

The last time we saw Sophia was when she got escorted to the shoe which was a few episodes back. She was definitely one of my favourites so hopefully she returns and isn't completely forgotten about, which seems to be a common error of Jenji Kohan's. I noticed it a lot in Weeds, too. I'm really praying that Nicki, Bennett, Mendez, Ruby, Sophia and a few others are apart of Season 4, otherwise I believe OITNB will suffer a lot of negative reviews. I mean, seriously. We don't need anymore new characters. Still, I find myself constantly laughing while watching this show. It's honestly so enjoyable to watch and I can't get enough of it. Pretty cruel making us wait 10 months for new episodes. For what shall i do with my life now?
