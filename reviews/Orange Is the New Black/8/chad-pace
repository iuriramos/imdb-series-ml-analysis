Jason Biggs is becoming harder and harder to watch. He can only play one role; he's always going to be that awkward cynic that started all the way back in American Pie. His portrayed personality type doesn't quite mix with that of his on-screen fianc√© - he doesn't quite have that compassion-mixed-with-doubt magic that borders insensitivity of not played well. He attempts to close this gap with his humorous style, but this sort of snippy cynicism in the face of he and Piper's contemporary problems? Later down the line his role only becomes more problematic, and his troubles turn into a displeasing sideshow. Here's to hoping that this story arc will end soon! Cheers
