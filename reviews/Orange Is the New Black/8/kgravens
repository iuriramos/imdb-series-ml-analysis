Orange is the New Black is a completely new age of comedy coming to light. I have been pleasantly surprised by the attachment I got to the inmates and the amazingly different backgrounds that the writers are able to think up. What I like most is the way they portray the race division in prison. While it is sad that they are divided by the color of their skin, it is also quite understandable to put the inmates with what they probably know best. I like the little white girl group which consists of Yoga Jones, Alex, Pennsatucky, Big Boo, Nicky and Morello. They are all funny and amazingly different in their own ways. I am annoyed with Piper as she is whiny and self absorbed in her own problems as well as Leanne who constantly thinks she's the boss of everyone (the reasons I didn't give this show a 10). I am also quite found of the African American girls. Taystee, Poussay, Black Cindy, Janee and Crazy Eyes give this show so much comedic relief and ridiculousness that it is hard not to love them. I also love the Hispanics. They all are so much smarter than they are given credit for. Lastly, Red. She to me is one of the best characters. Her strength and perseverance as well as her attitude, wisdom, and red lipstick make this an amazing addition to show.
