I wasn't sure what to expect from Orange is the new black. I really liked House of Cards which was a Netflix original show too. I figured to give them another chance and it really paid off. This show is so unique with many controversial topics. It's based on a group of women and how they live and interact with each other in upstate New York prison. The actors are believable and their story lines are catchy. The story is loosely based on a true story also made it interesting as well. The directing is great and I can't wait for the next season. Watch it and appreciate how great these new television shows are becoming.
