What I love most about this show is the characters and the character development. With every episode I feel very connected with each and every one. Every one has a very individual and unique personality- even the not so likable characters like Dogget and Pornstache make you laugh. The only character I do not like in the slightest is actually the main protagonist, Piper. She's the only one who really gets under my skin because she's extremely self-centered, narcissistic and has no perspective on how much better she has then a lot of the inmates. She's white, rich and only serving 15 months, the other inmates are doing much longer and she always seems like an ungrateful bitch to me. She also can't seem to make up her mind about whether she wants to be with Vause, and I really like Vause a lot so I wish Piper would make a choice and stick with it. I really love how each episode contains flashbacks dedicated to one character. It helps understand their history and what drives them to keep on going and living. There is a lot of humor, and what I really love about the humor as it's based on reality, as opposed to unbelievable goofiness. The only criticism I have, which is what made me give this show 8 stars, instead of 10- is how unrealistic the prison setting is. I completely understand that they have to make it more appealing because it's a show- but some things I saw and I was thinking, "Really? That would never happen in real life." So, a lot of unrealistic things happen, some big, some small- there are too many to list but it was enough for it to lose one star. The loss of the other star comes from my extreme dislike for the protagonist Piper, I feel as though she doesn't ever fight back and acts weak until season 2 which is really frustrating. She makes a lot of dumb decisions and every time she speaks I want her to shut up. Same thing goes for Larry. Other than those things, this show is golden.
