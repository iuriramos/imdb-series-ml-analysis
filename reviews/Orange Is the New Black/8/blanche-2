Netflix has produced another winner - Orange is the New Black sports a terrific cast, quirky characters, interesting stories -- I really enjoyed the first season.

Based on the memoir of Piper Kerman, the story concerns one Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a young woman who, ten years earlier, had a romantic relationship with another woman, Alex Vause (Laura Prepon) and transported drug money for her.

Now, ten years later, Piper is engaged to Larry Bloom (Jason Biggs), but someone has turned her into the Feds and she is sentenced to 15 months in a minimum security prison. It comes as quite a shock to just about everyone -- that she transported drug money and was a lesbian. Or, as Piper puts it later, on a sliding scale.

Once in prison, the adjustment is brutal. There's the cook, a Russian woman (an unrecognizable Kate Mulgrew) who starves Piper out after Piper insults the food; Crazy Eyes (Uzo Aduba), who's in love with her and difficult to deal with when she doesn't get what she wants; Big Boo (Lea DeLaria), a tough lesbian; a born again Christian who is on the edge (Taryn Manning) and is Piper's nemesis, and many others. There's also the drug-dealing guard, the homophobic counselor with his mail order Russian bride, the mother and daughter (she gets pregnant by one of the guards) -- lots going on.

Meanwhile, Piper's fianc√©, a fledgling writer, tries to deal with the separation and the fact that Alex is in prison with Piper.

Along the way, we see flashbacks that start to tell us how the women got there.

The acting overall is very believable, each character fully fleshed out, each on her own journey. I have a friend with a small part in the show, Lin Tucci, and she does a wonderful job.

A truly excellent series with many layers, graphic in parts, and fascinating. The first season ends with a cliffhanger -- can't wait for the second.
