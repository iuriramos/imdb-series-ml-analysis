Netflix has been in the spotlight recently with their releases of both House of Cards and Arrested Development in full seasons. After finishing both I couldn't wait to see what else they had lined up and once I heard that Jenji Kohan was on board I was sold. Being a fan of Weeds I expected nothing less than well written strong female roles and tons of F-bombs being dropped to come from Kohan's next project. Orange is the new Black is about Piper Chapman and her untimely sentence to an all female penitentiary. She must deal with adapting to her new prison life while also having to maintain a relationship outside with her recent fianc√©. I had just finished the first season and was taken back and how well so many of the characters were developed in just 13 hour long episodes. In the beginning it does feel like the show doesn't quite know it's own tone, but just around 4 episodes in it becomes a fun drama with plenty of unique characters. A definite recommendation to anyone who is looking for a summer series to watch!
