When this show was nominated for a Golden Globes for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama and also won AFI Awards for TV Program of the Year I had to see it. The first few episodes I found a bit boring but the more you watch it you'll gradually enjoyed it right up to the last episodes. The show contain many characters and each of them has their own stories how they end up in prison. You going to love and hate some of them by the end. Some review stated that this show has too much nudity, sex scenes and lesbian reference. Believe me this is nothing compare to Game of Thrones and The L Word. Watching Jason Biggs as Larry Bloom; Piper Chapman fianc√© is like watching him in American Pie as Jim Levenstein. The way he act and the way he talk and even his nerdy personality. Overall I look forward to Season 2.
