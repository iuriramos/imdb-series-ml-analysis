As expected they screwed this up. Horrible casting - Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are iconic as Riggs and Murthaugh. The new Riggs is some kind of wacky clown, and who came up with the brilliant idea casting Damon Wayans in this?

I figured I would give this show the benefit of the doubt. But I knew this was going to bomb the very first scene, when new wacky Riggs appeared. He is over the top crazy in a wacky way, and just a bad, bad version of the original Riggs.

To be honest, I didn't like Lethal Weapon 4, but the first two films are two of the best pieces of action cinema ever. This show takes a dump on all of the originals. Why can they never leave anything alone? Or at least, make it a a good reboot?
