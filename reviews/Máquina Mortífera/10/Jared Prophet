Before Mel Gibson was a complete mess, 3 of the 4 movies were fun. But after the 4th movie I was done with the series and haven't watched any of them since it hit video. It was a classic rock reunion tour of state fairs. They got the band back together and played all of their hits. 

Lethal Weapon 4 was the best example of why reboots are often better choices for franchise that have been dormant for a long time. Instead of bringing back aged actors and their last love interest and trying to finagle a story that will give each returning actor enough screen time, it is often best just to recast, and write a new story that keeps the best elements of what made the previous version work, while discarding the dead weight. 

Not that there was all that much time between LW 3 and LW 4, so really there is no excuse for how bad it was, but also Indiana Jones 4 is a prime example. And why GB3 works so well. 

The Lethal Weapon TV show, which I had very low expectations for, was hitting it out of the park amazing. The casting was top notch. Danny Glover is great, but the role seems to fit Damon Wayans so much better. And Clayne Crawford is able to hit ALL of the emotional notes that the character needs to hit. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in End of Days, I never for a second believed that Mel Gibson's Riggs was suicidal. (My theory has always been that End of Days was written for Bruce Willis.)

And the rest of the cast is great too. I am seeing a lot of faces I know who can pull off their scenes in the coming episodes as the show jells. Cops and family. 

The emotional beats in this first episode happen a little on the fast side, but they only had 42 minutes to get through them all. 

When the episode ended I was sad that I have to wait a whole week to get more Murtaugh and Riggs. 

This is TV, so they generally get a lot more time to work on the pilot than on any other episode, but this looks to be the most kick- ass show of the fall season.
