Damon Wayans and Clayne Crawford are an excellent team! I was expecting to see their dynamic energy fizzle. It doesn't. Instead, it pulls me into their story to the point the reality at the Murtaugh dinner table makes me want to get up and make dinner. The sound and set lighting are interesting the way they interact, weave the light to grainy almost sometimes too dark. Enter not only interaction family funny side, there's an adorable baby! The chase, and shoot out scenes aren't over done like other cop shows. There are a lot of other programs in the same day and time slot impacting viewer totals. Given a chance, I see "Lethal Weapon" going the distance because its feels real with real people. Great casting. Good story. There is good balance between heavy and light in the air as well as in the heart.
