This is a great reboot of a classic movie series. I would love to see cameos from original cast at some point. Please support this show. I would love to see it turn into a movie one day. PLEASE Don't CANCEL The cast is fresh and the timing is perfect. Great mix of action and music. I grew up watching Martin and Briggs and feel like I am discovering them all over again. I feel like we get more back story in this version than we did in the original and that is great. I would like to rave on and on, but this series is still fresh and each episode tops the last. To the writers I applaud all you do. Keeping it true to it origins but taking it to the next level at the same time. Keep up the good work and I am really looking forward to see where you take the series.....aka JoE PESCHI
