Im not going to dig through everything. All i have to say is, that this series is a combination of action, drama and humor with true sadness of one of the main protagonists. For me this is one of the best new series to date for last 3 years (along with Lucifer). Actors are really good, scenery is also great and every episode has a plot with new development, not just a classic crime drama - killer, detectives, suspects, twist, twist, end. This series is more complex with some more real-brutal aspects of crime. Don't believe the haters. Its really good, i'd recommend it to anyone who liked Mel Gibson's existencional crisis in the old movies. Tune in, watch the first episodes and have a good time. Cheers, enjoy.
