I never thought the series would live up to the movie, but I watched the 1st episode anyway. Well, I have not missed an episode. Wayan & Clayne are better than Glover & Gibson in the same roles. That is saying a lot!! I have never seen Clayne Crawford in anything, but he is fantastic in this show. This show must be a keeper. I look forward to each & every episode. It is funny & the action is great. Once again, Clayne Crawford plays his role perfectly. Looking forward to the rest of season one & this must return for season two. The supporting actors fill their roles very well. The writers for the show do a great job in allowing its stars to do their thing. Clayne Crawford should get future opportunities in Hollywood based on his performances in this series.
