Amazing! I didn't think anything could make this better. So real and the pain in Riggs and the tears. WOW! I cried along with him. Since in the movie we didn't know or see how his wife and baby died, this was heartbreaking. But now we know too, why he is so torn up and also about the fall-out and the why. Loved Damon and how real he and his wife are and how the whole cast plays off each other. Baby is adorable. When Riggs held her, oh my. The pain in his face and the love. Such pain for his character to have to go through. I don't want to miss an episode. This is going to be a winner! Thank you so much for surprising us with this wonderful show. Can hardly wait til next week!
