I watch a lot of t.v. and I read a lot. I was unable to sleep so I figured I would watch Lethal Weapon, I was never really a fan of the movies but this show impressed me. The chemistry that exists between the main characters is astounding.

Being a Disabled Veteran myself and having suicidal ideation I could empathize with how Riggs felt - the way his character expressed himself actually made me tear up twice.

Damon Wayans made me laugh - when his birthday gift was going to get pushed to when he is 60.

The way Riggs ate at the table reminded me of chow in the service. Not sure when you were gonna get another meal, so you eat what you can, when you can.

The way the different characters interacted was amazing, so much so that I look forward to the next installment. 

People need to remember that just because someone has psychological issues or are damaged in some way, that we need them around. Those people remind us why we get up in the morning, and do what we do.
