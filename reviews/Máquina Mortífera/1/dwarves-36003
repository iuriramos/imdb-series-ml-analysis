In a world where the phrase " If it ain't broke, don't fix it" has been replaced by " If it ain't broke, use it in a way that was not meant for its original purpose", I am no longer surprised by the way Hollywood big wigs are trying to rake in the dough. Lethal Weapon is no exception; the former buddy cop genre action movie franchise that has been a good watch at Christmas time has now turned into a cheesy, terribly acted out, poorly directed television show that lacks in both creativity and interest. We all know what the characters are going to do because we have already seen the movies!!!!! People who think that this show is somewhat good are is legitimately watchable are idiots who will watch anything that was made over thirty years ago and has now been remade into a terrible nostalgia fest. Nothing will save this show; It will be canceled. Don't listen to the naysayers my ass!
