It's crime that I have to write 10 lines about this series. The characters are, unfunny,boring and incredible nagging. The sparing back and forth between the two leads,which is suppose to be funny,falls flat to the ground. There really isn't much chemistry between them either. It's like they scraped the actors C-list for who ever demanded the smallest paycheck, and decided to hire them. 

It might have worked as something,if they just called it something else than Lethal Weapon. But by calling it that,they are bound to get compared to the original,and end up failing. If we're lucky they cancel it before the end of the year. I will never understand why someone decided,this was a good script to throw money at.
