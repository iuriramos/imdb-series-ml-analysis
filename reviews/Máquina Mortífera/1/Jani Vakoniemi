I'm a huge fan of Lethal Weapon movies, so I was excited to see this. For five minutes. When "the new Martin Riggs" appeared. He is trying too much. Mel Gibson portrayed Riggs to the point as a maverick on the loose. This guy is like his jealous little brother who is trying to top the craziness, without really scratching the surface. He tries, poorly. I have been also fan of Damon Wayans action movies, but as Murtaugh... No... The chemistry (which was the point of the Leathel Weapon movies) just isn't there. Why did they put that heart surgery aspect on this? So Murtaugh would be weak? Otherwise Damon Wayans would be too young looking and in good condition to play veteran police? Too cool to be afraid of death? They should have change the character names and series name and just gone with that. Why spoil the name Lethal Weapon? Why?
