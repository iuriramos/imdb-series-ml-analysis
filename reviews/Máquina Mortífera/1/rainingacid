I could go on and on but I'll simply say this...... 

Don't bother. It pulls down it's pants and does a big steamy crap all over your beloved Lethal Weapon Movies.

It's an insult to them. It's an insult to Danny To Mel. To Richard Donner. It's annoying me that i have to write 10 lines about to even warm you not to watch this.

No chemistry between the two leads Total D List actors Scripts that look like they were borrowed from old 80s Knight Rider Episodes.

Steer Well Clear of this TV poison.

This is TV at it's worst a huge step backwards.....

Believe me when I say this show will be cancelled, very very soon.
