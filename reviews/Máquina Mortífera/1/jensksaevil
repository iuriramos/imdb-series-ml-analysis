My review of this series.

If someone are to make a series of this, first of all set it in the right time period, and don't make it a comedy, but a drama which the franchise already is. And cast some actors that can actually play the part. I saw the first episode and this not a very good casting choice and director's choice in my opinion. The thing that disappoint me the most is the mistake of the time period from the franchise, It makes me sad to see such a big franchise looked down upon. Don't cast a former comedian and an unknown bad actor who can't live up to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's standards as actors. And please cast someone who at least looks the age and fits both of the main characters descriptions. And make at least both of the main characters read the book by Sanford Meisner "On method acting", #livetruthfullyinyourownimagination. I know there's a lot of people who don't like Mel Gibson anymore, but come on let's give the guy some respect for one of the biggest parts which opened a door in to Shakespeare for him
