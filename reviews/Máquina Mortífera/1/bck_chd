Let me start out by saying I really wanted to love this show. I was sooooo excited before watching the pilot. That excitement did not last long at all. Within the first 5 min that excitement changed to complete utter disappointment. The lead actors are miscast. Damon Wayans who is a mediocre actor at best is a comedian so how can he play the straight guy? The other guy with the mustache is trying waaaaay to hard and has none of Mels charm. There isn't any chemistry between the two leads. The chemistry between Gibson and Glover is what made the movies so great (well the first two were really great the last two not so great at all). The jokes are forced the action is so so. A lot of dead bodies but nobody accounts for any of them? I know this is a TV show but they shoot people and go out for a date night like its no big deal. I mean there would be investigations in every person they shot or at least some paperwork to fill out. The last thing I have to mention and maybe its just me is the actress Jordanna Brewster. How does she get acting roles? I am assuming she is going to be the hot beautiful love interest of the mustache guy but she is not either hot nor beautiful. She is sickly skinny. Her acting is just awful. She must be married to a big time producer in Hollywood. I really don't know what TV show the positive reviewers watched but its definitely not the Lethal Weapon TV show I did. Maybe they watched the movies and thought they were the TV show.
