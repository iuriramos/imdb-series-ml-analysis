Yes, its time to be unoriginal, "again" and churn out yet another retread. 

This time its an abysmal TV series knock off, of the excellent Lethal Weapon films. Unlike the original flicks, which enjoyed phenomenal chemistry between Mel Gibson's, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, played by Danny Glover, the new series is flatter than a week old souffl√©. 

There's no real chemistry between the main characters and worse still, the plot line is, in my view, as hackneyed as hell. Simply put, this is, I feel, a pale imitation of the original films. 

My advice take a trip back to the late 80's and watch the Lethal Weapon films. They really defined the action "buddy team up" genre. Three out of ten from me.
