The first 11 or so minutes of the episode 1 were there to try and draw you into the show and keep you there...to me, the first 11 minutes showed me how bad this series is..... OK, they have the money and fancy camera work, but....but very blah.... same old TV series with a new cover....same old typical script....lame writing...

It's almost as bad as what they tried to with Rush Hour some months back, but not quite as bad, but I do expect that it will most likely be canceled.

I did stay til the end of the episode to see if it had any saving grace....nope, not really.....there is so much good TV out there that I should waste time to watch something so mediocre.....And no, neither of the actors came even close to the magic that Mel Gibson & Danny Glover had, but they did do a better job of it than the actors that filled Jackie Chan's & Chris Tucker's shoes in the failed Rush Hour series.

Interesting result in the 573 votes cast so far...twice as many males watched..... the females gave the series the same high rating across all age groups....but the older the male, the less he thought of it...

I outright dismiss the %36 that gave this a 10 out of 10....There is very little, if anything at all, that deserves 10 out of 10! 10 out of 10 is something that is perfect, and if this is episode is "perfect" for you........nuf said
