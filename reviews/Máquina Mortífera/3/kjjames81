Why, why, why.

Nobody wanted this to be made, it's been quite a few years since the last lethal weapon film was out and it did okay in the cinemas around the world and to me it is years to late.for a series to come out. Yes to most people the first lethal weapon film was the best and always will be as the film's progressed the the title character became less lethal as it went on, so why a television series after all this time? To me and most people you cannot get another pairing like Gibson and Glover. So by the time this series came out, the title character should be as soft as a kitten and there would be no point of the series. Yes I can see why the actors.are doing this but let's look at the transporter series and the last film, which bombed by the way, what next a new lethal weapon film, no please let's get something new here not another 're run.
