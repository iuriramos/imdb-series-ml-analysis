At first, after watching a trailer I thought this show was going to be really dumb. I have to admit, due to nothing else on I gave this show a try. I found that I was actually entertained. It had action and humor. Of course its not the original and I think if folks put the original out of their minds when watching this show then they will find a fresh, entertaining show to watch this fall. With so many of my shows that I have been loyal to for years, such as Criminal Minds, having so many changes that I really don't like, I was glad to find another show that I could pass the time with and I actually enjoyed. It's not going to be for everyone, but it wasn't bad and I found that I actually liked it.
