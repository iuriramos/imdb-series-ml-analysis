Lethal Weapon is truly a great show that has lots of potential not just for one season but multiple seasons in the future. Lethal Weapon may be named from the "Lethal Weapon" movie series but whats amazing about the TV series is that you do not have to know or watch the 80s movies to know whats going on in the show which is amazing. Lethal Weapon is a fun show which contains lots of action and the actors in the are not bad they all fit the roles very well. The network company (FOX) has done a great job with this show so far and i am hoping to see more of this show in the coming years. Critics may not like this show because its based from movies (and there a bunch of old people who do not know what there talking about) but if you watch the show ignore its past and glory viewers will really enjoy this show and its potential.
