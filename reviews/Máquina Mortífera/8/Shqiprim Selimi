Okay i have seen the lethal weapon with Mel Gibson and Dany Glover but the the first episode was good its has some problems but i like the beginning was good the story was know to me but it was good and scene when Martin Riggs played by Clayne Crawford was driving and chasing the criminal and his wife call him and told him that he will become dad his adrenaline goes high and when he take the bad news about his wife accident it was a good act and i like it because he become a different person a person that has nothing to lose anymore because hi lost a reason for live and for the first episode i give 8 the comedy was good the act was not so bad so i think this TV show must go continue
