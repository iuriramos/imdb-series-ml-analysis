A Texas cop relocates to L.A. in order to start life a-new; and is partnered with an LAPD detective whodue to a "minor" heart attackmust avoid stress. I really wasn't interested in watching this show... at all. I like Damon Wayans and his brothers and have followed their work. So I was bored one night and said, what the heck! I'm so glad I watched it and here I am after the 2nd episode on IMDb writing my first review. I don't watch many cop shows, last one was 'Southland' and before that, 'The Shield'. I really like this show, the actors, the chemistry between the actors and the story line so far. Looking forward to next week, forget the naysayers, they obviously didn't watch the show and are just being trolls and haters.
