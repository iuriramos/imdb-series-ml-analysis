Lethal Weapon, the movie, wasn't all about bombast. Well, it mostly was, but it was overlaid with the persona of Martin Riggs as played by Mel Gibson and smoothed out by Glover's great Roger Murtaugh. So even while it was action packed, often in the extreme, it was a movie about two very different police partners and their relationship. 

As if to be 100% certain the bombastic action part is covered the TV series Lethal Weapon begins quite over-the-top. But, we don't have any reference to whoever this is playing Riggs (at least I don't). Maybe this is kind of understood by the writers and producers so in short order the character is built up in quite reckless 'git 'er done" fashion. We're being assured, if at light-speed, , that Clayne Crawford is your new Mel Gibson Riggs and you're gonna like him.. It's being force fed and you don't really have time to pick out the holes that may, or may not, exist. It helps immensely that when we're introduced to Roger Murtaugh it's Damon Wayans. You might not feel comfortable yet with Crawford, but Wayans fills Danny Glover's shoes perfectly because you'd pick him yourself.

Just when you're finally beginning to invest in this new version in record time we get another big action scene that cements the new Riggs character to seal the deal.. The fact that your right brain tells you Riggs would have been killed in the first five minutes fades away. Stupid bombast aside, this brilliantly inserts the viewer into the new version of the Lethal Weapon franchise. This is a crazy ride you're going to want to take. There's even another top-shelf action scene involving the Grand Prix of Miami for good measure. Actually, this is a bit too out- there apologetically, but it's so much fun to watch. Crawford and Wayans have the magic that is Riggs and Murtaugh, and even more than the crazy situations, wilder action scenes, and deft dialog, that is exactly why Lethal Weapon worked in the first placeÂ…And, still does.
