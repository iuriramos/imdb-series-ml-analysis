The show has potential and that people need to not compare it to the movies as the reason it is on TV is due to the fact, you can give a script and character development to grow.

Clayne Crawford is Martin Riggs as he lost his wife and unborn baby in car wreck in Texas. Just as he is ready to become a father. But then he has been the suicidal cop in the picture that Mel Gibson portrays him in. Leaving to go to LA to get a fresh start.

Comedian Damon Wayans as Roger Murtaugh who adds humor as well as the perfect "straight guy" and foil for Riggs. Who had a heart attack and wants to make it to the end of the day for his wife and three kids, a baby included.

When these two meet, Roger is reluctant like in the first original picture. And finds out easily Martin has a death wish and a loose cannon. Amid the robbery scenes.

But then we Martin is "welcomed" by his family, more like pushed himself in as for dinner. Roger gets to know Martin and his late wife. As now, Roger goes from being afraid to being sorry for the lonely cop.

Now both will have to put aside their differences and methods to work LA and there is a little twist in the pilot at the end. You will have to see. Won't give it away.

It is a show that has potential. And hope it will grow on in character and in writing. Crawford steals the show away from the more experienced Wayans. But still, both have chemistry.
