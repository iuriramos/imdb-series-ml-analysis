It has been a while since I watched a remake or a new TV show that did not suck big time.

And then Lethal Weapons is on the TV and I decided to give a try. And finally after some time I was pleasantly surprised,

It is the traditional black/white good-by-the-book-and-I-am-too-tired- for-this-stuff cop and the crazy-unconventional-maniacal-bad-cop story. 

Good script, good actors, no indoctrination, no hidden or subliminal agendas. 

Even Damon Wayans is not his usual annoying persona. He plays the straight man in a surprisingly nice way 

If they keep the show like the pilot episode, LW is a keeper.
