I liked this show much better than I thought I would. I am a big fan of the original, and was dubious about television replacements for Murtaugh and Riggs. But Damon Wayans and Clayne Crawford really pulled it off. It wasn't too kitschy, and was sometimes hilarious.

I really didn't expect to see such a brand new addition to the Murtaugh family, especially since Rog is 50 years old. But you can never go wrong with a cute baby. And that one is very cute.

I know that it will probably be a while before a new love interest for Riggs can become part of the cast, but I look forward to that with interest. (I wonder if "Clayne" is a family name.)
