Not a reboot more of a fresh start.. First 5 minutes was little over the top. However put aside the movies and go in with a fresh start. If you like Like your action you will love it. Big budget action with a bit of heart wrenching. Yes please. I have nothing but love for this. Enjoy. I actually just set this up and this is my first review. I have simple done this as the negative review are uncalled for. OK so two cops get forced to work together Martin Riggs the gun slinging bad boy who just lost his wife and kid to a car car. The other played buy good old Damon Wayne's is a safety cop who plays by the rules.. I'm only on episode two but and really enjoying it. Once again this is my first review so go easy on me
