First episode was hard to choke down. It seemed almost scripted straight from the first movie, and it was hard to feel the new actors as Riggs and Murtaugh. With each episode, however, Crawford and Wayans are fitting into the roles. Their gelling together and their dialogue is working. There hasn't been any buddy comedy cop shows in years. Now is the time, and this one could work. All the other actors are a sidebar, and replaceable. Crawford and Wayans were excellent casts and could make this one fun show to watch for years. Another notable cast is the dude that plays the former undercover gang member and the lady that plays Trisha. In a few short episodes, this is now the show I look forward to for a midweek wild and fun ride out of reality. Now that I'm comfortable with the cast, I almost can't wait for Riggs to play precinct jokes on Murtaugh, or for a Joe Pesci type character to enter the series. As much as I like all the great anti-hero TV serials that have aired the past decade, it's nice to have a buddy cop show that can be watched weekly just for the fun of it. Let the mind go free for an hour during our weekly rat race.
