TV show based on the popular 'Lethal Weapon' films in which a slightly unhinged cop is partnered with a veteran detective trying to maintain a low stress level in his life. Lethal Weapon 2016 well the trailer for this show was pretty mediocre but it turns out that the show is actually great the 2 leading men have a pretty good chemistry and although they're not Glover or Gibson they do a pretty good job themselves and there is a lot of action but in my opinion i think that the show won't go for a Season 2 and even if it does it won't last that much for a 3rd one first of all is a reboot of an 80's movie and 2nd of all Fox is pretty known to cancel good shows for example Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles was pretty awesome and yet it got cancelled . The show does have problems tho some of the comedy doesn't work always and it does take things from the original like Riggs jumping from a roof again or even a chase sequence that looks like Lethal Weapon 3 and more references to all 4 of them. I give Lethal Weapon (2016) an 8 out of 10 it's not perfect but it's not bad either.
