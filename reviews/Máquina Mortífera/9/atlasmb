It's been nearly thirty years since the "Lethal Weapon" film paired Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in one of the best buddy cop films of all time. The pilot of this television adaptation follows the story of the original film very closely.

Clayne Crawford plays the Mel Gibson character (Martin Riggs)--a suicidal widower who still grieves for his wife. He's a loner and he uses his lack of fear (of death) as an element of surprise, a lethal weapon. Crawford may not portray Riggs as out of touch with reality, like Gibson, but he is more in touch with his feelings and gives Riggs a moving tenderness.

Damon Wayans plays the Danny Glover role (Roger Murtaugh) as more fragile, but he also brings his comic sensibilities, allowing Murtaugh a wider range of comic expression.

To make this a successful television arc, there needs to be chemistry and story. The chemistry is already there, and it has depth and honesty. Can the writers deliver other story lines that develop the feelings between Murtaugh and Riggs without becoming repetitious? How long can Riggs remain suicidal if he finds meaningful relationships? If he regains his will to live, will the character lose its edge? That remains to be seen.

But the photography, direction, music and cast are in place for a successful run if they can find the emotional balance that this show needs.

Update 10/14/16: after four episodes I am increasing my grade to "9" because the show has maintained level of fun that the film established. The chemistry between the partners is great.
