I'm always hesitant to view remakes of things I've liked in the past, but this one is an 'all thumbs up'. I became familiar with Clayne Crawford in 'Rectify' where he played a sane, but vile, version of Martin Riggs. I was a bit apprehensive about him playing Martin Riggs, the insane version. But it works GREAT!!!! He plays the character wonderfully!! The partnership of Damon and Clayne is an excellent combo. I love this show. It's like a mini movie every Wednesday night. I'm glad to see the number of episodes was increased. Finally!!! Something to watch on hump day Wednesdays that gets your blood pumping and your laughter flowing. I hope there is a season two.
