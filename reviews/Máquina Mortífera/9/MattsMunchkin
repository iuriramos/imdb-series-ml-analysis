I am giving it a 9 because well I am a huge Lethal Weapon fan - love Mel Gibson and Danny Glover so the husband and I decided to give the TV series a shot. The reason for not giving 10 stars is because their choice of music could be better.

The story line is similar to the movie story line, with some tweaked differences. Wayans is pulling Murtaugh off greatly, and Crawford is portraying Riggs just as psychotically as Gibson did. Love the back story, just wish it held more true to the movies plot.

So far we have been full of laughter.

We will definitely give it a shot and see how it progresses.
