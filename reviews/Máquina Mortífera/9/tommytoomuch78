Hello all, I'm 38 and I have a deep love of the lethal weapon movies, when I saw this series was airing I thought their going to struggle to fill them boots but was intrigued enough to have a look. To be honest after the first episode I thought nope what have they done, but I still tuned in for the next and the next and now only six episodes in i'm thoroughly enjoying the series. I'm beginning to love the Murtaugh family (More so than the movies) and it makes a refreshing change from all the slapstick or over analytical cop shows on the telly. If they had dropped the names and let the public make the comparisons they would probably have a hit on their hands. As far as I'm concerned it's a big thumbs up and I hope they carry on and build on the series as I think it has lots of potential "Mel who", "Danny what"?
