No spoilers - but the TV show played like a big Hollywood production. When I discovered McG was directing and producing the show (at the opening credits), my expectations went up considerably. 

I've enjoyed Damon Wayans for a long time, and for whatever reason, this production reminds me a lot of "The Last Boyscout" - a not often mentioned little gem of a movie. 

The camaraderie between the two of them seems real, all the casting choices were amazing. Even "the bad guys" gave a pretty ominous impression. 

I really hope this one goes the distance - and I hope they can keep up the pace - what a RUSH! Fanfrickintastic!
