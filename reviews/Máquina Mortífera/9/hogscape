I was underwhelmed when I watched the trailer; thinking, "Why bother?" So, I wasn't going to until a friend told me to give it a chance.

So glad I did. I've only seen the first two episodes but based on that I can heartily recommend this surprise guilty pleasure. It has the OTT action from the movie which demands complete suspension of disbelief but really scores with the banter between the players - particularly Murtaugh and his wife Trish.

The production standards are top-notch with dialogue and action that is genre-perfect. Originally I thought both leads were miscast but after 10-minutes of episode one I realised they were also spot-on.

This is really a super-hero show. These guys don't have capes but they are indestructible. Riggs gets beaten to a pulp by five or six bikers in episode two with only a black eye to show for it. This isn't Bosch. If you liked the first movie (I loved it but hated all the sequels) and are OK with dropping your brain down a gear to soak up the testosterone; you'll love this too.
