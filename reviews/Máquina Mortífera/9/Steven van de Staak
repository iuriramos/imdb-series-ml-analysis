We've seen some really good series in the past like this, and I was really looking forward to something new. So far the plot is fine, lot's of perspectives to keep it interesting for a (long) while. And, there seems to have happened a lot in the past to dig back to. 

The acting is very convincing and even felt like it was natural for them. That's very important, because the two main characters are like fire and ice. And seeing that with two convincing personalities is just great to watch. 

The action is nice, which is important. But it's not too much, and also not too little. It's exactly fine. 

Humor is really my kind of humor. Lot's of small funny remarks and some nicely unexpected things. 

So far, a really good start of the show. Positively surprised.
