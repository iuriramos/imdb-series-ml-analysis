Simply saying - I'm big fan of original movies. I didn't expected much from TV show. I said - OK, 5 minutes, lets try. And completely surprised how good entertainment producers and actors prepared ... My biggest worries was about Riggs - completely unnecessary - best promising show this year - do not ruin that. Bravo! I know this is just beginning, but if plot will go in this direction it can be a biggest TV show for 2016 (ok, just for me, but still...). Close your eyes, just pretend its not only Mel and Danny can play those roles, give a chance and for sure you will be not disappointed at all... Loading of the humour and action are balanced, acting is perfect, nobody wants to catch "originals" or make a just a copy/paste of the moves, faces or other unnecessary things from cinema version. Seems to me they know about "cult" which they are fighting for and just because dint pretend this is truly original that's why is WORKING on me.
