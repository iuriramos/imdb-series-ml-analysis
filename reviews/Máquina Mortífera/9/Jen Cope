I'm not a fan of Damon Wayans AT ALL and I hesitated to watch this but forged ahead because I'm a huge fan of Clayne Crawford. I see a lot of reviewers who have noted that it isn't as "good" as the original Lethal Weapon and I find that a bit weird because a) it was 30 years ago (and, yes, I saw the original and loved it, then) and b) it followed the original too closely (an oxymoron - how do you tell a story if you don't start at the beginning?) and c) the 'new' characters don't follow the 'old' characters (what is the point of a remake?).

I greatly enjoyed the back to the beginning feel of this show and I look forward to the evolution of these characters that we didn't see over the course of the movies. I ended up quite liking Damon Wayans and found that this stretch was a great place for him to go. Clayne Crawford has always been one of my favorite 'southern' actors - smooth voice, expressive face, gorgeous accent. I forgive the bj direction that other reviewers complained about due to, what I assume, the writers wish to engage younger viewers and their less 'delicate sensibilities'.

If you've never seen the original that everyone is banging on about - watch this. If you have seen the original - don't be so judgemental and watch it anyways.
