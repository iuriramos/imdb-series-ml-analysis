If you have loved the first movie, you will definitely love this series. If you haven't, you won't like the series either.

I really like the movies and series is totally in the spirit of the first movie and this is good.

Damon Wayans is very good joke deliverer and Clayne Crawford is smashing them perfectly right in our faces.

The action is cool, the quotes are funny and the actors suit their characters.

Everything was done wright here.

Watch it and have fun!
