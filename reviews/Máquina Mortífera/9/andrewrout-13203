I thought "how can they make this"

I was surprised, thoroughly enjoyed it. Hope they lose the suicidal bit like the films did.

Could get a bit silly like the constant bickering in Hawaii five 0. Good series so far seems to be a good partnership.

I look forward to it every week.

Wasn't sure about the new Riggs but he is growing on me.

Just wish he would get a haircut.

As long as they stay away from the old stories things will be fine. nothing like a good action series.

hope we get series 2.
