I watched the first episode fully prepared to be disappointed, but wow, these guys really pulled it off! I actually think if it continues to be this good, I will like this better than the original movies. It's that good. And, I am not your "typical" action-cop watcher...just an old lady who would never like this series just for the guts and glory. The chemistry between the characters was evident from the get-go...and I mean all the characters not just the 2 leading men. The writing is really good and solid. If the rest of the episodes just remain on par with the first one, it will be a good show. If they get better and better, it will be a GREAT series. Here's hoping!
