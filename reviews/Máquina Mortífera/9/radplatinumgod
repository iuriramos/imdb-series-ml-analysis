Lethal Weapon, all of the movies, to this day, is my favorite movie series. I adore every character and every bit of the story line. The TV series... I love Damon Wayans and believe he is worthy of the role as Roger. I am not very familiar with Clayne Crawford. I don't like his hair at all lol... but aside from that, he is believable and likable in the role of Martin. The witty banter is there to a small degree, but I believe that will improve as they become more comfortable with their characters. One thing I did not like was the change of Vickie to whatever hispanic background they gave to Martin's wife. Why the change? I am sure diversity has something to do with it. /sigh Hollywood, QUIT CHANGING THINGS FOR THE SAKE OF DIVERSITY!!! If you want more ethnic characters, CREATE NEW ONES and stop changing established characters. I am honestly surprised they didn't try to make Martin into Martina or some such. Anyway, the show has lots of action and the bond seems to be forming nicely between Riggs and the Murtaugh clan... though they seem to be leaving the sub plot of Roger's daughter having a crush on Riggs. We will see. I am hoping Leo makes an appearance at some point. Keep up the good work and give this show a chance. This is the first review I have ever written because I love this franchise so much, I was inspired. Thanks for the ride.
