I grew up with the movies, and consider them classics, so this show had a lot to live up to. I must say that I was surprised how good it turned out to be. Similar story lines as the movie, but different enough to be a fresh take on it. I figured it would be like most shows these days, and be completely cheesy, with a lot of one liners. Turned out to be funny, but not cheesy. Actually had some substance, and real feeling to it. Think all the actors did a good job too. If you are on the fence, a fan of the movies, just give it a shot, don't think you will be disappointed. I should note, that it only has one episode so far, and I basing off of what I've seen so far.
