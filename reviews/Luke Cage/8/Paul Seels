I read earlier that this is another success between Netflix and Marvel again, for me its yet another Netflix success for me. With the likes of Narcos etc being made just for Netflix the internet Networks power continues to grow in the entertainment wars. 

The show itself is brilliant for me, perfect choice of actors some who I've seen before as early as Oz in the 90's and some new ones who i've never seen before. I love the slow build of the story but each episode having major action and character growing sidelines in each, no simple characters here you travel through the layers in each episode growing to like or loath each as you go. 

it's a great commentary on how fickle the general public can be when it comes to "have a go heroes" and forcing the limelight on people who perhaps just don't want it. And perhaps casts a light on Harlem itself in parts! 

Once you start the series it's very hard to stop, and i mean very hard! I started yesterday now less than a full 24 hours later I'm pretty close to the end of the season if not at the very end now (ep 13) and am already pandering for another series. For me this more true to life comic book drama suits me more than the likes for DD, I enjoyed Jessica Jones but the action in Luke Cage coupled by the tons of attractive actresses for me just made it compulsive viewing. I just couldn't wait to see what the latest twist was in the saga and eagerly anticipate the next series!
