Reading some of the negative reviews for this show makes me quite sad. Reading between the lines it seems to me that far too many people these days can't cope with character and drama and just want thrills and action. The shows that stand the test of time though have more than that and so far all of Marvel's Netflix shows have managed to combine all of these things and for me delivered the things needed to send these shows onto the classics list of the future. The entire cast of Luke Cage was terrific and whoever the casting director was for it needs to put in for a pay raise. The script was good but due to the slight slow down after a major death in the middle of the series does not quite make it to greatness. Politically some of the script was a bit on the nose but personally I found it quite emotional especially as apparently the Hoodie that Cage first gets shot in was deliberately chosen to be the same as Trayvon Martin wore when he was shot and other such nods to black life in America for far too many. The soundtrack and musical performances were very good too.
