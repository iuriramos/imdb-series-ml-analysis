Luke Cage does fall short of Daredevil's achievements mainly because it repeats a lot of the stuff that the latter's already done: backstories regarding the main character, the villain being in the center of a conflict between his people and competing criminals, and of course elements of corruption in the police force bending the story in the villain's favor.

The title character is essentially a bullet-proof-skinned Captain America living in Harlem, New York instead of Brooklyn. Is this a bad thing? No. Does the origin story of Luke's powers take a little too much from Captain America: The First Avenger? Yes; but it does change the circumstance, in that Luke was going to be healed rather than voluntarily be 'upgraded' the way Steve was. Luke Cage makes it clear that Marvel wants to be more experimental with their TV shows than with their movies: this show is a neo-blaxploitation show that makes various throwbacks to African-American history and social commentary.

Luke Cage is entertaining, though it can be derivative of the previous Marvel shows before it. At least it uses familiar territory to build a new and compelling character.
