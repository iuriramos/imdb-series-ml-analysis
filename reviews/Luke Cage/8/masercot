This show was nearly flawless. Excellent acting, good music and a very nice pace. In one episode, they set everything in motion without it seeming forced. And, Luke Cage has the charisma that Daredevil doesn't.

The lonely superhero persona kind of gets on my nerves after a while and this doesn't really deviate from that. I'm hoping he settles down with what seems to be his destined love-interest. Which brings me to my only gripe:

I'm no prude, but the only flaw I find is with the soft-core sex scenes in this an in his cameo in the other series, complete with funky bass. Whereas it is nice to see he is getting his share of sex, it seems a little out of place in a superhero show.

That being said, I am looking very much forward to the rest of the series...
