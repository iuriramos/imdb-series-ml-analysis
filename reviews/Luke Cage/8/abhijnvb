After the undeniable glory of Daredevil and the gritty experience of Jessica Jones , Luke Cage had a lot to catch up to. It may not be as deep as DD or as nonchalantly beautiful as JJ but Luke Cage has its charm.

The gangster style( more The Wire than The Godfather) universe puts Luke Page apart form its other peers. The same style of cinematography, witty dialogues makes Luke Cage wonderful. For me, who hasn't read the comics, Luke Cage offered a hero who was down to earth , human and unique. More screen time for Claire Temple was something well deserved. 

The show may not gauge up to the high standards of the Daredevil, is a good show nonetheless.
