I have a dim view of comic book TV shows and I was completely underwhelmed by Jessica Jones. Ten episodes of her chasing this guy bored me to death. The only character who I found interesting was the neighbor girl who lived with her brother. You never knew quite what she was going to do. So, even though I LOVE Marvel movies, I had low expectations for Luke Cage.

Turns out, it was a robust crime drama with several plot lines. I liked how it was similar to New York Undercover with the nightclub setting and the famous acts. And while it IS a show that reminds you of something you've seen in the past, Colter makes up for that with his southern-man-in-NY thing. As a native NY'er, its obvious to me that he's NOT NY guy. That's character depth.

I liked how it showed people of color in all walks of life. The show is funny at times; you have to be immersed in a certain culture to get some of the jokes. I suspect this was what people who didn't like the show hated the most. Jokes about black sororities or listening to the Delfonics is lost on what would be the broader target audience for this show. The language might also put people off. 

But hey, I applaud them for putting something unique and authentic out there. There's enough happening in this show that it really is a good time.
