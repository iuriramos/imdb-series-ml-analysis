The Marvel Universe continues to expand with its newest addition to The Defenders and the Netflix series in Luke Cage. Mike Colter plays the titular role of Power Man, a nearly indestructible hero with a troubled past and a streak of vengeance. Cage is the first black hero to lead a Marvel property on film and the show revels in the new territory with a hopping soundtrack, iconic cultural references, and the current events of failed American justice. The shows creator Cheo Hodari Coker brings a unique vision to the superhero while including references to the comic and still adapting to the modern setting of Harlem. The show sets its own pace through 13 episodes, which feels like a lot but left me wanting more.

Colter is great as the brooding lead villain and delivers both the new dialogue and catchphrases with his deep voice and certain seriousness not always common in comic book adaptations. He's back up by a stellar supporting cast including Simone Missick as Detective Misty Knight who investigates the murders that surround Luke Cage. He's also assisted by the one character who appears in all the Marvel and Netflix properties, the Night Nurse Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson). Two other minor characters that stood out were barbershop owner Pop (Frankie Faison) and frequent customer Bobby Fish (Ron Cephas Jones).
