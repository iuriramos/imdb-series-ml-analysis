Firstly, before i begin this review let me say this; 'DO NOT' watch Luke Cage if you are looking for a Daredevil or Jessica Jones fix because its a very different feel. Luke cage is very unique in its own way, and all the negative criticism arise from people comparing it to the above mentioned. This show tells the story of a humble man, who just happens to have some powers trying to survive and live a low key life in Harlem, however some trouble arises and he has to step up to be a local hero. The show uniquely tackles topics such as political/police corruption and crime in black communities. The dialogue and one liners in the scripts is heavily influenced by black culture, black history, sports references and pop culture. And don't get me started on the music, the hip hop, funk, and soul music blends perfectly with the feel of the show. I highly recommend this show, if you enjoy Samuel L Jackson style dialogue, one liner jokes, crime and some action. That said I'm gonna go get some coffee!!!!
