I have seen some negative reviews but I loved this series. It is the story of nature versus nurture for the main villain and a struggle for direction for Luke. I love the understated approach , just like DareDevil and Jessica Jones and the realistic feel for everything from the wardrobe to the sets. The Easter eggs were very amusing with Luke donning the 70s type costume and then Misty's problem with her arm-would she lose it?

The pain of Misty is all to evident and the struggle against 'the system' is real as are the references to modern policing in the US. Her struggle with her feelings for Luke and 'not deserving' happiness made an interesting side bar to the main story and boy was she hot when they got it on ! The series finale had a bit too much of Diamondback for my liking but he was a truly chilling character ; nothing on Mariah though, and the final scene was fine symmetry with me wanting to know whats next for Misty. All of this coupled with a soundtrack that I purchased almost immediately and cameos galore . A bold vision for Luke Cage with nods to the era he was conceived in but with nods to the present. Great !
