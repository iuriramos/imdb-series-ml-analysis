Luke Cage is the second black superhero to be in a series or movie of his own after the Blade series (if you exclude the Black Panther animated mini-series of 2010).But let's be honest the Marvel Universe made the series in order to diversify even more and surely the final product is quit good no question about it. 

But firstly I will be the devil's advocate for a while to high light the draw- backs of the series. One and by far the most important is the plot , is slow and many events take place that are just fillers to make the series last 13 episodes. Second, the villain Diamondback is a little too spychotic for me and in all honest not as interesting as Cottonmouth (Mr. Danton it seems you should stop working with politicians, for it never ends well with you). Thirdly and this is my personal issue, if you don't have any issue with it then fine, I didn't like very much many of the songs in it. To any music experts or who like it ,I am sorry it just didn't appeal to me, but over all this more a minor problem for me, as person and not with the series as a whole.

To the good stuff, Mike Colter does a fantastic job portrait Power Man (Luke Cage). He is calm, stoic and very nice guy to be with, add to that he is pretty much bullet proof and ladies and gentle man ,the third Defender is great! And the rest of the cast are memorable and I want to see more of them in the future. An other well made part is how much the appearance of Luke change the environment in Harlem, an area which had its fair share of unrest and now with super-powered person roaming the streets you bet is going to be some changes. It is like putting a shark to an aquarium. Fourthly is the jokes, are almost perfectly timed and fit the situation, in which their in very well.

Wow side note here Quentin Tarantino said that he is a big fan of Luke Cage,so there is that.

Overall is a good tribute to the black culture and I recommended ,even if it is a great of the previous two entries.
