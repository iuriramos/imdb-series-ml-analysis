loved this show i cant think of anything bad to say about this show other than the overuse of the n word.The guy is a really good actor and so are the cops and most of the other people on the show.I really enjoyed this I watched this in about 3 weeks only prolonged due to work please watch Luke cage if u like action or super hero movies with a little dark cop twist to it.You wont be disappointed give this flick a shot.It was rated an eight when i got here and i don't see any reason as to why its not an eight about that it is a total eight not a ten like stranger things but a solid eight for sure.Now i think ill watch daredevil thanks.
