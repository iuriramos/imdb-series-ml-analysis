Had a feeling that Luke Cage would get his own show, after his impressive appearance in Jessica Jones. I really liked the way the show tries to be very gritty and real, and not presented in a comic book style like you see in others based on a comic book. Feels like a real gangster show with a superhero mixed in.

Mike Colter plays Luke Colter very well, not just has an awesome bad ass, but has someone who has to come to terms with his abilities. Seeing him in the role, it's like the character just walked off the comic book. Simone Missick is pretty good has Misty Knight, I'm really looking forward to what there gonna do with her character in future projects. Alfre Woodard is great too, you're just not sure to love her or to hate her. I hope this francise will cease to amaze me.
