This is a very fun series. In fact it's now my favorite. That said it does start off too slowly but nearing the end of episode three it picks up pace and episode four takes off and the series never looks back. Also be aware the show is as much about the community Harlem as it is Luke Cage. This is not a standard superhero show. While there's certainly is a lot of action, it's very much character-driven with many people and the community itself transforming for better and worse. One last point that is worth mentioning is there are a lot of women in this series. Not eye-candy or objects but simply important roles that happen to be women. Misty Knights second commanding officer is a woman. And the one before that was also female! Not that this is a feminist show but it does show woman that are smart and strong and that's is not a bad thing. Again a very good time to be had here.
