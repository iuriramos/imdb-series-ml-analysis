This is my first ever review, even though I've been visiting the IMDb site for years. I've only watched the first two episodes and am looking forward to seeing more. We are Marvel fans in our house, which made me check this out. I tried watching Daredevil but it didn't get my attention. I haven't watched Jessica Jones, so the character of Luke Cage is new to me. Having seen this though I am interested to check out Jessica Jones. 

As a regular on IMDb, I find the user reviews helpful and interesting, but often, especially when it comes to Marvel, I find so many poor reviews for unrealistic reasons and it's irritating. These shows and movies are based on comic book characters. It's not the real world. I think most of the actors do a great job, some are stand outs. I'm not sure what some viewers want from a TV show or a movie these days. Myself, I like a decent story line, good acting, great sets and a bit of eye candy definitely helps! I'm there to lose myself for an hour or so and just enjoy a fantasy world. It's not a documentary up for an Oscar. It's entertainment and a bit of an escape. It's annoying to me that people can't lighten up and enjoy something good for what it is. 

This show is worth the watch. It ticks all of the boxes for me. Hoping I still think the same after I watch the all of the episodes and it doesn't end up like Gotham did for me. But that's another review! 9/10
