I absolutely loved this movie, from the acting to the setting to the overall tone. I loved Colters acting, and I loved Mahershala as Cottonmouth. I've seen a lot of hate for this show, and I honestly can't see why, besides the Diamondback motivation thing. I will admit he was annoying after a while, but the show made up for it. I've also seen people complain about Luke not being 'exciting' or the show not having enough 'risk' to it. I personally love that this show doesn't do the whole 'if you mess up the whole world is dead' thing. I love that Luke wants to fix Harlem and get revenge on Cottonmouth and eventually Diamondback. SPOILER: Also I love how Mariah kills Cottonmouth instead of Luke or someone else. It creates a huge plot twist and I love Lukes reaction when he finds out that he's already dead. Overall, I absolutely love this show, and I think if Season 2 (if its made) improves on the slight mess-ups of the first Season, it could be one of the greatest shows ever made.
