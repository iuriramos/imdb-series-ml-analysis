Great

Another great series by Netflix with a Marvel Comic portrayal.

The only negative thing I can say is, Lot of Luke Cage fighting scenes are obstructed with the on stage singers and dancing.

The music is over the top and it's hard to get into the brief fighting scenes.

They should focus on the fighting scenes like they do in Dare Devil.

Understand trying something new but this was a fail for me.

Other than that, great series looking forward to Iron Fist.

Also the Defenders.
