This is a high quality production with brilliant performances that can be easily watched in a binge watching fashion. It plays as most mini-series do with a serial plot that continues for the 13 episode run.There is more than comic book violence and it is not for younger audiences.Character development is particularly good here with Theo Rossi's portrayal of " shades" a standout performance.His look, voice and delivery reminds me of Gene Kelly if he had ever portrayed a villain.If his character is written out cast this guy in a remake of singing in the rain. It will be interesting to see if a second season goes ahead.
