I've been binge watching Luke Cage and I'm up to episode 6. It's historic in that it's the first black superhero series that Marvel has put up. Mike Coulter is superb in the charismatic lead, but there are plenty of other very good actors in the cast, including the ones in the bit parts. The action scenes leave nothing to be desired: they are superb. 

I read one review that said it was simply a blaxploitation film, but frankly, I just don't see it that way. I see it as a fairly typical good guys versus bad guys (superhero vs.villain) scenario, but in a Harlem setting. It's not a "real" Harlem any more than Gotham is a "real" Manhattan, but there are uniquely Harlem elements nevertheless. It seems to me, standing outside the culture, that the dialog is fairly accurate. I can find no disrespect to the black culture being portrayed.

In fact, one of the most interesting aspects of the series is that a *lot* of names get dropped about whom I know nothing: sportsmen, social reformers, educators, entertainers and so on. Looking up each one has been something of an education. Oh, and the sound track is outstanding.
