How on earth this show got an 8.2 review is beyond me. Cast mostly OK, although the acting was awful. Script was terrible.... I think if you watch it, you'll soon realize that I was right and you'll know who the bad actors are too. OK, I'm not too interested in Oscar winning performances, but it was bad... After watching the entirety of the first 6 episodes (painfully) I then had to skip through some scenes just to find some juicy fight scenes. I couldn't find anything. I would like to meet the critics that gave this a high rating, because they've either got paid to give a good rating or they need to be fired. 

This is NOT worth watching....

With all of the great TV shows out there, Designated Survivor being one of them, please, please, please stop with this cr4p!!!
