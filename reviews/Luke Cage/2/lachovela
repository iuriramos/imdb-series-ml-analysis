I watched Daredevil and Jessica Jones, both are amazing shows. I waited for Luke Cage for a long time, but now I can say it was disappointing...

If you watch Luke Cage, you can see that the director did a great job, since you can see that the photography, story cuts and style are original and good to see. Also the supporting actors and Main actor did an amazing job... 

Everything is good, except for one little detail: The Story. 

It is very predictable, slow and it has no good villain that can fight against Luck. The last 3 episodes of the series are the "best", but even though I can say I was watching my cel while I was watching those ... 

I recommend to watch this , though, since I am sure there will be some reference points from this show in future Marvel series , but not as a high priority...
