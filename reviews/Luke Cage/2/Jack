After falling in love with Jessica Jones, I, too, was eager to tune into Luke Cage. I very much enjoyed his character's slow development in JJ. However, after watching 4 or 5 episodes (I made every effort to give it a chance to turn into something worth viewing) I was not engaged whatsoever. It was a chore to get to the end of each episode. The action scenes (very few at that) are anti-climactic and the extensive, sometimes monotonous dialogue just seems forced and meaningless. Alfre Woodard's acting and overall interpretation of Mariah Dillard comes across as completely out of place with an already contrived plot. Although Mike Colter is great to look at, his portrayal of the misunderstood super hero lacks overall appeal and invokes no emotion. I stopped watching. I eagerly anticipate the second season of JJ.
