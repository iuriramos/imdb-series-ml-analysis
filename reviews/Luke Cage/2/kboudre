I started Luke Cage with high expectations, because so far Marvel Movies and shows have been good. What I found was a show that had bad acting and a plot that shows the writers were not sure which way they wanted to go.

The meeting between the main characters fell flat.

Also in episode 10 when the boys mom refereed to the black cops and said "If your blue your white" I felt that comment was not needed and offensive. There was no reason for it, and did not benefit the show in one bit other than to be an offensive comment. In one sentence this show managed to offend cops and white people.

This will be the last time I watch this show since it seems to more about offending cops and white people than about entertaining all people.
