This show is beyond bad. I am six episodes in. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!! The pace not only doesn't pick up, it gets worse. Netflix will be the single biggest cause of the fall of The Marvel franchise. Now on to the show..... Did I say terrible? there is almost no action. No good acting. Stereotypes galore. Use of the "N" word for no reason. Terrible soundtrack. Terrible sound effects and background (noise) music. I dunno; if you ask me this show is a product of a horribly written script and directed by someone that did not allow the actors to ad-lib, which negates them getting into character. Even the main character of the show is pretty much an emotionless disaster. I get that he's supposed to be dismal, fighting the proverbial demons that are forcing his hand, but c'mon with the cheesy one-liners that spew out every time a bullet bounces off him. Under the right leadership this could have been a great show. However this is truly Bad. The only reason they don't get one star is because it's not animated. Then there's the storyline. Almost impossible to follow. Some powerful lady runs Harlem and has this power hungry guy who works for someone else hire people to do his dirty work. Ugg. Trust me, life is too short and sweet to be wasting your life on this hot mess. You probably won't listen, but you'll wish you had.
