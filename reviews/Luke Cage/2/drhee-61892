The only thing super about Luke Cage, in this show, is his ability to outlast the ineptitude of the Harlem Police Department. If I wanted to watch something about social injustice I'd turn on the news and catch up on the thousand different BLM protests. The only cool thing about this show may have been Method Man's surprise appearance. Come on Marvel. Just because he's a black super hero doesn't mean you have to tie these modern social issues to the show. I wont even mention the acting of Mike Colter, the over-snarling antagonist DiamondBack, the BET soap opera like drama... smh. I awarded this show 2 stars for Method man and some of the first action sequences... after those initial scenes the action got really dry and repetitive. Just awful.
