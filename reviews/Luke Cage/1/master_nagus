I wanted to like this, I really did, watched the first 20 minutes, did not see a single person of any other race except black, this is not representative of America, in this country lives people of ALL races. Turned it off will not be giving another go. We live in an age of racial double standards, if a movie is made with an all white cast, they are insulted and attacked, demanding that there be some racial diversity, you have blacks in shows and movie that depict ancient Britain and other euro nations at a time when blacks did not exist there, for no reason other than to quiet the violent black mobs. It is not my intention to spread,justify or glorify the hate in this country, but turnabout is fair play. If it isn't racially diverse i won't watch it.
