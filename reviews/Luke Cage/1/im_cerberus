Now, I'd never heard of Luke Cage before, until I began watching Dare Devil and people began talking of Luke. Fine, I thought, I love Dare Devil and I bet Luke Cage is going to be good.

Wrong.

I'm getting tired of these angst ridden super heroes moping around, acting as third rate private investigators, barber shop workers and so on. Luke Cage is a bore fest. It's really boring. Very very boring.

The backstory is boring, the mentor is boring, Cottonmouth, the villain in the beginning, is just... there's nothing interesting. The black guys mouthing off ghetto words just sounds artificial and so out of place (see Wire to see how it's done right).

I get it, the guy is tortured by his past and all that, but I don't think this super hero's intention is to bore someone to submission. Marvel needs to get off this tortoise paced train and get back to finishing Punisher.

I tried watching it with the TV running in the background while I did other things, but man - I still couldn't finish it.
