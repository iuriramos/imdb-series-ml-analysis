I Strongly Advise you to stay away from this show. it was nothing near the daredevil and i didn't think it was possible but it was far worse than Jessica Jones. the whole idea of this show was stupid. Luke Cage is the man of steel with IQ of a plant. acting is terrible. cast weren't at starring scale. the ending was like a straight insult to viewer's time and logic. the only tolerable thing in this stupid show was the soundtrack. i wish netflix concentrate on stranger shows like better things. if you ask me why i continue and watched ep after ep it was because that i hate to unfinish a film or TV show don't you waste your time like i did. there are a lot of good shows that deserve to be seen.
