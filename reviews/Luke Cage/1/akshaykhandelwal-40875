This was probably the worst piece of s*** i've seen by marvel and Netflix. writing comment also seems a waste. it is terrible. i cant even put it to words how bad it is. what was the budget for this one? $550? acting: weak plot: weaker action: loll what? characters: unnecessary and stupid story-line: slower than the slowest thing i have seen in my life. 13 hours of boredom. What i cannot understand is do they not see what they are making as they are making? or is it just that they want the series to get them (netflix) more subscription so in the rush to create content they ignore everything else?

GET YOUR ISH TOGETHER. THIS Isn't WHAT WE EXPECT TODAY'S DAY AND AGE. ITS THE 21ST CENTURY FOR CRYING OUT LOUD
