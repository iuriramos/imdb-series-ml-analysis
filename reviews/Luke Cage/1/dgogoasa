... like there are some actors brought to the night show. Look at them they are real they are talking but have nothing to say. I made it all the way to episode 4 . . . but that is enough. AWFUL... a super-dude (you know Marvel..) who decides to make some order in Harlem... BUT HE DOESN'T touch the head of the bad guys because the series would have 1 episode. Therefore they all talk and move slowly... How long does it take to walk 10 meters in real life? I don't know but it takes the same in this movie . . .

Don't waste your time with this... I DID.

BUT the review will not be accepted unless it has at least 10 lines of text. But really besides awful I don't know what else to say.. the actors are good but with the lines they have . . . what can thy do?
