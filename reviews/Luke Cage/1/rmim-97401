Unfortunately Luke Cage shows that not every Marvel Netflix series is great. Admittedly Daredevil and Jessica Jones set the bar very high so I went into this show with high hopes.

The pacing is so slow and filled with tediously bad dialogue that 75% of the show could be cut and it would have lead to a far more enjoyable miniseries. There also appears to be far too many flash backs that detract from the flow of the story.

Additionally, Luke Cage doesn't feel anything like the character that was introduced in Jessica Jones which is a shame, as that character was interesting.
