Luke Cage is a TV show just for SJWs, liberals and plebes.

Unfortunately, the show ignores its own tactics at diversity, and does not feature many white characters. This show is not 'diverse' if there is just one particular race.

This show is extremely limited in its cast.

Not to mention, the plot is poor, the action is terrible, and the pacing is truly some of the worst pacing in TV history.

Seriously, it moves like a snail and it turns the show into a complete snoozefest.

Dodge a bullet and ignore this tripe DC show! More 'superhero' garbage that lacks substance and quality.

Do not watch.

1/10. Would not recommend.
