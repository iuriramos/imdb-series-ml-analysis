He's a well-read, proud, and blacker than midnight hero, a god-like man who drops bits and pieces of black history and historical black icons to small time hoods just before kicking their asses. Unfortunately, that's where his love and passion for blackness ends. Like the over-whelming majority of black male leads, he too for some strange phenomenon can't seem to develop a healthy romantic relationship with a woman who shares his physical attributes. The black women in Luke Cage's world play many diverse roles: victim, perpetrator, a working single mother, and detective, but not one has been capable of having a romantic relationship with this fine hero. No, you see that role is exclusively reserved for a non-black woman. In Luke's case, Rosario Dawson, who was "too pretty to ever apologize for anything,"according to Luke's side kick.

Rosario Dawson, a mixed race Latino actress, who could restore Daredevil to good health, but she wasn't permitted to have a romantic relationship with the blind white knight because that role was set aside for two white women. 

In contrast, Black male heroes seem to consistently overlook any potential black love interests, as Luke did in three instances, and find their way to the arms of women who don't share their race, history, or culture. In the very first scene, a very attractive dark skin black woman (single mother), who adorned short hair, tried to lure him for a drink of coffee but was swiftly rejected, not once but twice.

Luke Cage may represent black men, but for black women he is no hero.
