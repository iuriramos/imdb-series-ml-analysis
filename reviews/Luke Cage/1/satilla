Acting, cgi , directing, script....all are terrible. it is very racist and low quality. Who wrote the script? Did he/she even read it? Do not waste your precious time on this one. 

Also even though this series seems to be made for black people , whom are in reality oppressed , in this series it makes it look like black people are the one oppressing the other minorities. In this series all black people are one way or another has a criminal history, all look like they are going to shoot someone or rob someone. 

Anyway this series is racist in every way , no white person in the casting, everyone is black except 2 Asians with an insignificant role ( also they made it look like Asians are stingy and weak ( for example the land lord... ) ). We all believe all races should be proud of themselves but as i said all ( white , black , Asian...etc) not only the blacks. if you change the color of the people in this series then all black people will be on the street shouting against discrimination. 

This series don't even deserve a comment.
