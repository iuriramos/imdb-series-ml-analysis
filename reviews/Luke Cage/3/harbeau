I have restarted this review about five times now, because it usually devolves into a rant about Hollywood and the crap they feed us now. I'll try to avoid that..mostly. :) Just the basics. 

This show is a tired repeat of many of the shows out there right now, just with cosmetic changes. (black skin instead of white, Harlem instead of Metropolis, etc.) The same slow, na√Øve handsome man who believes that everything will be OK, regardless of how deep the @#$^ is, usually his own fault.

And when I say slow, I mean that many ways. He is always behind the ball mentally, trying to catch up (and never succeeding.) And he also is just plain slow, likening him not to a speeding bullet but a leisurely cement truck.

And a bullet magnet! Bullets can't seem to miss him, but that's rather a good thing, as he isn't very careful about how he carries anyone in his hands at the time. (You can see the people he's 'protecting' clearly, even when someone is shooting a machine gun at him) 

All in all, if you are bored it is mindless entertainment. If you want anything more, you will be woefully disappointed.
