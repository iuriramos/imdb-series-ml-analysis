I wanted to like this show. I thought his appearances in Jessica Jones were fantastic. But this, far and away, is the worst of the Marvel Netflix shows, and I wasn't a huge fan of Jessica Jones either.

There are two reasons I couldn't get through this season (I watched the first 5 episodes):

1. The "n-word" was used prolifically. I know the writers tried to use it in the same way that African-Americans use it in conversation today, but its use was way over the top in my opinion. It got to the point it was detracting from the terrible writing of the rest of the episodes.

2. The bigger problem is that the writing is terrible and the story progression is horrendous. What I watched of the season (again, 5 episodes) could have been boiled down to 2-3 episodes. One of the episodes I saw was completely and utterly useless. It did exactly nothing but explain Luke's backstory, which could have been handled much cleaner and easier in a 15 min clip, rather than the way it was done. Besides that, you've got a guy who is bulletproof and super strong, and he knows it. Why doesn't he just go take out the villain in episode 2? The answer is I have no idea! It would have made perfect sense for Cage to have done it. But he doesn't.

Don't waste your time with this one unless you want to relive your blaxploitation days of the 70s. That's all it's good for.
