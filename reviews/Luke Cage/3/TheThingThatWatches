After the success of Netflix's other Marvel shows, this series was a disappointment. The dialogue was reminiscent of those shallow melodramatic network crime dramas intended for the elderly who need simple exposition like Law & Order. I felt embarrassed for all these talented actors having to repeat such schlock.

Each character's convenient stupidity and irrational actions are too numerous to list, but the series suffered most from the lack of a worthy adversary. The soap-opera motivations of the prime villain and his plot device to negate Luke's powers were inexcusably unimaginative. A hero who will always win a physical fight requires a villain that provides a challenge brute force alone can't beat. This show was missing that vital element, and in it's place was a lazy kryptonite proxy.

I surmise the problems with this story will be overshadowed by predictable babbling about the black-ness of the theme and cast, but that factor should not make this unsurprising string of tropes invulnerable to the criticism it deserves.
