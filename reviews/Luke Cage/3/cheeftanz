I came on here after waiting breathlessly for this series and the hope that it hits hard. Yet in every way our hero could fix (as all the other commenters have also noted) the city's 'Cottonmouth problem" in a few episodes... turns out everybody is feckless. The hero hapless, the villain moronic, the henchmen hilariously incompetent.

I stuck with it for four boring hours. The last hour I started fast forwarding ... something that for most HBO productions these days would be almost unthinkable. Netflix has House of Cards and a few others that are 100% riveting and binge-worthy. If forced to watch another hour of LC I would need to be unspeakably high, drunk or both. If the hyper-mediocre craftings of Cheo Hodari Coker were to continue on with 'Luke Cage'- the series it will collapse on itself by the end of the year. 

I was actually hoping for a moment while watching the end of the fourth episode that Luke would be mercifully killed sooner than later, then I finally realized this show was a pos.
