I decided to try this as netflix kept jamming it in my face so why not. To start of this is not family friendly it is another made for netflix flick so like a bad cable channel. Cant say I recognize any of the characters or actors not one. I found this show offensive, poorly acted, bad effects. Seems like its just me I see these flaky shows popping up with nobody in them and no real story. Guess I'm just not as bored as others I wont sit through this kind of stuff. So glad they dropped decent shows made by professionals to make there own.. Bottom line its just my opinion I always put quality above hype and popular culture.
