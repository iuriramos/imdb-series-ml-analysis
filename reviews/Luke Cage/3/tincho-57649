Not quite on the HYPE TRAIN I love comics but with this adaptation of Luke Cage I'm not a fan of. There is a lot of story but is kind of boring the dialogues are not well written and is hard to engage with the plot. The sound editor is lame. Love the music tough. But it feels like they put so much attention on the music of the club, instead of putting better action scenes or dialogues that keeps you interested. All the actors perform quite well and if you liked Jessica Jones probably you'll find Luke Cage interesting. In Luke Cage you'll find a TV show that will not hook you up. You end up seeing the whole show because you already spend some hours viewing the firsts episodes I hope the Defenders change the pace of the story telling.
