This show started out good and I thought there was potential before the first episode had an unusually long sex scene that would be uncomfortable to watch around family. Unfortunately every episode got worse and worse as the season went on and I started to notice a common theme in this movie which is that all black people are criminals. The cast is mostly black and all of them are current or past criminals. There are no white people in the cast and I had to double check to see if it was made by Tyler Perry. This would be a better series if Terry Crews was the main role. Nobody in this show stands out as a good actor. I think they picked the cast based on their appearance instead of their acting ability. The dialogue is dry and I find myself skipping ahead in episodes only to find them in the same set with nothing new. The main superhero has super strength but appears to be on the autistic spectrum so its mostly useless. I think this show is pandering to African American viewers and is sending the wrong message. There was a scene where a night club is shot up and I found it distasteful because it immediately reminded me of the gay night club shooting in Orlando. I'm sure there will be a season 2 because Disney is going to milk this for all they can.
