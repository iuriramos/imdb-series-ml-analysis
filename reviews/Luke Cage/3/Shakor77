I watched the first episode and I don't know what this is supposed to be, because Luke Cage is a superhero and this is not a superhero series.

In the 50+ minutes of the first episode, there was 2-3 minutes of actual super-hero action. The rest was gangsters, violence, sex and a whooooole lot of talking.

The main lead was convincing enough and there was some good actors in there but as a whole it was uninteresting and boring. No idea why they even bothered with Luke Cage. Could have been just some random dude instead because as I said, 2-3 minutes of super-hero action. That's it. Boo.
