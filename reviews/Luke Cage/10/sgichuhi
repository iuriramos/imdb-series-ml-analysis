First of all don't go in excepting something like Thor,grow up.Daredevil and Jessica Jones already established they are willing to go places the Marvel movies dare not go.They got that quality storytelling and intrigue like Game Of Thrones. but more accurately with Luke Cage.I'll compare it to the greatest show ever made.. The Wire.

Luke Cage takes you to the heart and soul of Harlem and music.Everything is top notch from the acting to the characters to the action. The dialogue sounds straight out of a Quentin Tarantino movie with them discussing whose better between Bruce Lee and Jet Li & Many other pop culture reference.There is some social and political commentary too.This show better get all the Emmy awards that can be thrown at it. What I like about the Marvel Netflix shows is how each one feels different from the rest.The theme of hope makes Luke Cage stand out.Did I also mention this is the most diverse show on television,Asians Whites,Latinas & Of course blacks.

Now I love most Netflix shows especially the creme like House Of Cards,Narcos,Daredevil,Master Of None,Jessica Jones, Stranger Things etc but as far as first seasons go Luke Cage is the Gold Standard.
