As a fan of old school hip-hop, the music Easter eggs and cameos made the show a great pleasure to watch. The first thing I noticed when I saw the episode names was that they were all named after songs by Gang Starr. This got me hooked even before watching. I am not just basing this review on personal bias toward the music, but on the story told. This show takes place in an area that Daredevil and Jessica Jones have never been to; Harlem. With this new area comes new criminals and villains introduced into the MCU. There are many character with different backgrounds and stories that give the show an insight into the mind state of the people. Marvel, once again, has made a show with a great story, characters, and and overall get viewers hooked and satisfied. If you consider yourself a fan of the MCU, this is a must-watch. Hopefully this review was helpful and if you are planning on watch the show, hopefully you enjoy it as much as I did.
