What The heck is going on with all these people waiting the show when they've only watched ONE DANG EPISODE?? Seriously? *sighs*

Now, I haven't finished the series myself (I'm in the middle of episode 7), but so far I think it's another home run from Netflix. The casting is amazing the story is intriguing, and the music Â– oh the music!!! 

It's wonderful to see more diversity in the MCU, and my worries about them not doing the series well have abated. I'm trying to be good and not binge the entire season, but it's such a good show with a variety of characters that haven't really been represented very much in the comics world, sadly. This is, however, a great first step towards making the universe more universal. 

p.s. Rosario Dawson is so incredibly awesome. I love that she's getting a more fleshed out role in this series. She is always a winner!!
