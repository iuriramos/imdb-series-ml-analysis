I've seen almost all of Marvels TV shows and films, including the Netflix shows 'Daredevil' and 'Jessica Jones', but as good as they were (Daredevil is still a favorite), I have to say that Luke Cage is brilliant (in my opinion). I do sometimes 'binge watch' some of Netflix TV shows (like 'Narcos' and 'Making a Murderer'), but this is the first time I watched a show from start to finish in one weekend (and now I have to wait almost a year until the next Season)! The characters, acting, actors, and even the way it's made is right up there as some of the best there is on TV today. The story kept me enthralled, I would finish one episode and would have to see the next, then the next! It was the same with Daredevil, I had to watch almost all of it within a week or two, as with Jessica Jones. Now I've found out they're making a 'Punisher' series as well as 'Iron Fist' series for Netflix also, this is great news! I hope they are as good as Luke Cage, Jessica Jones and Daredevil. If you haven't seen any of these shows, and you're a Marvel fan, then what the hell are you doing reading this review?? Go and watch them now, and I highly recommend 'Luke Cage'!
