I found little or nothing wrong with this show! I've only seen three episodes, but I'm sold! I like the writing, and actors not so familiar faces or the usual ones we see, so hooray for that! I love how the characters are fleshed out before we go into superhero mode! I'm not into action flicks without more than explosives and fights, but interesting storytelling is very important. Love the whole cast, the detective chick get cool points for playing basketball, I love that aspect added to her character! Luke Cage is just what we need right about now with so much going on in the world, in terms of moral decay and violence! Great Job!
