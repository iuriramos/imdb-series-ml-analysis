Well this certainly is not your usual Marvel TV series. I've read the other less than kind reviews. Luke Cage is different. It does seem slow but every moment is important in building both character and storyline. It makes such a change to have this genre make you think, rely less on special effects and fully immerse you in a tale that is both incredible and yet believable. To start it doesn't seem to gel or make sense but stick with it and it will grip you like a vice. Most episodes start with a flashback that satisfyingly is concluded at the end of said episode. Although you have cliffhangers you have total satisfaction and look forward to the next. If you simply want cgi and wild story lines then you'll have to look elsewhere.if you want a great script, great acting and something that pulls you in until you lose yourself. Luke Cage is the show to watch.
