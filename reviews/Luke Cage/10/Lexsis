SPOILER FREE REVIEW= As some may say the plot is simplistic, I found it to be very realistic and grounded in real life struggles. The story is driven by character emotion/interaction with a strong performance by Mike Colter (Luke Cage) and supporting cast. Not as action driven as the Daredevil series but becoming entrapped in character struggles makes the action more rewarding and meaningful. You even feel remorse for the main antagonist. It's nice to see the black community being represented than being a sidekick.

Netflix's has done it again with another excellent series. I will be extremely disappointed if the MCU recast the Netflix superheros for its movies as they have led people to believe.

Only problem with Luke Cage is after the binge watching I'm stuck waiting for the Defenders.
