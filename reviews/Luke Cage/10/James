On Saturday Netflix dropped the newest lineup to there Marvel series Luke Cage is the third series in this fast paced lineup. Cage is a comparable to Marvels the Daredevil the first in the Marvel lineup. Luke is a fast paced action hero who is not afraid to take a risk to protect the city of Harlem. Luke posses poise and extreme powers which include hard to penetrate skin and superhuman strength. The show is shot in an extremely similar fashion to Daredevil but the build up to the action is a little slower. This does not affect the excitement of the show because no matter how it is built up to Luke cage crashing through a building or pulling off a car door is always exciting. The series starts off slow with Luke not wanting to intervene on the streets of Harlem, but when his father figure and local hero Pop is killed in a drive by all hell breaks loose. Apart from the action Luke Cage does a fantastic job of bringing light to issues the African American community faces today. All in all, Luke Cage is action packed, exciting, and a great addition to the Marvel/Netflix family.
