The cast for this was awesome and each person played this part to perfection, would have love to Cotton Mouth stay around longer and watch him and Cage team up, but what a HELL of a ride for the 1st season! 

There were some slow parts but you had to have them to get to the action and bring it all together. The way it played out was masterful and creative. Mike Colter is just as equal the rest of the marvel cast, he owns Luke Cage and sets the ton for many more to come.

This by far is the 2nd best marvel yet! This is how you bring a comic book to life! Great job keep it up, Can't wait for the next season!
