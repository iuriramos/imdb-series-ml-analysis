Luke Cage is marvel's third netflix series and its better then Jessica Jones and better then Daredevil. There are things that they took away that made Luke cage Luke CAGE ! his comic was called Luke cage or power man or Luke cage Hero for hire.

He did the hero bit at first for money in trouble hire a superhero he named himself power man and later on discarded that title. and simply went by his name. when his book was on the brink of being cancelled they teamed him up with Iron fist and they had a great run.

This show captures the essence of the comic updated to the 21st century and its fantastic well done and it gives us a street hero that cares and sets a example of how this type of show should be done.

Nicely acted the story isn't a ground breaking story but its good enough to carry the 13 episodes with no problems. worth watching if the super hero genre is your cup of tea. If not then watch something else but if you like action and super heroes in general give it a shot .
