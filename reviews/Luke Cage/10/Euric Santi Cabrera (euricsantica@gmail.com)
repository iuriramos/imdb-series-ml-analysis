Just started to watch it a couple of hours and couldn't resist to keep watching. it was awesome. 

Since the first chapter to the last you will be triggered to emotion, pain, rage, excitement and love. Will not happen what you expect, but you will be expecting what happens. 

Marvel and Netflix did great with the screen writing, production, actors, even though some times Luke Cage (Mike Colter), losses his emotions and you can barely see some lots in the character, you can bypass that and enjoy it. 

Hope Marvel and Netflix keep up the pace on season two, because would be a waste that happens like Daredevil even though they are connected it can be taken out a lot more of these series. I am expecting season two, I'd wish would be now, but will have to wait. 

A must see movie, recommended 100%.
