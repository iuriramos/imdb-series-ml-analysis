There are some reviews about Luke Cage where you get the impression that the person likes to troll their own post to get a rise! The typical comments of that it should've been 6 not 13 episodes...I strongly disagree. At no point did anything feel drawn out and as with all of Netflix shows, every character gets to shine. One could say CW's DC stable is pushing it with 22 episodes every year, but they have more money and suited execs to please.

Mike Colter gets to flex (no pun intended) his acting muscles and really shines all the way through; and very happy that Rosario Dawson is given more time on-screen as Night Nurse Claire Temple. In fact, every cast member is memorable in their own way (Simone Missick, Alfre Woodard, Theo Rossi, Mahershala Ali and Erik LaRay Harvey).

I cannot believe that some people felt the music score was distracting (the same approach is used in War on Everyone where a 70s-style riff is played in certain scenes, even though it's set in the present day. I'm guessing some reviewers aren't intelligent to get it's meant to be anachronistic). And hey, if it reminds you of Black Dynamite, even better because I love that film!

Unlike the MCU where the villains tend to be the weakest part of those films, DD, JJ and now LC have strong antagonists who pull many strings. Don't go looking for plot holes, sit back and be mesmerised at the acting, writing, social commentary and bone-crunching action. Over to you, Punisher!
