I read the comic and this Cage is different. He doesn't get mad, kill anyone or use a gun. What you are viewing is an educated black man that is strong and bullet proof, around a bunch of others that are either controlled my their emotions or stupid. At first view the show seemed dead in spots, then I went back and looked again and those dead spots had relevance today. "he is always thinking." Even though Luke was the star, the councilwoman was really scary. She reminded me of Hilary Clinton. 

The hoody scenes were extremely funny. This show could have taken place in any city were corrupt people live. If you watch it, imagine Luke Cage in Washington D.C.
