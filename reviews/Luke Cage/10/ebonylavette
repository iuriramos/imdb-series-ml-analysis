Who has time to write a novel about a Netflix serious? Simply put I loved every episode. Guess who's about to make it about race? Me. Refreshing to see a black man as a superhero helping his own and going against what white supremacy thinks a black men is. All black men/women/children aren't Violent, heartless, no emotion, rapist and other vile things. I encourage anyone black to watch this serious and if you have a teenager who is at that age, sit down and watch it with them also watch "Hidden colors", "The 13th", Dick Gregory and Dr Umar Johnson. Please take some time and research these videos and black educators. If anyone who doesn't understand my comment simply means its not for you to understand. Just like we won't understand why people suck Africa dry of its resources and wonder why the place is violent and poor.
