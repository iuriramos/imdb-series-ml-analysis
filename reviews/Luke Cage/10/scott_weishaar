The Netflix/Marvel partnership just keeps on kicking out great shows and Luke Cage doesn't let down a bit. I'm disappointed they can't put out a season a year like normal shows, but the quality is excellent helping offset some of the pain. I can understand they are ramping up, but 3 years between the first season of Jessica Jones and the second? Maybe they bit off to much? Only problem with that statement is that the quality is just staying at the 9/10 level which would stand against that statement. Luke Cage does a good job of tying in loose references to Jessica Jones and the other Marvel/Netflix shows. Like having the doc show up in a more substantial role. Good Ending leaving me expecting a season 2 that will raise the bar even higher. Keep it up!!!
