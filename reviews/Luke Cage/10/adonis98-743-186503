Given superstrength and durability by a sabotaged experiment, a wrongly accused man escapes prison to become a superhero for hire. Luke Cage the 3rd installment on the Marvel/Netflix TV Shows is for sure not as good as Jessica Jones or in my opinion the best of them all Daredevil. But what i like about their shows is how different they are the first one is 100% superhero, the 2nd one is 100% detective and the 3rd one is 100% gangster type of show. Also their villains continue to dominate with Mahershala Ali being another great villain in their TV show collection too bad that the Cinematic ones are awful villains such as Zemo from Civil War for example Kingpin for sure remains the best one tho for me and Kilgrave comes in the 2nd place what also makes Cornell a great villain is that he has a code as well and he won't take any sh*t if he wants you dead you will be dead. Also without the doubt the best scene is from episode one when one of the thugs tries to punch him in the face and he breaks his hand so awesome. Marvel's Luke Cage continues strong and respects the previous 2 entries and proves that the 3rd installment is not always as bad as some people might say Sweet Christmas!!!
