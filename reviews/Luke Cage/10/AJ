Cheo Hodari Coker has introduced an epic narrative inspired by Marvel's most legendary Black superhero into an artistically cinematic melody delivered in 13 classic bars. This series, Luke Cage, has taken an historical pen and ink concept and painted a polarizing modern day mural like no other hero movie has ever done.

The social, political, and historical commentary sprinkled throughout this series was presented with absolute perfection - laced with one of the most beautiful soundtracks I've ever heard.

For those viewers or critics who don't get it - just won't get it - because this series is just way too smart for them.
