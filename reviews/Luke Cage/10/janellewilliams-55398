So here's the thing: Luke Cage is a show by Black people, for Black people, about Black people. Now if your done crying and feeling oppressed, I'd like to talk about the show.

I watch every Marvel show faithfully, and Luke Cage is he most superior by far- that includes Daredevil and Jessica Jones.

Mike Colter is truly a work of art (and I'm not just talking about his body). The way he can convey such moving performances without ever raising his voice or even moving around is truly powerful. Simone Missick gives a great breakout performance as Detective Misty Knight while her hair stayed fresh all 13 episodes. Rosario Dawson continues to kick ass as the titular Claire Temple.

I won't spoil it any further but I can calmly tell you Luke Cage is the best Marvel show currently in existence. Anyone in denial just hates Black Excellence.
