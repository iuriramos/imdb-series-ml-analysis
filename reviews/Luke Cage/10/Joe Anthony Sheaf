There is a cancer in our society and that is people who thing they are superior for not liking something. Sure this show may have its flaws, but it does EXACTLY what it is set out to do. Entertain. Not every show is going to be perfect, but if you go into a show just looking for everything wrong with it, of course you are going to have a bad time. Granted, I watched the first episode and I thought it was a bit slow, the second episode picked up that a little and then, the third episode hit, I was so excited for everything else that the show had in store for me. Do not guide yourself by the negative reviews, they were obviously expecting way to much, probably by the hype the trailer generated. This is a very awesome show and if you stick with it, you are definitely going to have an amazing time watching it. It has plenty of action, while not getting bogged down by too much explosions and fight scenes to keep people entertained. Most people will give some lame excuse to give this show a low rating and I disagree. I just want to say I had a blast, I was smiling, I was tense, I was having so much fun with this and I can't wait to see every other season that they make.
