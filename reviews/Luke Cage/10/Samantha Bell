I've committed to binge watch each Marvel Netflix series with my boyfriend and once again, Marvel knocked it out of the park! Not even worth a comparison to Jessica Jones or Daredevil. If we are comparing, my only negative critique would be to have the villains be a bit stronger like Wilson Fisk. I enjoyed every second of this amazing ride through Harlem! Each Netflix originals have been amazing in their own ways! The soundtrack was also great! Just like any Marvel series, there were quite a number of Easter Eggs which my boyfriend and I love! I am looking forward to next season of Luke Cage. Whoever is giving this series a bad review is craaaaaaaazy.
