A great series, I really enjoyed it. The cast was superb, with sterling acting to boot! 

As a lifelong Marvel comic book fan am really enjoying the screen translations. They aren't always cannon (X-men being a jarring example) but, all in all, directors, writers and cast in "filmland" finally seem to be understanding comic book fans don't need or want their heroes recreated in some twisted, (flawed) visionary-artsy way. They'd rather see their old childhood heroes translated into the modern world in as-plausible a manner as possible and the Netflix series don't disappoint! 

To me some parts of Daredevil season 1 and Jessica Jones seemed unnecessarily slow, not so with Luke Cage! I enjoyed every episode in the season! Well done Netflix you've got me completely hooked! I hope Iron Fist and the Defenders don't disappoint!
