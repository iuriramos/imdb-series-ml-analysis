So very good/ I love MARVEL and this one is rated at the top with the rest. Mike Colter Rocks. Raphael Saddiq rocks with the soul, funk infused soundtrack. Luke Cage has the feel of a classic. even though its similar to Daredevil, Jessica Jones it still feels fresh and new. The Music is great, the setting of Harlem I believe that Luke Cage has the best villain we've seen, so far, in the entire Marvel Universe, and no, it is not the villain you first see or suspect, and neither is it the only, sort of, super-foe the show has, just keep watching the episodes, especially the last one, and you'll soon notice... the first episode, WHO'S GONNA TAKE THE WEIGHT, really get the ball rolling It is a good show/ I don't understand people who want more It is marvel..and a good one
