The show obviously is linked with a motorcycle gang that really exists (maybe mixed with other stuff), even Ron Pearlman accidentally says Hells Angels during Season 1 (it's in the Gag Reel which can be seen as a special feature on the discs). You also have people who were with the Angels attached to the show with different roles to it. David L. is one of them, though his acting skills do lack a bit, he's as authentic as it gets.

Kurt Sutter who created this, is also known to be involved in the Shield series. And throughout the 7 seasons of SoA you can see a lot of cast members returning to play one role or another, sometimes for just one episode sometimes recurring (watch out for Walton Goggins, who has one of the craziest guest roles in this).

Even without being a bike fanatic and even though the show does have either convenient ways to ease up on things or make them really complicated, the show is really well made. Not only from a technical stand point, but also from the point of character development. You could argue, that some of the characters are not given enough screen time and that some plots could have been explored more, but as it is, the show is (or rather was since it's through now) as thrilling as it needs to be.

And while this is based in reality, that doesn't mean that some things happening, have to be "real". There's a lot of death, though no frontal nudity (I think that has something to do with the policies of FX channel), but still sex thrown in there from time to time. The relationships seem to shift suddenly at times, but all is somehow connected and the show tries to keep it as logical as possible (that also can be attributed to character decisions, no matter how stupid they may seem to the viewer).

While it not quite reaches the heights of Sopranos or Breaking Bad, this is another good example how to spin something bad, to make it look somewhat good in comparison to others in that created world ...
