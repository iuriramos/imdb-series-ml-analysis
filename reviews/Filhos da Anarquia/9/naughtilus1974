S.O.A is a well written well acted show.While it is not realistic,and often times hilariously unbelievable,it is very entertaining.It is obvious a lot of thought was put in to the writing.I do wish however,it was on a premium network such as HBO.That being said it is well worth the time invested to watch it.I recently watched the entire Breaking Bad series,and to me this is a better show.There are more moving parts and more time invested in character set up.Although the members are criminals,you find yourself rooting for them more times than not.If the show is appreciated for what it is (fiction) it is a can't miss.IMO Kurt Sutter has created a gem and I for one can't wait to see any of his future work.
