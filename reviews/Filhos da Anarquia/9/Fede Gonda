First of all, what i'm going to write next it's only my opinion. This is a huge serial, that i loved from beginning to end. I think SOA it's a perfect case of study if you are trying to learn how to write a script. It's my favorite serial even though the cinematography isn't' he best. I didn't like the color correction through the entire serial, i think that sometimes it lowers the cinematography level. I really enjoyed the script, the way you get to know the characters is amazing, the plot twists in every season are huge. I sincerely recommend to watch this serial to every serial lover. It doesn't matter where you come from, this serial will catch you.
