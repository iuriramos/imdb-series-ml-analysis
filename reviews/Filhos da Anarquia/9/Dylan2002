Great series with a great plot. I loved it up to season 7 which is crap. Jax turns from a "real-life" character to a complete psychopath, killing tons of people, including ..., getting away with it, and immediately getting back to routine club issues like nothing happened. Minimal acting guidelines should have been to look more human and less like a robot while doing that... Chibs and the rest of the club follow him like pappies, not questioning Jax's actions even a little. Also seems unreal. In general season 7 plot is weak and quixotic, to a point it even becomes ridiculous. Sorry but series should have ended at S06...
