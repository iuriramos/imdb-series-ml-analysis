I don't know why some of you hate the show but in my opinion it couldn't be written better. So stop acting like series master and actually watch it till the end . Acting is great although Jax could be played by someone else but it's still great actor and his accent is great in the show. Soundtracks of the show are going really nice with the show and mood of certaing scenes and cuts. So before typing something with voting 1 of 10 actually get all points of view of the show. Yea show isn't masterpiece but it really puts you in to watch till the end. If you don't like the show its because you don't like that type of the series, go watch Game of Thrones or something that you are interested more than this. I really love the show can't wait for season 6 and I hope for exciting end. Actors are very well chosen for the show except Jax could be played by someone more like John Teller.

Cheers
