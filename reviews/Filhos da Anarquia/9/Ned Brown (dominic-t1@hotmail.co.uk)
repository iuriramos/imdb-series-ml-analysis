I just purchased SOA seasons 1-2 on DVD the other day and have to say it was definitely the best show since The Sopranos. The acting is just great Charlie Hunnam, Katey Sagal, Ron Pearlman and Mark Boone Junior all do fantastic jobs. the story line is just flawless, a bunch of guys who ride bikes, run the town and kick the crap out of other gangs what's more awesome than that? It is a good mix of drama, crime and a few black comedy moments. You get to know the characters very well and to know and understand their lives and learn to love or hate the way the Sons Of Anarchy live. 

it's one of those shows that is totally original and will probably go down in history as one of the best shows of all time.

All in all this is an amazing show and one of the most original. It takes you into the lives of motorcycle brotherhood thugs who live life the way a lot of people in my opinion can only dream of living.

10/10 Just awesome, one of the greatest shows on TV!
