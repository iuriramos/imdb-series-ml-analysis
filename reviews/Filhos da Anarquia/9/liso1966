I was a huge skeptic over Sons of Anarchy. I actually wasted; Yes Wasted! two full seasons ignoring this gem of a show. I am caught up now.

The reason for my title? This is truly the best show that services the best of what men and women both want in a show. It truly has it all! Sexy, dangerous, brutal, edgy. romantic, dramatic, and very well written.

The actors are as diverse as the show itself. Each with a flare and personality rich with character. It is truly impossible not to find something great about each and every one. Be it hate, love, like or lust this cast. Each and every emotion has been brought on by superb acting, writing, wrapped up with the general environment created.

I only have one minor complaint over season 3. It should be called "Chasing Able" As it seems the entire season is about finding Jackson's child. I feel it has gone on a bit to long. Regardless of that though? I still get giddy on Tuesday nights to watch this edgy and creative show.
