At first glance, it does seem rather basic and familiar with the motorcycle gang trying to earn their way, building and breaking alliances along the way that lead to bloodshed. However, the main storyline at play here is all about Jax and the other-worldly consciousness that overcomes him. Over the seasons his attempts to break away and legitimize the MC consume the majority of the conflict that provides our viewing entertainment. A closer look sees a struggling man, husband, father, friend, and son, and no matter how hard he tries, every step forward he takes creates a fallout of two steps back. He can never get ahead, he can never reach his goal. Thus, we see the evolution of Jax turning into the very thing he hoped never to be. While I greatly enjoy the various subplots, I applaud Kurt Sutter for never losing focus of the main story. The character development gives us a connection so deep to these characters, it is hard not to be moved by Jax's struggles and their consequences. While I have my suspicions and hopes for season 7, I cannot imagine Sutter disappointing us in the end. Ultimately, what I have come to understand about this show is that you may not like what happens, but you understand why things had to happen.
