*********************ONLY MINUTE SPOILERS*******************

I absolutely love Sons of Anarchy. It's a FX, television version of shows like, The Wire, The Sopranos and Deadwood. SOA seems like it should be on a network like HBO and though it may lose something small in the cable translation, it's also a success where many HBO shows that were similar were canceled prematurely.

The third season of SOA lags to be honest. While I was perfectly happy as a fan of watching the everyday toils of the Sons of Anarchy in Charming, the show felt the need to turn SOA into Belfast Bikers which is what I feel I'm watching most of this season. Unfortunately like many shows before it, SOA felt the need escalate the show as the seasons progressed. I feel other fans like me would much prefer them keeping the show on the level we've learned to love. When I say all of this I think of Dexter and how it started so strong and tried to build the show into something bigger when I the fan would've been happy with more of the same. Dexter eventually pulled themselves out of the lag and the series as a whole is still great. I'm still working on finishing season 3. Hopefully they'll pull themselves out of the Belfast lag. Hopefully even by seasons end.

Still a great show with my full recommendation. If you like any of the other shows I've mentioned in this review I have no doubt you'll love Sons.

9 of 10 - Television doesn't get much better.
