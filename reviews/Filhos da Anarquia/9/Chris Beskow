There always comes a moment in someone's life when a motorcyclist cuts him/her off. Most people react in anger, if not they are probably texting or high off their ass. After watching the show, Sons of Anarchy, I felt connected to the motorcyclists for some time, it was as if I could finally see the camaraderie that comes with being part of a club. Of course that only lasted a short time, which ended once a motorcyclist flipped me off for braking at a yellow light when I could've continued. SOA is a fantastic show, one that grips you from beginning to the end, it is my second favorite show so far, only behind the perfection that is Breaking Bad. The show starts off with the fantastic song by The Black Keys 'Hard Row', and even though I felt nothing for the main character at that point, I knew that he made driving a motorcycle look Bad-Ass. The pilot feels a bit jumbled, I probably only remembered three character's names by the end of it, but I quickly became engrossed by the aspect of a gang of that was based around the almost poetic freedom of riding a Harley. After the pilot, I knew that I had to continue watching, but I never expected to really car for the characters as much as I do now. The writing beautifully unravels the story, which many point out is quite similar to Hamlet. There isn't really fantastic camera work in relation to characters, but I have to say that the scenic shots of the Sons riding down the highway made it feel almost as if you were there, witnessing a roaring and unstoppable beast rip through the wastelands of California. SOA is an amazing show, one that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end, and for my fellow binge-watchers an experience almost on par to that of Breaking Bad.
