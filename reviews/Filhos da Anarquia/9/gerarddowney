A son discovers that his mother and her lover have killed his father and have taken over the motor cycle club that should have belonged to his father. He embarks on his revenge, and his Harley. Unlike Hamlet this young prince marries his love and has children. Over time, seasons of the series, his wife changes into a lady Macbeth type character but who could blame her? The answer most of the club, an ex-sheriff, and some of the best character actors in American television. If some actor has distinguished him or herself in television watch the series long enough and you will see them here. At the time I am writing recent episodes have had Donal Logue, CCH Pounder and Peter Weller. The series pushes the limit of what networks have traditionally allowed on television but Sons' heart, if not groin, is in the right place.
