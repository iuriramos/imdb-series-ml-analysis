Sons of Anarchy reaches in to the lives of the outlaw biker attitude and gives it a whole new light. Grasping your attention and affection through strong acting and wonderful writing. The story is a tragic heart-breaker especially toward the end, but I'm not going to spoil what happens. The show kills off some of its best characters but in doing so it keeps everything constantly fresh, there are times when it drags, but not enough to complain too much about. A solid 9/10 and if you haven't seen this series yet, get on Netflix and get to watching it. It's a good one, one of my favorites of all time. Everything from the acting, story, cinematography, and scenery add to the lure of the outlaw biker group known as SAMCRO.
