Very hooked on this show. I like the fact that one qualifies as a "good guy." Virtually everyone has an illegal demon in their closet. Pretty typical in a Shakespeare tragedy. It's easy to find a character who is interesting, but difficult to find one to root for. I hope they take advantage of the Agent Stahl character. She's a hoot. Definitely a woman operating in a man's world there.The sound track is excellent. It has a very blues/alternative country feel. I especially liked the instrumental "Fortunate Son" and the season ending "John the Revalator" A big fan of Ron Perlman, but would have liked to see what Scott Glenn would have done in the role. It's good to see Katey Segal in action. She's the glue behind the scene holding the gang/family together. It will be interesting to see how they deal with the prospect getting his colors or not.
