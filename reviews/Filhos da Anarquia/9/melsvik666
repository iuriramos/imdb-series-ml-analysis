I love this show, and cant believe I didn't watch it before. But at some level I'm happy about that, because now I can enjoy five whole seasons without a break and then the sixth season will be up in the fall. Its so exiting, and it really leaves you breathless at some points. You end up sitting on the tip of the couch leaning against the TV (or pc) and wonder whats gonna happen next.

I think the cast is amazing, they are growing on me for every episode too.

If you think you have to love bikes and tattoos to watch this show, you're wrong. Its a good show for everybody, not kids though obviously, but you get what I mean.

Go Jax!
