A friend of mine recommended me this show a few years ago,so I decided to give it a chance,and i wasn't mistaken.At the beginning and at the first two seasons things were going smoothly and calmly,just to explain the past of the samcro,but then everything changed,a whole other story.Each member of the club has his own history,and they all follow their president at whatever his say until the end.The story was very very good with lots of surprises and with many twists,really this story can taught you a lot.The choice of songs were terrific especially at the last scene of the series,these seven last minutes with that song will be in mind for ever.
