If somebody were to ask you if you could ever feel yourself to be part of a gang which ruthlessly murders & tortures people and feeds guns to organized crime, you answer would probably be an outraged 'No'. However, when you are watching this series, not only do you feel yourself to be there among these outlaws, witnessing their every good or bad action, laughing with them, riding with them, drinking with them and crying with them, you also start understanding them. You understand the outlaw code, why they do what they do, why it is so important for them to make it right with those who wrong them, why a club is at least as important to them as their families. 

I believe that any show or movie is successful only if, at any point in the show, you feel exactly what the director wants you to feel. While watching this series, there were times when I was filled with revulsion for Gemma Teller and there were other moments when I sympathized with that very same character and at some level I even understood why she did what she did. That's the power of characterization in a show and it manifests itself when the viewers start understanding the characters at such level that they don't need any rationalizations for the actions of the characters. The character of the protagonist Jax Teller has been portrayed beautifully and successfully shows a man tormented by his internal conflicts in doing justice to both his family and his outlaw organization. He understands everything and tries to set things right but in the end has to embrace his destiny. 

Throughout the series, and especially in the last season, the plot was wonderfully set such that everything comes together and fits nicely and snugly. 

On the acting front both Charlie Hunnam and Katy Segal have done an excellent job of bringing to life a highly conflicted and a highly resolute characters respectively.

Overall, loved this show.
