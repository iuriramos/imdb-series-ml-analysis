There is a house in Charming Town They call the Rising Sun It's been the ruin of many a poor girl And me, Oh God, I'm one

If I listened to my mama Lord I'd be home today But I was young and foolish Handsome rider led me astray

Go tell my baby sister never do what I've done To shun the house in Charming Town They call the Rising Sun

My Mother, she's a tailor She sowed my new blue jeans My sweetheart he's a rambler Lord he rides an old machine

Now the only thing a rambler needs is a suitcase and a gun the only time he's satisfied is when he's on the run

He fills his chamber up with lead and takes his pain to town the only pleasure he gets out of life is bringing another man down

He's got one hand on the throttle the other on the brakes he's riding back to Redwood to own his father's stake

And me I wait in Charming Town To gain my love as one I'm staying here to end my life Down in the Rising Sun

I'm staying here to end my life Down in the Rising Sun
