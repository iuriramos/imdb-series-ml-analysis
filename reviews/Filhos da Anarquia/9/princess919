I am in awe of Katey Sagal. I've loved her as a comic actress for so long that this show really threw me. The first episode I ever saw was season one episode six (Skateboard scene), she was amazing, crazy, strong and vulnerable all at the same time. Quite a shock for someone who thought she was a great mother figure in 8 simple rules... I immediately started to search for past episodes online and continued to watch each episode as it came out. She and Ron were a perfect match, there's chemistry between them and in every scene they are together they steal the show. Charlie Hunnam is convincing as an American despite his British origins (I know he's been acting in America a few times but the accent's hard to lose, trust me!) and he's got a great talent, he's totally believable as a new single father.

With it's subject matter this show could have been so much darker but there's humour throughout it all. Every character is well rounded and perfectly cast.

I recommend this show to people all the time and now I do it here to, with it's amazing season 2 ending I have been on edge for weeks now. September's on it's way and so is season 3, I can't wait!!!
