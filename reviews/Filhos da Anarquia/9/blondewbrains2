Love love love this show... hate hate hate how he kills off too many main characters and his wife's death just killed me... I swore I wouldn't watch the last season for this very fact but couldn't help myself.. need to know where Charlie goes from here.. argh... Im also frustrated that I have to write so many lines to submit my review. I mean, if you really want peoples views, I don't think asking for so many lines is necessary.. how much can you write about the show without giving everything up to the watcher. I highly recommend this show if you want to pull your hair out, cry and feel overwhelming anger for so many people. Will miss Ron Pearlman. He was a well hated man.
