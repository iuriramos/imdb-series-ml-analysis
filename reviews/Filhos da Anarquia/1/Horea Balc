Inconsistent, full of clich√©, cock-and-bull, ... A movie for low IQ people. Really don t know if those five stars raters are mentally sane ! A "skinny" scenario full of inaccuracies about a motorcycle gang struggles to emerge law. The main actor seems rather an idiot led by a decrepit mother who killed his father and then his wife. If all the bad guys would resemble Jax Teller then America is the country where the police profession must be very boring. The most spectacular character is a priapic, Tig Trager, others are a colorful bunch of idiots easily fooled and blinded by instinct rather than ruled by reason. I wonder if the real villains from America were thought to protest against this series which seriously affect their image.
