Sons of Anarchy was really great at the beginning, some of the scenes were corny and clich√©, but all-around it was a great action series with a bit of character drama.

Why did I rate this show a 1? Simple, season 5 ruined the show!

Spoiler alert!

They turned Tara into an ultra-strong manipulative b***h that is constantly going from helping the club to ruining it and turned Jax into a p***y whipped b***h that believes everything Tara says. To make things even worse in season 6 they added political correctness to the now disastrous show by adding transvestites, turning one of the bikers gay, annihilating a start up white supremacist gang for a minor infraction while doing hardly anything to other groups who killed some of their members and giving them all even cornier sappy feelings about what they do.

I have not yet finished season 6, a few episodes to go, but i'm hoping someone has the brains to try salvaging this series by brutally killing off Tara and even the whipped Jax.
