I can imagine if I were a dirty rotten 13 years old and were living with my abusive drugged out parents in a trailer park, I would certainly LOVE THIS SHOW! But then again, how would I be able to watch this? Oh yeah, an illegal satellite connection!

But here I am, 43 years old. 

So who is this show for?

Certainly not for me!

I've watched almost 3 seasons so far and the 3rd season is by far the MOST RIDICULOUS one yet! (but I read in season 6 someone becomes a tranny!!! omg!) Is this show meant to be a comedy? Are the guys one day gonna start dancing and singing their dialogue?

OK, I digress...

The episode where Tara and her co-worker (boss) are kept by a couple which demand $250,000, gets stolen by 2 kids on bikes (pedals), and the ATF agents and SOA members can't catch them?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? COME ON!!!! The VP's (Jacks) infant child is in Belfast, they get a dozen chances to catch "the bad guy" yet he ALWAYS gets away!?!?!? COME ON!!!!

This is by far the most CARTOONISH TV SHOW I have ever watched. I am not gonna repeat all the other PATHETIC things that other reviewers have noticed about this show, cause I would be writing all day.

I would much rather watch The Sopranos. At least, I cared for ALL OF THEIR Characters.

Not to mention THE EMOTIONLESS MONOTONE SPEAKING VOICE of "JACKS"

btw...Who the heck is Sam Crow?!?! Or is it SAMCRO!?!?!?

These guys are hardened killer bikers! Yeah right!

lmao.
