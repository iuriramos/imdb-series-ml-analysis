When compared to other shows involving crime/criminal gangs SOA is by far the worst. The show involves many murders, including murders of police and government agent. More then half the time the members of the SOA don't hide bodies or any evidence yet they rarely get arrested. When they do get arrested they always mange to get out of trouble in the most crazy, unreal ways. Not only are the members of the SOA immune from the law but also bullets/fatal injury. In almost every shoot out with any other gangs the SOA are always the winner and usually unharmed. Whether its neo-Nazis, street gangs, Mexican drug cartels, the IRA, rival biker clubs, or drug kingpins the SOA are always on top. When members are shot the always have a doctor ready to fix them up. Members rarely die. The wives and girlfriends of members are also very violent and immune to the cops and injury. Some of the police also help the club get away with many crimes. The show also gets very annoying when you have to hear "Jesus Christ" and "Christ" 30 times in every episode. Like the writers couldn't think of another word for every time something bad is shared with other members. I do not recommend this show to any one looking for a serious show about biker gangs/crime. But it is defiantly a great show to share some laughs at the ridiculous fight scenes and police escapes with a couple friends.
