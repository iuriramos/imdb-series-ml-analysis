I put up with a few of these SOA shows to see what people were bragging about since I'm a long time, high miles Harley rider. I was getting to know the characters and they were tolerable, but I realized the shows were constantly filled with strife, violence, lies, hatred, ughhhhh, Gimme a break, how can anyone continually watch this crap??? Not to mention that there are no clubs I know that are this bad-boy stupid.

And then came the show with the transvestite... worst show I can ever remember seeing on TV. Who is writing this garbage??? No more for me, I can't believe Harley advertises with this manure. The low budget 90's Renegade TV series show with Lorenzo Lamas was a better biker fantasy show than this.

Seems I gotta write some more (10 lines). Well folks, good luck with your lame, aggravating fantasy viewing, this should fill your void.

Yeah, and every show starts out with the same warning in the exaggerated horror voice, "Viewer Discretion Advised", but they forget to tell the real reason... Mind numbing stupidity, unless your a mental zombie. Sorry for the harsh words, but that transvestite episode was out of line in association with bikers, even fantasy bikers.
