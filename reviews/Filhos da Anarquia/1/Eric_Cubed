I loved this show, and have given it five stars up to now. However when Kurt Sutter sank to a level of such sadistic inhuman depravity as to graphically rape himself on screen, well, that went a little too far. This scene was so overwhelmingly disgusting and viciously brutal it will forever be burned into my memory banks. Remember you can't "unsee" something. You see, it was then that I realized what this show is really about: Kurt Sutter's graphically sick, self-indulgent, self-absorbed, twisted vision of human life. Really, that is his true intention, and overall the only value this show has to offer. Is it interesting and engaging at times? Yes. Is it full of awesome acting and, I'll admit, plenty of good writing? Yes. But that doesn't excuse the rotten core of this vile excuse for creativity. Breaking Bad had similar scenes, though not quite as disturbing. Kurt Sutter wishes he could be Vince Gilligan and fails miserably, in the most awful and egregious way. While Breaking Bad was cosmic in its character study (for which the violence was in the service of), Sutter's Suns is the exact opposite: he uses his characters as a backdrop for the vehicle of his own sick, personal projections. At least Quentin Tarantino had artistic vision. What an utter waste of celluloid.
