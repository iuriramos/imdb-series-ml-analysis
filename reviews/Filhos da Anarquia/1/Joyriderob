First off, I can't believe how this show could ever get a positive review. Kurt Sutter you must really love your wife, because you wrote this show for her, she get's away with everything in this very unrealistic show. Second no real MC (not the lawyer and doctors MC) would do stupid mistakes and decisions like these no way in hell, maybe you should have done more research on real MC's like H.A. how they operate and run their club's. In the it was a complete waste of time watching this show, Kurt Sutter please give me my time back. After watching Breaking Bad this one's not going to make it for me. I was hoping to find something real and intelligent about the series, total disappointed and I can't enjoy watching the entire series, unbelievable story lines, outrageous bad acting. Started getting so ridiculous I quit watching. Saw it on the lineup this season so I thought I'd catch an episode to see if it was any better. I couldn't get through the first 10 minutes of the tranny and ass rape scene that unfolded... REALLY? very low.
