While the actors show there talent, the characters are mind-numbing, first off the show itself is not worth watching on commercial television and at times the commercials have better content and are more interesting then the SOA show itself, but still the commercials drive me away from the show, SOA is not worth waiting through the commercials.

I happened upon a set of SOA DVDs for loan so I could sit down without the insidious commercials pestering me while I watch the show and not kill my interest with unrelenting harassment to spend my money.

What I found was, most of the members of SOA are a bunch of cut throat snitches, I lost my interest but I kept watching anyway and found 5 hours into the show was a bunch of predictable plots one right after the other.

I was thinking I have done nothing but wasted time that I could have spent watching something with plots on the evolutionary scale higher then Wile e Coyote.

I'm pleased the DVDs were just a loan; to spend money on the repetitive plots would be the same as tossing cash in the garbage can. Time wasted I will never get back.
