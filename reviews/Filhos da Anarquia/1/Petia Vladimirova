Honestly I expected more from this show. Started watching it late, not finished all seasons yet, but it's not as great as more people use to say. It's more a big family drama than anything else. First season was worst, second I liked, next are just boring. Never ending lies and secrets of Gemma, brutal murders of Clay and Jax who is always wondering and always have a doubt about everything. Every episode shows how they plot against each other, kissing and embracing each other and a little shooting between bands. There is always a chick with broken nose and too much drama. Not enough good sex scenes, not enough about the other members of the club relationships and life, not enough rock music or good shots of any of them, their bikes or whatever. It's so banal and the same. They work in auto service, it supposed to show some cars and bikes, talk about it, not even a word about that. It's always the same - lies, shooting, kisses. It begins to pall after a few episodes watched. And about Jack, I really liked this man more with long hair despite he rarely washed it. Can't even comment his dressing style, he have a nice body and wearing hobo clothes all the time. Just this show is a big disappointment for me as a fan of rough playing, rock music and fast driving, bikes and classic cars at all. They could do much more.

I can't believe how this movie can downplay all the good human sences and emotions, and turn them to something so banal and lower. I really hate I lost my time watching this movie, really. I never actually enjoyed it, none of it.
