Well someone somewhere thought 'hey what if we put the Sopranos on bikes and gave them loads of tattoos' and the other Idiot in the room said 'great Idea, have some money!' I have to confess I have only watched the first episode but on the 'strength' of what I have seen I will not be watching any more. The Sopranos drew you in and after a few series I realised that they were all evil people with no redeeming features but I did watch all of them. Ten minutes in to this and you realise they are ALL vile, corrupt, hypocritical murderous psychopaths and that's just the women! I think you are supposed to empathise with the son but he brutally beats some guy to a pulp over something I have no doubt he would condone if the guy had been wearing his colours.The 'bad' guys seem to be distinguished only by the fact that they are even uglier than the SOA! Its just a series about a bunch of lowlife scum, why we need to see or 'explore'this incredibly seedy,sleazy and worthless aspect of modern life is beyond me.This series cheapens us all.I knew how this episode would end about half way through and it was so clich√©d I burst out laughing.Pathetic.
