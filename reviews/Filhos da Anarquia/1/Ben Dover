First couple of seasons were OK, nothing spectacular but OK. Unbelievable story lines, outrageous bad acting (especially the pompous, egotistically pouty whispering pussy Jax). Started getting ridiculous so I quit watching. Saw it on the lineup this season so I thought I'd catch an episode to see if it was any better. I couldn't get through the first minute of the tranny and ass rape scene that unfolded... REALLY? It was already bad enough but they felt they had to up their game and turn it into a fagfest. Truly the worst "show" ever. Really beginning to wonder if I need to drop FX from my favorites if this is the garbage they pump out.
