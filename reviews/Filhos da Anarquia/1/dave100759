I might just watch it all again to find out a)The total number of deaths; b)How many times people call each other "bro", "momma" or "homes" c) How many times the phrase "We need to get the Intell" is used. The show is extremely clich√©d and predictable. At best it is a cross between the A-Team and The Cannonball Run. Except for Jimmy Smits the acting was poor. Direction and continuity, well let us just say below par. The story-line was a little bit on the naive side. all credit to the actors and the crew for sticking with the synopsis for so many seasons.

I watch all shows and movies from start to finish. There can be no comment if you do not complete the task.
