I guess folks that love network TV and can't or haven't ever watched an HBO or AMC series rank this show pretty high because maybe it's all they have for comparison. That being said, this show is rotten. The acting may be the worst of any show I've ever seen that is rated above an 8.5 on IMDb with this number of ratings. The plot is pretty silly all around. Maybe it picks up in the third season, but I couldn't make it that far. Who would...

If you want real drama series that is amazing, watch the Wire, Sopranos, Breaking Bad or hell, even Prison Break. This show is a hot mess.
