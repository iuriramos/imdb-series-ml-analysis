I get it: Real MC are not like SOA. 

I accept that in order to run a show, the creator has to dramatize it. But to the very least, the story has to be plausible. So many things in this show are so beyond belief that it's impossible to take it serious.

Even worse, the characters in this melodrama are utterly disgusting. They are, for lack of a better description, a bunch of white trash criminals. The innocent get killed. The weak get bullied. And there is this girl with an MD - medical doctor - willing to join the motor gang to do all the disgusting things with them. 

Give me a break.
