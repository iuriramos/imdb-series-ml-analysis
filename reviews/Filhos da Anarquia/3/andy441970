Full of clich√©s, bravado and posturing. Almost totally predictable. We know the bad guys will lose, in almost every confrontation, every fight, and of course, in the end.

In every gun fight bullets almost always seem to miss our heroes, and the "bad" guys almost always exist for the sole purpose of being beaten to a pulp by the main characters. Even when the bad guys are two to one, and holding guns against our heroes, we know they are seconds from being overpowered and beaten.

Season 3 was a let down too, as we continue to watch the bad guys committing monumental errors of judgement. An FBI agent that has staked her whole career and life into capturing a famous terrorist, to the point of murdering her colleague and cutting deals with gang members. Yet, after 12 whole episodes and once finally in possession of the terrorist, she decides to stay alone, without protection inside known gangland territory, and get ambushed and killed. In anything vaguely resembling reality, a known terrorist arrest would involve a detachment of an army unit for everyone's protection.

The main characters are similarly badly scripted, with sociopathic and schizophrenic behaviour, including a loyal gang member whose wife and mother of two young kids is murdered by the gang leaders, yet he remains loyal in the gang.

I can't write more the whole thing is so terrible and now I am watching how the bad guys will get beaten too, it's just a matter of seconds... Hmm by the time I wrote this, the bad guys, the Russians, in full control of the situation, just sit there and become punch bags for our heroes to shine once again. Why even bother showing it since we know how it's going to end...
