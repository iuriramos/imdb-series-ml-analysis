So I recently started watching this show based on the reviews here. I couldn't be more disappointed. While occasionally this show has some bright spots the rest of it is so contrived and full of horrible acting that it just falls completely flat.

The main gang is a bunch of completely despicable set of human beings except for perhaps one guy but he is so back and forth between complete asshatery and an attempt to do whats right that it makes a mockery of the whole thing. 

The whole show seems to be one pathetically boring attempt to justify showing bikers fighting or blowing things up over and over with little or no purpose other than they are blowing stuff up or fighting.

I started watching this after going through the first three seasons of Justified this crock was recommended based on that show and the two couldn't be any different if they were designed to be. 

Justified was witty and fun while this thing is bogged down in simplistic motivations and violence for the sake of violence.

After 8 episodes of this dreck I am giving up maybe it gets better later on but I am not willing to sit through the pain it would take to get there. I have no idea how this show won any awards. Nor can I figure out how it gets the ratings it does here.

I wanted to like this show but I just cant find anything redeeming in it whatsoever.
