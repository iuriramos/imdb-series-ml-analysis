With a weekly death toll usually reaching 3 figures and at least a couple of gratuitous head mushing incidents an episode this relies heavily on a shock factor to try and raise this above the level of what it actually is, a soap opera. As far as soap goes it's pretty awful, lacking plot and character depth. From the middle aged transvestites, the compulsive masturbating to the racist Nazii's this thing images no effort to disguise the fact that it is a freak show. I watch in the hope of seeing long serving characters die a horrible death as there is not one likable character in the whole show. The small town of Charming is a joke, Walton Goggins in a dress with huge fun bags just about sums this show up.
