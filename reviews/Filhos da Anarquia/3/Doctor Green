Probably one of the most disappointing Shakespearean opportunities to evince itself on the small screen. Such promise and hope from the original scenes of character building moment of episode one. Unfortunately the production turns into samo-samo, American dull cinema. Needs serious examination amongst the brains of the producers.

The best actor is Katey Sagal as the Gertrude character from Hamlet. She's a strong leader, but unfortunately, that's it. Charlie Hunnam, the Geordie, somehow finds a physical demeanour of a 12 year old walking tough on the streets. A little too overacted, and the American accent is too tried. Ron Perlman is the unfortunate leader who withstands the business of dealing with the immature acting and storytelling.
