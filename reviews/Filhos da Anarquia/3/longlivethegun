Who the hell hired that fat dumpy prospect that merely nods his head and offers nothing to the show. Obviously, he has a relative that is affiliated with the show or is owed something by the producers. This is an example of Hollywood nepotism that leaves the audience asking questions that will never be answered. Sometimes, comprimises are made to finish a project, we understand that. But don't make things more confusing because you're lazy. Long live SamCro. Always read the manual. 8 glasses of water a day isn't bad if it contains beer. Measure twice, cut once.

I'm out.
