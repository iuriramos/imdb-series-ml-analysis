I find this show to be hyper-edited; that is, how quickly each shot is cut, so that a conversation is characterized by rapid cuts, each actor saying but a single line before the camera switches to the next actor. Other scenes with fewer such edits have a mildly shaking camera, particularly during tense situations.

The show is highly produced, and the writing immaculate; it is indeed a finely crafted show. Action comes quick, and characters have powerful things to say. The viewer is assaulted by powerful words, aggressively delivered, and intense evolving drama each scene.

To this the editing suits the fast-paced delivery, the frenetic camera-work matching the dizzying story lines and blistering action. It is meticulously crafted, muscular drama.
