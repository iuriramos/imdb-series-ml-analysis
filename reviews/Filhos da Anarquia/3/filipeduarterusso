I really don't understand which great mind decided to ruin this show in its last season. So many ridiculous scenes that the mind boggles. Season 7 is a mix of the 80s Chuck Norris movies and the 2000s B action movies. 

The plot is ridiculous, embarrassing and an insult to viewers intelligence and the show's history. The only good thing is that the final episode of the season finally arrived and it took the cast out of its misery.

PS: the show has very good first few seasons, so if you haven't watch it, you should do it, just keep in mind that you will find a disaster in the final season.
