The first season is okay, after that it goes downhill. The storyline is exactly the same for at least 5 seasons (I stopped at season 5, something I have never done with a series).

It seems to me the writers only wrote 1 season and it just keeps repeating itself. They have tried to raise the gore level/shock effect to compensate for the weak story.

It's a commercial storyline at its worst. To bad for the actors who do a pretty good job in acting (I'd give 7 stars for the actors but then -4 stars for the storyline). There just isn't any honor in acting a story-less series.
