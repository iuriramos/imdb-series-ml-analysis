Wow, season 3 has been totally disappointing. I thought one and two were fairly good although there were many plot holes in the road the SAMCRO were on but season 3 is just horribly written. I predict this is the end of this show. It sadly doesn't have the creativity that shows like the Sopranos and the Wire have given us. Too bad, thought it had some potential. The writers seem to be grasping and straws and have over complicated the issues that face the MC. Not to mention giving them far to easy a way out of every situation, "oh I know, let's just have them suddenly have access to a jumbo jet that doesn't go through any border inspection". Pretty sad writing. They have also had a 101 chances to kill the Mayans, their arch rivals but for some reason they never have the balls to pull the trigger when the chance is there. They also seem to have terrible aim when their target is an actual person. Weird. Ahhhh well, was fun well it lasted.
