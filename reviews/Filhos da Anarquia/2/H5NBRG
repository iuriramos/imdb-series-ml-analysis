I can't believe how this show could ever get a positive review... I haven't watched gay porn, but I'm sure that there's more male hugging going on in this show than in gay porn (not saying that's a bad thing, if you're in to it of course, not trying to offend anyone). 

The story is predictable, characters are the same. You can see everything coming from a mile away. I've not just watched a few episodes, I managed to keep going for the first 2 seasons..since I wanted to give the show a honest chance... And I'm sorry, but this show is just awful. So called ballin bikers.. Terrible! 

I can't understand how this garbage has so many seasons while other good shows have been canceled after just one.
