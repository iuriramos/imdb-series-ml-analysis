If you like to see some kind of justice in a show you watch, don't watch this one. When someone bothers the club, the club kills them. When the police start bothering the club, the club kill the police. If they are threatened to go to jail, they rat and get out of jail. If a rival gang bothers them, they kill the rival gang. They can do all that because they have a magical spell that makes enemy bullets avoid them and their bikes. In 6 seasons the SOA (more like SOB by now) have killed about 100 people. They have lost one guy too. 

I watch every episode hoping at least one of them gets shot and dies, but I'm always left disappointed.
