I hate you, me and everyone remotely connected with this series. I'm ashamed of myself for watching, but it gets two stars for the soap opera like addictive qualities. Not unlike Charlies Angels filming scenes around a single walk, there are entire scenes filmed around a motorcycle ride or worse, a meaningful look from the ever brooding Jacks (Charlie Hunnam) and Tara (Maggie Siff). Add in screaming infants, country music and as close to pornography as they could get and there you have it. Creator Kurt Sutter has said that the series is loosely based on Hamlet; while it's easy to see the characters and plot aspects lifted from Hamlet it digresses into the most base series of torture scenes and cheap sex that you can imagine. If you have a mute button and only need something for background entertainment, go ahead and watch.
