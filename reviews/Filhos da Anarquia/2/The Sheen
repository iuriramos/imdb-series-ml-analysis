This show was promising in the first season, but it quickly showed it's crap colors. As others have said, it's nothing but a soap opera peppered with absolutely asinine scenarios. In this fantasy land, cops don't exist, at least not in the capacity in which they do in the real world. And in this fantasy land, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, is a hyper-dramatic drama queen. Each scene starts with a silent moment where some dumb biker sits there with a contemplative look on their face. The dumb biker is usually surrounded by other dumb people mulling over the dumb biker's latest dramatic dilemma. Like these people have nothing better to do with their lives than sit there and feed the dumb biker's sappy ego.

The show is complete crap. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because a few episodes of the first season showed promise. That quickly faded.
