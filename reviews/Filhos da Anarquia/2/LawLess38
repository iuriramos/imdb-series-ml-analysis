This TV show wasn't that great to begin with. Although, as a comedy it was entertaining. The idea that some broad can run an MC, from the shadows, is ludicrous. This just doesn't happen. This is making itself evident, by the way she (or the writers) is screwing things up with her BS.

So, she gets 'turned out'.....like that never happens in the outlaw world. This has gone from a comedy, to a chick flick soap opera. I'd like to see more on the porn company the 'club' got into. Come on.....how about some babes! How about some action! Currently it is quite pathetic. There are tons of chick shows on TV. this could be better than that. Maybe men (real ones) should write for this show. Get rid of that girlie boy 'Jax' too. If this don't improve....I'm out of here.
