OK, after watching Breaking Bad this one's not going to make it for me. I was hoping to find something exciting and intelligent about the series. Perhaps there's some type of historical reality about the biker life that so many of you love. However, watching a group of psychopathic machismo white men pretend that there "aint" no consequences to completely stupid and and out of control behaviors makes no sense to me. Narcissistic and other personality disordered females with a drug baby with no ethical narrative? Holy f***. These guys operating in a little BFE town would never survive even with some some police corruption. Dozens of dead bikers in a small California town after a gang war would bring the entire nation down on them. It's completely unrealistic. I'm disappointed and was hoping to enjoy watching the entire series on Netflix and FX. Any reframe that would help me to find some value in the series is welcome. And... why is not Ron Perlman at the top of the cast list? And... I love Katy Sagal's work. She's true to her character in spite of the lack of direction of this production.
