I started watching a year ago. I really gave this show a chance, after really annoying, bad written episodes in season 1, but season 2 made it even worse. This is by far on of the worst shows in the last 5 years and I still don't get it how anyone can rate it above a 5 or 6. There are so many logical mistakes, bad acting, "a-team like" shootings from professional killers and bad casting choices. When you reach season 3 and get to Ireland, you won't stop laughing. Sure, some shots made in Ireland are not that cheap but Ireland looks like California - with a blue coloring and every house needs a shamrock painted on a wall.

stop wasting lifetime with sons of anarchy.
