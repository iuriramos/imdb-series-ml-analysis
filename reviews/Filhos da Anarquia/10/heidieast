I am writing this review to let people know that Sons of Anarchy is a well written, well acted, drama. When I first heard people talking about this show "as the best series since the Sopranos". I rolled my eyes...a lot!(I loved the Sopranos and am sick of the comparisons). However from the first episode to the last of season 1, I have become a huge fan. The characters are great and all are portrayed in such a way that you want to learn more about them. Even Tig with his fetishes, and Gemma with her over-the-top, protective, psycho Mom, shtick. You will find yourself wanting to watch more, wrapped up in a "what's going to happen next?" frenzy!!
