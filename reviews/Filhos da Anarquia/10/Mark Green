I just recently finished my 4th re-watched and realized I haven't reviewed it yet! This show starts with such a high octane speed and it hardly ever quits. While it's not exactly the most poetic show, it does manage to let you ponder the meaning of life and which path you really want your life to take. Jax Teller the main protagonist turns from a man wanting to change the direction of his club to a stone cold murderer by the series end.

All of the interaction with the police is a joke and is pretty much everything you'd see out of a Hollywood speed movie. These guys get away with crimes all of the time but each one pays the price from time to time, whether it be through themselves or someone personal to them. Everyone has a weakness on the show, but that doesn't stop it from being highly entertaining with surprises thrown at every turn! One could argue that the show peaked after the Fourth season, but I loved S5 and every season after that. It only gets darker and darker and it hurls towards a unbelievable ending, with our main character having to make the choice of a lifetime and choose which "father" he wants to listen to.

If violence, sexuality, all out slaughter fests and a club full of dead hookers, you might want to avoid this at all costs.
