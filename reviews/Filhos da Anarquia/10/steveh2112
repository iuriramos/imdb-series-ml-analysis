i've loved Sons since the first episode and it continues to get better, now we are close to the end of season 2. the primary story line is the conflict between the original MC club co founder, Clay and the son of the other co-founder Jacks. the conflict is played out perfectly as it grows from episode to episode culminating in , well i don't want to spoil it, but really great writing.

the acting is 100% top notch, Charlie Hunnam is perfect in this roll, Ron Perlman who is not my fav actor from other movies is brilliant, Katey Sagal is awesome and the list just goes on, not a bad roll in the whole show. the only small grip i have is Tommy Flanagan (great acting BTW) who is very obviously Scottish and sounds it, plays an Irish man, which is odd because every thing else in the story line makes sense, why make such an obvious error? Kurt Sutter is a freaking' genius writer to come up with such compelling stories every episode and keep the pace ever building, just like in the Shield which he has now relegated to the second best TV show ever.

i just hope season 3 stays this strong, i'm sure it will and maybe Kurt Sutter need to write a movie, movies seem to suck compared to TV these days.
