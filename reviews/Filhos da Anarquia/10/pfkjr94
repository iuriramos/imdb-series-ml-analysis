Not A lot of people know this but Kurt Sutter the writer and the creator of Sons Of Anarchy Was actually going ahead against another show that HBO was doing about an outlaw motorcycle club and basic cable was able to beat a premium channel.

The is very creative in so many ways there a lot of shows out there about crime and a lot of them don't really hit on the stress that it brings on the criminal's and how they have to deal with it. The character development is incredibly good because The main Character Jax Teller who is played by Charlie Hunman Starts to realized where he at in his life and decides which direction he wants to go with out the help of his family because they think he weak when he wants to the club in legitimate business instead of running guns up the west coast for the IRA.

His Step father Clay Morrow is played by Ron Perlman and I felt he stays evil through the entire series because he old, he has arthritis in his hands, and he used up basically. But since he knows he done soon so he trying to go out with a play and just try and make as much money as he can get his hands no matter what the coast is.

The show will anybody mind
