I did not know who Charlie was until the first episode of "Sons of Anarchy " so I went in blind. What a fantastic surprise to find an actor of Charlie Hunnam's calibre in what I thought would be your basic " biker" show !! He is an awesome talent and deserves and will one day win an Academy Award. I have since discovered he is an awesome human being period as is Charlie's long time beautiful lady Morgana McNeils, a jewellery designer in LA. Both are down to earth people who shun the glitz of Hollywood preferring to do their own thing. Charlie is very very aware of how much his fans love and follow him and does his best to give his fans time for autographs and photo ops no matter how busy he is or what physical condition he may be due to the rigorous time schedule he follows. Charlie is definitely destined to be THE BEST STAR OF HIS GENERATION bar NONE!! We love you Charlie and respect your privacy! Please keep up the excellent work which you do for all the world to see! May you and your lovely lady Morgana have a long happy life together Charlie!
