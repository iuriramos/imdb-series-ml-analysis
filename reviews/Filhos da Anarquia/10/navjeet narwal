this is the best TV show i have ever seen all the characters are very brilliantly written and beautifully performed with the story and twists and action and love politics........there is not another better than this i have ever seen and i have seen lots it satisfies all your needs in an entertainment.... the only cons is you cant skip any episode better than vampire diaries, breaking bad, etc its not about a single person ,it's a story of club and all the peoples related to them. this show teaches you about brotherhood, trust, importance of family. it's just simply excellent and brilliant. and definitely recommend it for season lovers.
