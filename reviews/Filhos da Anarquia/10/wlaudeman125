I went into this show thinking it would be another decent action show that would fail after 2 seasons, after a few episodes though, my mind was very pleasantly changed. This show is as entertaining and deep as the shield or the sopranos, it bears many resemblances to Hamlet and is obviously based on the Hells Angels. It has deep interesting plots that really pull you into the story, the acting and character development is so deep and incredible that you can relate to the characters, fear for them, hope for them and worry about them. the writing is great as well, great dialogue, interesting stories, and surprisingly realistic. it is also smart, something rare in todays reality TV and soap operas, with intricate stories that aren't just senseless violence, not that there is no violence. it has been called the sopranos on motorcycles, but i think the sopranos should be called SoA with more Italians. With the new episodes coming out i'm really excited for the season finale, Donna is dead, Abel came home, jax slept with his ex and all in one episode. Cant wait for the season finale, then i wont be able to wait for season 2. This is an incredible show that really stands out, and it would be a serious injustice to be canceled. If you have yet to witness SAMCROW i highly advise you check it out, all the episodes are on hulu.com, if you've seen it and loved it like me, support it by watching all the new episodes and buying the DVDs when they come out(cant wait) and if you don't like, well you can go back to your mindless reality TV and soap operas.
