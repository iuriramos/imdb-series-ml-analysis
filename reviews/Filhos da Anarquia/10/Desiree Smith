I think this is the best TV series ever, they show us lot of trust,love and anger. Hope we could see more of Charlie Hunnman in the future. Also miss the other good actors. Would love a new sons of anarchy season but it sad that s7 was the last one. Everyone that love Dexter, Breaking bad and The walking dead would love this show! The show have a lot of drama and action. It is hard to only watch one episode on a day, i watched 3pr day and sometimes 4 until it was finish. We need more series like this, it not often you could find a solid TV series like this! Good actors, funny persons and every man in the club have a nice personality. The series cover everything like shooting, family life, club related things, deals, criminality and it is very exciting!
