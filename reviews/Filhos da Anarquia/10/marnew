I hadn't seen Sons of Anarchy and so many of my friends had. I sort of felt like I'd been left out of the loop so last month I started at the beginning and I must caution you that if you don't want to be addicted, don't watch this series. I've made it through the 4th season right now and it's like I have a person connection with all the characters. The writing is excellent and the depth of each individual is marvelous. I had spent time in youth with a friend of motorcycle club and had a great time. I think this is a good represntation of the type of lifestyle that happens. It is a very good show! I would recommend this series to anyone. Anyone that is who doesn't mind becoming addicted. I can't wait to see the next season, but I'm not sure if it is out yet.
