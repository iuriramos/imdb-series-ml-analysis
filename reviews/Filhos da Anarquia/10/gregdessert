Online reviews are promising at first, but quickly show their crap colors. As many have said, they are nothing but trolls with absolutely asinine things to say. In this fantasy land, any fat nerd up at 2am in between porn masturbation sessions, has something insightful to say; at least in the capacity that their hot pocket and red bull-driven insecure rants will allow. And in this fantasy, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE could care less about what your ridiculous opinion is. Each review starts with some dumb troll saying something dumb, while other dumb trolls agree with what the original dumb troll said, because dumb trolls all like to be publicly negative together instead of just focus on what they DO like rather than what they DON'T like. Like these people have nothing better to do with their lives than to sit there and talk crap on a show beloved by millions of people because their lives are so miserable? Sons of Anarchy is amazing, get into it.
