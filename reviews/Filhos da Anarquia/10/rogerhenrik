This series is very, very good! I see that some people think otherwise. For instance one guy who writes in the review that they got their bikes with them to Ireland....hmmm....well.....in the episode I watched the head of the Irish bikers said that they were gonna fix them some rides when they got there....or maybe I'm wrong....don't think so, though.The same guy wrote in his review that they didn't have their passports....strange....if you LOOK you clearly see them show their passports when they are stopped on the road in Ireland! I wish people have all the facts before just writing. Good actors, well written. At the end of each episode you just want to continue watching more. Well, of course everybody don't like to watch the same type of TV-series, but some people writing here have watched two or three seasons and think it's not for them.....but....why watch all those episodes if you don't like it? ..... I've started watching series and maybe after the first or second episode I realized that I didn't want to continue watching, so I stopped. I think this is great! Quite funny also, sometimes.
