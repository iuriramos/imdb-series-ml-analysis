You will hear lots of good and lots of bad about this show, just as you do with any show. However I personally love this show and think it is by far one of the best shows I have watched. I loved Dexter, Breaking Bad, The Shield, NCIS, Law & Order Special Victims Unit and many others, but this show is more nail-biting and extreme than anything else I have watched. Love it or hate it a lot of people still talk about it which makes it one of the best shows on T.V. today. I hope my review helps you consider watching and season 7, which is the last season, will be EPIC! If you have not yet seen the show please take the time to at least watch a few episodes as some people might think it starts out a little slow where others will think it starts out with a bang.
