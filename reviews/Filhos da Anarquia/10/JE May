When I started this series, I was expecting a cheesy biker show. Boy, was I ever wrong. 1) The acting is phenomenal. These high-caliber actors are so believable as grungy bikers, I had to double check their backgrounds myself. The cast is comprised of very well-trained actors who take their craft seriously, and their dedication truly reflects on screen. 2) The writing is extremely compelling. Every season not only has depth & complexity to the story lines, but all have jaw-dropping season finales that leave you wanting more. The mafia-like lifestyle portrayed is intriguing, as you have violent criminals who will go to any lengths to protect their families & club. There is love and spite, tenderness and toughness, humor and horror, loyalty and betrayal, and endless twists, turns and surprises--creating a very well-rounded series. Great job SOA crew, look forward to more entertainment to come!
