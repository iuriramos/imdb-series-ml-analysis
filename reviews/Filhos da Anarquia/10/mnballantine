Kurt Sutter kept you on your toes throughout this entire series. Throwing in curve balls and heart wrenching moments. Definitely a show I would own, re-watch and recommend to friends. The acting was phenomenal throughout the entire show. The connections made with the characters within the show and just how the actors interacted behind the scenes really set off the chemistry for the show. The writing and dialogue set up for the show was very professional and non-repetitive. Again the show character and emotions were excellent and the casting was spot on in filling all the roles. So sad to see the series end but it made a full circle and closed beautifully.
