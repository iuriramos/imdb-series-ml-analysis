SOA is the best show on t.v. period. The show keeps you on the edge of your seat! The show is pretty realistic too. My husband and I are into motorcycle gangs and love watch documentaries about them and this show stays true to club roots. You can never predict what is going to happen next because the show always takes does a 180 and people you don't expect to die, leave or turn do and thats what makes the show so good. The actors are perfect, not one person on the show seems fake or has bad acting. The scenes are intense and believable. I LOVE this show and I try and turn as many people as I can to it. I'm going to buy all the seasons on DVD so when my son gets older he can watch them because I guarantee this show will go down in history. It's just a awesome show and I haven't yet to meet a person who doesn't like it.
