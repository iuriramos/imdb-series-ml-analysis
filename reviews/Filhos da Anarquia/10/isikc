Rate this show. It easily and most certainly deserves a 10 star rating. It's one of the best action and drama series ever made. It's both action packed and full of emotion at times. It pumps adrenaline and pushes you to the core of action head-on, then smacks you with great moments of drama in the face. It is that powerful. The show's cast is tremendous. All actors and actresses are great including main and supporting roles. The music tracks used in the show whether it is an action scene or a scene that shows our outlaw-biker friends slowly moving into the sunset, are marvelous. The hard rock tunes accompany the soul of this show perfectly. This show will make you addicted once you click play and leave you craving for more. The first season was awesome and the second season was more awesome if that is possible. The only thing I can complain about is the length of the seasons. 13 episodes is far away from being enough. It won't sustain your desire to hear the rumbling and roaring of the Harley bikes. Second season is over and sadly we have to wait over nine months to greet season 3 but heyy!!, The SONS answer to no one...CHEERS!!
