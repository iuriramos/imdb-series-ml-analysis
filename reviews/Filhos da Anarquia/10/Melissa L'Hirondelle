The depth of each character of the MC unfolds with each episode, even now in the sixth season. You feel the struggle each one faces, and you either empathize with them, criticize them or ostracize them. The grittiness, raw emotion and overall amplified rush will have your lust and complete devotion. You will continue to be rooting for the antagonists in this show!

At times, it jaw-dropping, heart-wrenching and undeath defying. If you have loved older shows such as the Wire, and The Shield then you shouldn't miss Sons of Anarchy. It is already said to live to at least 8 seasons. Don't miss out!
