I actually love sons of anarchy literally it's been five days and I'm onto season 7 it's so addictive!! All the episodes are so believable and interesting it doesn't leave anything to the imagination when it comes to violence and everything is so well thought out it's so entertaining to watch and see the different sides of the characters. I absolutely love Chibs & Tigs and obviously Jax the big hunk, the cast are so believable and all play there roles so well. This is definitely one of my favourite programmes I really thought I wouldn't like it but I am hooked it really is pure entertainment and leaves you hanging onto the end of your seat after every episode! I LOVE IT. Everyone should watch sons of anarchy you will not regret it.
