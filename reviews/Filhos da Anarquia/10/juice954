Every episode is packed full of brutal action that does not hold back at all. The casting done on this show is phenomenal, the main character Jax is spectacular and when watching the show its impossible not to root for him in every episode, he is a perfect symmetry of hardcore bad ass and caring friend. The show is one of my favorite shows on television if not my favorite by far. If you like brutal action or your into outlaw motorcycle clubs you will be in heaven watching this show, but i would recommend this show to anyone honestly. Its an easy 10/10 for me and I am curious why more people haven't rated this show. If you haven't seen this show at least give it a try, i guarantee after one episode you will be hooked.
