This series is as good as The Shield and Sopranos was, which for me means it is as good as it gets.

It is fun and mature action packed Drama and the storyline is just perfect! I do not understand why it is not even more popular than what it seem to be.

If you like Dexter, Prison break, Carnival, Oz and other such great series you will also love this one.

The whole thing is a kind of harsh and epic story about an Outlaw brotherhood unfolding and the depth of the characters, even the ones which are unsympathetic, are what really keeps the series going. 

I hope we get at least 4 seasons of this future classic!

10/10
