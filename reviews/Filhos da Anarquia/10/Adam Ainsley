This show has everything you would want from good TV; great writing, interesting and complex characters and enough complex plot twists to satisfy even the most attentive viewer. This show is incredibly complex and complicated, but doesn't leave to many plot threads to tie up. Each season is it's own tale, with the same characters and a large inter- twining story tying them all together. For example, Season 3 is about Abel's kidnapping and Season 4 is about the new agent trying to shut down the sons. The show is very violent and is not for the squeamish. It freely shows graphic shootings, stabbings and torture. If you're okay with all of these things it's a great, morally ambiguous tale of bikes and blood.
