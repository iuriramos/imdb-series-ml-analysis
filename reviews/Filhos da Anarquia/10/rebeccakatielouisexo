Where to begin? I started watching this, after getting together with my partner, as he had previously been into it. And since that moment from watching the first season, we've seen the whole series, several times online.

The writing behind the show, is so good. It's around a pretty cool subject, of Harley Davidsons! And has paired it with great actors. And Tommy Flanagan's Scottish accent is to die for as Chibs.

It does have a lot of violence in!, but that coupled with character development, is a to die for combination.
