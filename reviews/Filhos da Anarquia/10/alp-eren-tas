SOA was in my watch-list more than one year and I was afraid of to start a new TV series which is needed to spend time for it. Eventually ,I said to myself; Screw it! i am starting and I am overly glad that I started . SOA is unique program in its own way. I wanna point out a few things which cause me to attached to SOA. 1- Incredibly excellent acting.Every main characters have a specific personality. And you can describe all of the crew's behavior , personalities. 2- Phenomenal ,Magnificient Soundtracks. I gotta tell you they have the best soundtracks ever If think the whole soundtracks. You can listen every one of them again and again. Keep watching it. YEAY...
