In my decades of TV and movie watching I've come to use a particular phrase far too often: "Well it's not Shakespeare but at least it was entertaining." It's kind of my go-to summary of routine stuff that is fun to watch but isn't really ground breaking. Of course there's better and worse but that one phrase is (for me) adequate enough to describe the bulk of OK shows that come and go.

I'm happy to say I can't use that phrase here. Instead I get to say: Sons of Anarchy is Shakespeare.

This is a show I started watching with no expectations. What I ended up with was a thrill ride of drama, action and dark comedy.

Whether you like the idea of a story about bikers or not, set aside any hesitation and at least give it a chance. This does not glorify the outlaw lifestyle or encourage people to break the law. It just lays out an epic tale of family, friendship, betrayal and brotherhood in all of its glorious and more frequently tragic circumstance.

There is a connection here to the core of human relationships that is rarely portrayed in any format of entertainment; and while you may not always agree with the choices someone makes, you can't help but feel their pain while considering what it would be like in their shoes to be forced into making those choices.

Shakespeare has far and long been considered a master of storytelling. All I can say is the writers have learned from him and infused that same level of craftsmanship into a masterwork of drama that pulls at the very heart of man.

Beyond the story, every aspect of this show is also well done. The acting quality from some of the leads is among the best ever put on film. Even the secondary talent brings a level of realism and believability that suits what is needed for their character. The casting was simply spot on and leaves no room for improvement.

The sets, costumes and cinematography are all also suitable for what needs to be portrayed. This isn't a big budget sci-fi with a bunch of expensive special effects, its the nit and grit of the real world we all live in and it's shown in all of its dirt and glory.

In 40+ years of watching TV and movies; I'm honestly at a loss to name a single thing I've ever watched that was better written or acted than Sons of Anarchy.

There are a few things that come close, and to be honest there are things I'd rather watch more often on repeats simply because they are more fun or more in line with my daily tastes. But, as a total experience Sons of Anarchy is a must watch, at least once in your lifetime. It's just that good.
