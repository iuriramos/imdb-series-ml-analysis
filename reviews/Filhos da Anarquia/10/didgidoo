we love sons of anarchy,and watch it wivout fail every week.always rush back if we are out so not to miss it.actors are brilliant,story line is believable and keeps you on the edge of your seat!they've made it so realistic,you'd think it was a real club.we are huge fans of s.o.a.brought loads of stuff like keyrings etc. brought s.o.a hoodies and me and a friend went to a general bike meet place.as soon as we arrived,there was another bike club there and two of the members said:"should be burnt".don't know whether he was referring to us or the hoodies!! anyway,don't people know its only a fictistious t.v programme?!
