Charming in a small fictional town in Northern California in the United States, inhabits the club bikers Sons of Anarchy. The group deals with illicit activities such as drug trafficking and porn films and is led by Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman) and Jax Teller (Charlie Hunnam). Besides the effort to reconcile their employment with family and children, you have to live with their different opinions: while Morrow opts for violent tradition, Teller is inspired by the revolutionary rhetoric of the daily of his late father.

One of the best series of all time, early action to an end, simply indescribable!

Nothing I try to write about this series will measure how is a fantastic series, the first episodes you did not feel so much enthusiasm, but after about 10 episodes, you felt as if made part of it, really deserves to be in first place in the ranking of best series of all time!
