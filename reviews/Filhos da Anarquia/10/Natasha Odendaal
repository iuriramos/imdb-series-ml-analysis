I have to say, when I heard about Sons of Anarchy..... I thought..... Hhow can a bike series be good blah blah. Out of boredom I decided to take a peak..... Well guess what... I couldn't stop watching;-)

Season 6 finally.....what a sad tear shedding moment I had...... So disappointed in Juice....I kind of hate him right now...... Wish Gemma could be ran over..... Got absolutely NO love for that woman!!!! So proud of Jax and his crew! I grew so close to the Sons of Anarchy.... Its one awesome series and very sad that it is coming close to an end! Will sure miss you all a lot!!!

I will just have to watch it over....... ;-)

Keep up the good work guys.... My Gemma and Juice get what they deserve in Season 7! Can't wait to see what the S.0.A is up to
