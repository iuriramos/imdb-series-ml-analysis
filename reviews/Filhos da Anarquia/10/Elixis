I rarely give something a full star rating, but this one deserves it. Last thing I would want is let yet another show get thrown off the air due to ratings. So many networks fail to realize that shows take awhile to get popular and many people download shows in order to watch them when they can, causing low ratings and cancellations to good shows. Well I would be sad to see that happen to Sons of Anarchy. Unfortunately I live in Canada so we only have Season 1 right now and I am forced to download Season 2 as our networks haven't even started them. But I will contribute to the show by getting Season 2 once it's on shelves, and if it means watching it on TV when aired to help I will. Word of mouth is a powerful thing and with Facebook and social networking, i'll do what I can to keep the show running. 

People already covered all the fantastic aspects of the show. Those 2 that had the lowest, did not watch it far enough to even merit understanding to the crappy comments they had. If you are on this site to look at the rating, curious if it's worthy, all I can say is give it a shot, because it sure is!! 

As a girl, I am not usually into "biker shows" so much, in fact I started watching it because others were and i had nothing else to do. I watched all of the Season 1 box set in 2 evenings. That's how good of a show it is. I never expected it to be that good. 

Watch it for yourself. I highly recommend this series to anyone. "Biker" or not.
