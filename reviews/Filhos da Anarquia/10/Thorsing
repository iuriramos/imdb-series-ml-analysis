This series is one of the most brilliant of all time. It has a different angle that one does not find in other series. The story and the way it has developed through these first 5 seasons is incredibly intriguing and it is clear that Kurt Sutter has put some real thought into this.

The acting is terrific. Everybody does a fantastic job and they work extremely good together.

I will stop here due to the fact that I have nothing bad to say about this show. If you're reading this - WATCH THIS SHOW! I promise that you will not regret it.

Those who rated this less than 7 has absolutely no understanding of what a series should be like. Or perhaps it is the same ones that rated the shows, which spoon-feeds people without making the viewers think for themselves.
