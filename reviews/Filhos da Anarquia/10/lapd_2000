I DVR'd SOA and I forgot I had it saved. I finally watched the 1st episode last week and I was hooked 5 minutes in. The show is a mix of The Sopranos and The Shield. The acting is top notch and as others have said, you find yourself rooting for the "bad guys" just like The Shield and The Sopranos. How cool is it seeing "Peggy Bundy" in a hardcore role? I also like the way there are several story lines developing, which allows you to attach yourself to several characters. I am anxiously awaiting season 2. My only fear is they may have gone to deep too quick, with lines in the club apparently being drawn with Jax & Piney vs. Clay, Tig and the hardcore members. But we'll see.Bring on season 2.
