My uncle rode with the Hell's Angels, and I remember some of the stuff he used to tell me. This show is very accurate from that perspective. I really enjoyed from start to finish. It was nice to see how the characters changed and became their own during the series. 

I was totally bummed out though when one of the main characters was killed in jail. He was my favorite!!

I am ready for the spin offs from Kurt Sutter. He really knows how to make TV.

I found many Hamlet references, and that plays out in the end. I think they could have done a few more seasons. The show was just too exciting to end.
