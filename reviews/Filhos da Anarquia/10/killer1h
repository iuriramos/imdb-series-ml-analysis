This show is the embodiment of what being in a real biker gang(despite the legal ramifications) is all about. It's got drama that really might happened to a biker gang, guns, drugs, and deals with local gangs. All these elements seem to give a sense of authenticity and zeal.

Now onto the actual plot, Jax the "VP" of the club has discovered his dead fathers journals in his old things, now up to this point he had been led to believe that his father went along with all the gunrunning and shady dealings that the club has been doing, although his journal seems to suggest something entirely different. In the meantime we have Gemma(jax's mother) trying desperately to cover this truth up to what end we don't know yet. Clay (the clubs "Prez") has assumed the role of jax's father-figure and seems to have his own ideas about the way the club should be going. There's also a few more characters to take note of like Tara (jax's love interest) and Opie (jax's best friend), but all and all a very well written out story and plot hats off to Kurt Sutter for creating yet another brilliant series. Keep'em coming we love it!
