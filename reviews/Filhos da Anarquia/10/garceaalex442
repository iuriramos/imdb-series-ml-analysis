This show is one of the best I've seen(if not the best) and trust me, I've seen a lot. This show has everything you need:action,comedy,romance,crime,mystery,shootouts.. It's a show that you won't be able to forget and you're gonna love the characters ! This show is about a motorcycle club, a "gang" of outlaws, that runs the streets of Charming. They value very much loyalty and friendship and maybe that's the reason why I love it so much. The main character's name is Jackson "Jax" Teller and he's the Vice-President of SAMCRO(Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original) Charter. SAMCRO is the original charter of SoA and it originally contained 9 members, whom were called the "First 9". Among them were John Teller,the dead father of Jax, Clarence "Clay" Morrow,the actual President of the club and Jax's step-father. Clay married to Jax's mother, Gemma , not long after John Teller's death. The original charter was formed in Redwood County,Minnesota, therefor stands the name "Redwood Original".
