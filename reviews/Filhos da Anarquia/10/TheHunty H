When I first started watching sons of anarchy, after 3 episodes I almost quit. But then the plot intensified and I was on the edge of my seat. In season three up to episode 7 I also almost quit. But the finale was so good It made the whole season fantastic. The whole show fantastic. I realised then that Sons Of Anarchy has a slow start in every season, but the ending is so good it makes the whole series is fantastic. I can only compare it to the satisfaction felt once completing a jigsaw :) The more you continue to watch this TV series the more you will like it. It has also changed my music taste with the great music involved. I have one recommendation. Always continue watching!
