My friend suggests me to watch this, at first I don't know what kind of show this is, but when I started watching, this show is totally an epic one. What an acting, what a thinking of the Hero. Liked every bit of it.

This show is also very helpful for me in my life, not that I am in this kind of business, but I have a rough life and I wanted to do the things right. Jackson Teller is my inspiration, I learned many things from him.

In the end, I would highly recommend this show if you have done such things in your life that you don't have to do and you wanted it to be right, then I guess this show is for you, showing you the life.
