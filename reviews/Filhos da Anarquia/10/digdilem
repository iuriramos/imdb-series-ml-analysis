Superb musical montages which tell as much of the story as the rest. Good and detailed plot, tightly scripted and well acted. Directed and edited to perfection.

Manages to capture what feels like a very real sense of brotherhood and what it means to be a man in a hostile world, yet remembers to include the women and their role too.

Avoid if you don't specifically want to see gore, a bit of female flesh and drug use. If you can accept that as part of the plot and appreciate quality TV, you gotta watch it and give it your full attention.

Great story told well. Can only think of a few TV drama series that are on a par with this.
