When Jax popped Alice it was the best single bullet discharged ever. The off-shoots that this show takes only adds to how much this show impacts every aspect of everyones lives. People think it only about bikers and the crimes they commit, but it is so much more. There are so many incredible actors involved in this show, you just can't help like this show. Jimmey Smits, Maggie Siff, Ron Perlman, and Katey Sagal are all standouts. When you have premium actors lining up to have guest appearances on this show says a lot. The suspense of the show has developed into an incredible foray of suspense. Goggins is such an awesome actor. The Shield, Justified, and SOA proves he needs an Emmy!
