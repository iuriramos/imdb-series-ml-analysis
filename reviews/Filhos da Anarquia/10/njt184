I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. It had been recommended by a couple of people so I decided to give it a go.

FX have an absolute diamond of a show on their hands. It is superb

The writing is fantastic and the casting is spot on. The plots are intricate and well thought out and the characters are developed to perfection.

I was sceptical of Hunnam's ability to pull off an American accent (his cockney one in Green Street Hooligan's was painful) but he nailed it. Katey Sagal absolutely owns the role of powerful matriarch. Kurt Sutter is a genius!
