I was very intrigued by the title of this series. Sons of ANarchy is a very stylish name. Add badass harleys to the mix and you have got a great way to lure the viewers. But to sustain the viewership the show needs to be irresistible. Sons of Anarchy has all that and more going for it. The acting is top notch. You can actually feel his emotions on his face. The series reminds me of the wild west where revenge and killing ruled over the law. The series has politics, team work, manipulations, deaths, gore and most of all the wonderful recurring sounds and sights of bunch of harleys. Addictive and awesome. After Dexter and Game of Thrones, this is my newest addiction. Double thumbs up
