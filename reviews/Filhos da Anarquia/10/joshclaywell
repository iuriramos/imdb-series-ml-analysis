I started Sons of Anarchy not really knowing what to expect, except for what my dad -- who's in a Christian MC -- and several friends told me. They thought I would love the show, but I was skeptical. I watched the first episode, but fell asleep -- so I gave it a shot again a few days later.

This time, I was hooked. I watched the first season in a week, then breezed through the second in just a few days during a snowstorm. Everyone who told me I'd love the show was right. This show had me. I couldn't get enough of it.

I got to Season 7 -- the final one -- and decided to take my time with it, to really try and savor every minute of the show. I finished it just a few nights ago, and the finale blew me away. The scene with Jax, Abel, Thomas and Wendy were incredibly powerful, and the imagery throughout the episode -- the bread and wine and the angel of death Jax encounters at the courthouse -- made it even better. What an ending, too, with Jax's final ride.

I highly recommend this show to anyone and everyone.
