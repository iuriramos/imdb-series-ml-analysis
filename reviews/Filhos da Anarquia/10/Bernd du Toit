SPOILER ALERT!!!! Season 1 up until Season 7 was a breathtaking experience for me. The CGI was perhaps cheap but that doesn't matter.

The pilot episode in SoA already hyped me up, that doesn't happen a lot in the first episodes in TV shows. Jax finds his father's journal and then wants to head in the same direction his father went. This is the case in Season 1 up to Season 3. Jax is the Vice President of the club from Season 1 till Season 4, from Season 5 till Season 7 he's the President of the club until his death in the finale of Season 7.

His mother Gemma has manipulated the club at many moments. She got what she deserved late in Season 7.

There is a lot of action and violence, and here and there humour.
