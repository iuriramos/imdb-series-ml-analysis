Great show in which you get attached to the characters. It's dark and gritty in places and funny in other places. Makes you want to go out and get a Harley and a cut! The first series takes some time to get going but once you're in you cant stop watching. Some characters hang around a little too long. The final series is barbaric and a little unbelievable for the first few episodes but once you understand where Jax is taking the club it becomes really watchable. There are some cheesy scenes and the car/bike chase bits could be a little more original but otherwise its a great watch. Hopefully there will be a prequel.
