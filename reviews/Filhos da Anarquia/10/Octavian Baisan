Do you know those series that start out so confident and they really catch you up so hard that you HAVE to watch it ? But at 1 point you get disappointed, cause they start throwing scenes/episode so they just keep the series on air ? Well i have some news for you, this is not that type of series. This is the type that just gets better and better with each episode/season. Whats the key of this movie ? IT'S UNPREDICTABLE. You just cant figure the plot out, or if you do at 1 point it just turns. I m a big fan of quality movies/series. This is one that you should check on you re watch list. The 8.7 rating is so irrelevant, its at least a 9, id give it at 9.4, lacks some actions here and there. OVERALL : GREAT SERIES, its the kind of thing done when you put you re heart to it and it just cant turn out bad. PS Ron Pearlman's acting makes you feel sometimes like you re a part of SAMCRO.
