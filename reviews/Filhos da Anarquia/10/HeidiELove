The lives of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club are explored in Kurt Sutter's Drama.

This is one of the finest shows on Television. Trade press has labeled this "'Easy Rider' Meets 'The Sopranos".

There are not very many TV series on earth that have exploded onto the scene with such a rich display of heart wrenching dramatic stories and inherently interesting characters. I flew through the first 3 Seasons of these burly bikers and went through all different types of emotions- Darkness, regret, longing, desperation and the family value it emulates. A lot of Actresses complain about TV/Film being a man's world..But Katy Segal is more than breathtaking taking on so many roles - as an audience you either love her or despise her to bits. IT's about family, her family and absolutely nothing will get in the way of what she wants to inevitably hold this Club together. Even if it means doing the most awful despising things to shelter them all.
