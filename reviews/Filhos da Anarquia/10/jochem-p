This is by far the best show I have watched in my life. Excellent actors and from the first second you are drawn into the crazy world of Charming. The road takes very drastic plot changes during the show which no one saw coming.

I have never experienced a show with more excitement in it in all of the episodes. You feel one with all the characters of the show and especially Jax of course. That makes it so hard you see him getting in deeper and deeper until there is no way back. The finale was thrilling, great ending..

Kurt Sutter, you made one hell of a show there. Loved it, every bit!!
