A friend recommanded me this show and when he told me about it I wasn't really impressed but after some time I finally decided to give it a try. After the 3rd episode I was obsessed, it's a great story and it really made me change my point of view in a few areas. I just love how to show is directed and that by the end of one episode you can't wait to see the next one, that why I finished the entire show in just 4 weeks. 

I was a little disappointed on the ending, but I guess that's how it was supposed to happen.

I totally recommend this show for everyone who wants to see a very interesting story, with excellent actors and unexpected twist.
