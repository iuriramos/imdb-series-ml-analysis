If I could give this TV series more than a 10 star rating, I would have. This is the most brilliantly written show that I have ever watched. The characters are intriguing, and always leaving you with the ache of wanting more. It is very violent and graphic, but also shows the love of those they call family. So much drama goes on throughout the seasons that you have to know what comes next. The storyline revolves around Jaxon Teller, (who by the way, is the sexiest man on earth), and his need to learn about the history of the motorcycle club and to help with guiding it's future. There are so many times that you will either want to cry or throw something at the TV screen, which goes to show how brilliant Kurt Sutter is with his writing. I highly recommend this show!!
