Just watched the series finale and I'm trying to write this while sobbing like a child, fingers and hands trembling, how do you even recover from this?!?!.. How do you even recover from the deep impact that this "most devastating and cruel show of all time" has left on you?!?! For 7 years, sometimes for an hour, sometimes for an hour and a half, the genius Kurt Sutter and the gang have managed to make us forget and replace all our real worries and troubles with that of Tellers' and the Club's, what do you fill that void with now?! Great, great actors graced our screens every week with their coolest and most charismatic presence, and made us passionately care for the realistic characters they brought to life, cheer with them during their very rare happy moments, or feel their pain and shed tears, or mourn their brutal, violent, unjust deaths, whether likable or not.. Mostly being anger and frustration, we went through all kinds of emotions during every single hour - we laughed, we cried, we screamed, we cursed, we even threw things at our screens, peeked through our fingers during violent and brutal scenes.. From start to her death at the end of season 6, I could never wrap my head around people's absolute and kind of blind love and support for the character of Tara when, to me, she was one of the worst and most annoying characters in all TV history but that showed me how most people were unwilling to look at things from different points of view and see things from different perspectives and would choose to fixate on one (and that being "a mother"s perspective in Tara/Gemma battle).. I was furious when the show took the path which ended with Gemma killing Tara and made me question how much a person can do wrong with the best of intentions.. But all that is over now and I am feeling truly, genuinely sad about that right now. Thinking how much I was invested in this show is blowing my mind, I can't type any longer so I'm just taking a bow to you, folks. THANK YOU.
