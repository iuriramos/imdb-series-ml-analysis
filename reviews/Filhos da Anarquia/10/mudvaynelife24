I've read that some people may be thinking that this shows characters treatment of women is so bad that its unrealistic. If you still believe that, then get on Netflix or however you can watch shows, look for Gangland and watch every episode about Biker Gangs. The men in Biker Gangs treat women like second class citizens. They don't respect them. If you're a woman and you want to be in a Biker Gang, you are open season to any member of the gang. You will be involved in prostitution. There's no respect. Until you become an old lady, you are nothing. So how these characters treat these women is realistic. The creator of the show spent time with the Hells Angels for research and one of the actors on the show is a real Hells Angel, if he's still around and involved, then the show is realistic. I'll admit that while I liked the first season, it was weak in some points. But don't give up. Keep watching. It picks up in season 2 and in season 3, the storytelling is exceptional. When you get to the end of season 3, you will be shocked. Season 4 leaves you in such suspense that you want to raid FX Studios and force them to start season 5 right then and there. Just keep watching. I guarantee that it gets so much better.
