I love this show... been a faithful follower from day one... reminds me of some very good friends of mine where i'm from!!The twists and turns in the plot make M. Night Shamalyan (sp) look like an amateur, and the depth of the characters give the viewer a familial feel! It's as if you know each one of them personally! Each episode is filled with mystery. Sad to see Hale get murdered and just amazing to see Stephen King of all people as a guest star. It's as if the show has received his stamp of approval! Looking forward with anticipation to the remainder of the season! Gemma Teller is my personal favorite character, filled with passion and determination! Kudos to Kurt Sutter, his lovely wife Katey Segal, and the rest of the crew!! And since no one rated the show, I gave it the first 10 stars, so there!!!:-) much love SOA View Crew solitary :-)
