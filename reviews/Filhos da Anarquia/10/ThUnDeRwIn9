Where do I start with Sons of Anarchy? I was a little late to this party as I started watching when it finished. It has since become one of my favourite shows. Sons of Anarchy follows a gang of bikers in fictional Charming, California. Shows the inner workings of the Motorcycle Club - The Sons Of Anarchy, and ran for 7 seasons. The show is full of sympathetic characters. We learn from the get go, that these characters are lawless and reckless. Yet somehow I found an affinity with many of them. The music in sons of Anarchy is amazing. A band called the Forest Rangers do covers of many great songs especially for sons, it really helps drive the story and emotions home. The acting is great, Charlie Hunnam is likable for an anti-hero and both Ron Perlman and Katey Segal are perfect for their characters. You will love some of them and hate some of them in equal measures. All in all, this is an amazing show and comes highly recommended. Well worthy of a binge. 10/10. :)
