Sons of Anarchy is an absolutely amazing series. Everyone who had negative things to say about this, definitely had not seen past season 1, because I must admit Charlie Hunam clearly had not mastered the true American accent and the story line wasn't the best at times. But even so season one being only a decent first series, the rest of this show surely got me hooked... It's appropriately violent, dark in places, funny with a few light hearted moments and overall brilliantly diverse. Another thing that really surprised me about this was, it wasn't just about white trash bikers (as someone may assume) it's a quality drama with complex female characters. In my opinion there was no-one better suited for Gemma and Tara then Katey Sagal and Maggie Siff who pottery they're roles beautifully as well as the rest of the cast.

Overall this is a great series. I have been hooked on and seen a lot of other great series like breaking bad and the walking dead; but they're just not as good as SOA.

10/10
