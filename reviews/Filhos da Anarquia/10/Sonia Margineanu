I've started watching SOA a couple weeks ago and 2 days ago I've finished it. It kept me glued to my laptop for weeks in a row. The way the story is told by Kurt is simply amazing. It's true there are some uncomfortable scenes within this show but those only make it more viable and real. The actors are all perfectly chosen for the job. They are all so natural in doing what their characters are supposed to do that is almost scary :)) Nobody can be that good of a player. Jax is by far my favorite character not only for his looks (Charlie Hunnam is indeed gorgeous) but for the life of his character. Born in this life he cannot escape from. I truly am amazed of what he does in the end..of what becomes of his family and club. Another great aspect of this show is the music. I love it! The white buffalo fits perfectly and it gives the show a certain feel i will truly miss. Sons of Anarchy..it was such a great ride and i will miss watching it.
