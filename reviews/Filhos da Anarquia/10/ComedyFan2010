To me this show was perfect from the beginning until the end. Not everyone will agree with me. But I guess I saw what the creator of the show wanted to give us. I was interested for the first 3 seasons, i the 4th one I became completely hooked. And while the beginning of the 7th seemed a bit less good than the rest, the finale of it made it all make sense. It is one of the few shows where the ending is perfect even if not everything ended the way I wish it would, but it made perfect sense.

Every season has a main story through which the club goes. And it is usually very entertaining. We get a lot of twists and surprises. And even things that we can predict manage to make one gasp.

It is absolutely beautiful. Don't get me wrong, it has a lot of violence and some parts can be so gruesome that one has to look away. But when it comes to character developments the show is definitely on the high level.

The actors are all very well casted and do a perfect work. At first I didn't like Charlie Hunnam very much. Mainly because off his ridiculous way to walk, I thought it was him overacting. But luckily he turned it down a bit and as I found it out it was his natural way of walking, go figure!.

Katey Sagal is perfect in her role as Gemma. This is an amazing female character for such a show. A ruthless matriarch who doesn't just sit behind her man but does a lot of twisted things herself.

I really don't want to list all of them. My review would go forever then, but every single of the characters was very well thought through and brilliantly performed by a very talented cast. I will be happy to see them in other shows as well as other creations by Kurt Sutter.
