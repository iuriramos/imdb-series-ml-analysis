Sons of Anarchy not only has one of the best casts I have ever seen, it also has fantastic storytelling and very real and believable dialogue. Kurt Sutter does a perfect job of making the town of Charming come to life, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Every actor knocks it out of the park, there isn't a single uninteresting character in the show. Doesn't matter if I came to love or hate someone, they all contributed to the show in a good way, had their own personality and quirks all while being completely genuine. I can't say enough good about this show, it is collectively the best series I have ever had the privilege of watching.
