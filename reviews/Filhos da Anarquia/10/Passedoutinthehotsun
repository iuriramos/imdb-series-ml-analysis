With no star power, no big budget, and no playing on pop culture, Kurt Sutter creates a masterpiece about one simple yet dynamic issue we all can relate to, and that is family.

I am not of fan of Harleys, bikers, leather, etc. I have always been a sci-fi/ fantasy junkie. When my friend told me I had to watch this show, I obliged only out of boredom. Thank the good lord for boredom.

SOA is a tale of a family of bikers in Cali. The dynamics and struggles they face can seem alien to those of us who abide by the law, sit in cubicles and drive minivans. I do none of the following, but still, I am like you, one who lives on the grid. SAMCRO (Sons of Anarchy Redwood Original) does not. Yet still, inside of the dark shell of lawlessness and well-paced, not overly used violence in the show, you see a family struggling to find their places beside one another. You see a strict and very dramatic set of rules governing the club.

With flaws abound in each character, there are no true stereotypes. Sutter did a fantastic job with his homework, and after viewing two or three episodes, I never once thought of our cast as one dimensional or clich√©d. The cast is near perfect. No true stars, but superbly talented veterans. Kim Coates is a highly underrated actor and nowhere near a household name, but he is "that guy". You know, the guy you've seen dozens of times but has never headlined a major film. Boone, Perlman and Flanagan all fall into this category, and all are equally tremendous.

I will reveal no other information about the show, as I want you to view it as I did. I want you to sit down with no reservations and practical expectations. If you do, you will find SOA to be one of the most addicting and well-written shows ever. Yes, I said ever. Now go, go and be sure to have plenty of snacks within arms reach, cause there is no way in hell you will want to leave the couch.
