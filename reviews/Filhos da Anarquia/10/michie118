I really don't get the people rating this 1 star etc. This easily for me one of the best TV series i have ever had the pleasure of watching up there with The wire,24 and the sopranos. Every episode has plenty of action and sure its a bit over the top sometimes but who cares honestly. I particularly love the character Kim Coates plays Tig who just gets better all the time. I have watched SOA up till the most recent episode on my own and i am currently near the end of season 3 with my wife so keep up the brilliant work Love it! Also what more do you need when Robocop himself Mr Peter Weller is involved lol. Great actors all playing their part and i just cant wait to see more.
