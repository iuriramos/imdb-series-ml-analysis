Beautifully written and impeccably executed drama series. The story is unique, it develops slowly and nurtures every character individually. The show's biggest victory is in its ability to lure the viewers into the characters so deeply that as you go along you feel the happiness the characters feel, their pain becomes your pain and their triumphs give you joy. Being a big fan of smart television shows, I hardly thought that a drama focused on a motorcycle club could throw up such intelligent situations that would rival or even better what other stellar TV series have done. Sons of Anarchy thoroughly educated and satisfied on so many levels that it feels unjust to write about it further, lest it spoils the journey for you. So watch the show, the ride with SOA will blow your senses.
