Living in France, the show wasn't on air as earlier as it was in USA. So, i had to wait, and i somehow managed to look all the episodes that already aired.

In my life, there was never any movie or any series that was entertaining enough to give me an adrenaline rush... This show is.

Overall cast is pretty good, even if i'm not a big fan of Hunnam, which, i think, always play his roles the same way.

Kurt Sutter managed to improve his writing skills from The Shield to deliver us a show with great things happening, from good to worse (i don't want to say too much details), and the best part of it is that everything happening makes sens.

I fell in love with the show and i can't wait to watch next episodes.

Good show when you are "in need" of violence, or just when you want to relax and spend nice time in front of your screen.

10/10.
