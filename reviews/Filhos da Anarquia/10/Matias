Just finished this show and I miss it already . Kurt Sutter really created something perfect with the right amount of love/hate in every character and makes you feel in love with the show for the first minute of running until the very last second . I think I never liked a character so much like I did with Jax Teller (with the great performance of Charlie Hunnam being a bad-ass biker with a philosophical mind that really make you think that every bad decision he makes is the right one) . I am not a very social person but seeing the brotherhood and love that this bikers have for each other really makes me want to be in that kind of weird relationship.
