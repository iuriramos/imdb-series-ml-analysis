Guarantee you, Rat is a rat. Not saying he's the one selling out the club to others, but I guarantee you he's an undercover FBI, DEA, or ATF. Just look at how he acts when something starts to go down. Almost like he's thinking, "Is now when I should break my cover?" "Is this going too far?" Technically, he should have broke cover long ago, since he's not supposed to let people die, but it's a TV show after all. What do you think? Overall, I love the show. I mean, it can get a little extreme like when Jax just offed the other Prez without really clearing it with anyone. I mean, he's been doing a lot of things that people are afraid to tell him to slow his roll, and they're just going through the motions right now because they know he'll do like Clay and off anyone who doesn't agree with him, but even that was a bit much. Just my opinion, though.
