I just started watching "Sons of Anarchy" and already it's become one of my favorite shows.

The writing is excellent, and way too complex to really be able to properly sum up here.

I have to say, I've been really impressed with how TV shows have become much better forms of entertainment than the movies being put out from Hollywood.

Thanks to shows like "Sons of Anarchy", I haven't completely lost faith in Hollywood just yet. Hopefully the show will continue to be as good as it has been. It's really addicting once you start watching it. You watch one episode and you find yourself wanting to immediately watch the next one. That's partly due to the way they always seem to end episodes with a crazy cliffhanger.

I would definitely recommend watching this show, but keep in mind it does contain pretty adult material, so if you're kind of uptight, you might not like it, but I don't think that should be any reason to keep you from watching it. Give it a shot! I really think you'll enjoy it.
