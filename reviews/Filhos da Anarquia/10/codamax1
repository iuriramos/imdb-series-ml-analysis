I just want to say Sutter is brilliant ...this last episode was out of this world good. I know good and I know bad this was great Yes there were a few continuity issues. But I doubt most people with out the eye saw it. ! Sutter I can't wait to see what project you come up with next . We will all Be anxiously awaiting . Charlie Hunnam I hope he gets several more awards For his role on this show. I cant even imagine the toll on his personal life to get in and Stay in character for this role. A m a z i n g !!! Sutter U are brilliant... Katey amazing the whole cast did a great job and we Are all going to hate to see this great show end. I wonder how many knock offs will appear
