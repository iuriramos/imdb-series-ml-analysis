Im currently binge watching this show on Netfix and I cannot stop watching. It's so addictive and so very good. I haven't come across a show like this for a long time. My sister introduced it to me and I've been hooked since. I'm a bit of a Harley fan myself so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw all the Harley's. And then I saw Jax and I think my girly romantic heart skipped a beat. In terms of the writing, producing, directing, etc. All excellent. The one thing, and trust me, it's the only thing, that is bugging me is the overuse of the phrase "Jesus Christ". This isn't a problem for me in terms of blasphemy but I hear it at least 5 times in each episode and it is kind of getting on my nerves now. For an English watcher, Im not sure on the regulations on swearing in the US. But they could try and broaden their cursing or outbursts. Other than that, this show is perfect. Surprises at every corner and moments you go "No way!" and "Dont do it!". I'd seen this show advertised before but never really looked further into it, regretting that now! It's excellent. Side note: be prepared for a lot of Charlie Hunman's butt. It's a true piece of art of which could be compared to Michaelangelo.
