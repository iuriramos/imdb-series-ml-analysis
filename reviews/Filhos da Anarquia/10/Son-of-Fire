Kurt Sutter proved himself by the screenplay on the 6th season finale. That was savagely and genius. He correlated the happenings extraordinarily and really shocked me! About inside... Gemma is the most irritating character of the series. Katey Sagal is acting her part perfectly but nearly all of the spectators hope to see her dead. And Wayne.. He is cancer from the beginning of the series but he never died. Man, Nero you're on the wrong way. So, Tara's death means Jax doesn't need to go to jail anymore. He turned upside down. Think he'll spew his anger all around, destroy everything on his way and there's a 7th season within entirely club-fights and a tragedy final.
