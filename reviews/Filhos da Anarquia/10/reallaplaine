Sons of Anarchy is simply a marvelous depiction of life in the criminal underworld of biker clubs. The quality of acting in this series puts many television series to shame. Every actor did an incredible performance, particularly the main cast which is seen throughout. The character development, the twists and turns and all the things this MC goes through, drives one to binge-watching. One falls in love with the characters, as bad and evil as they become, and of course, with some, all you can think about is exacting the worst possible pain on them for their acts. I could never return to watching a superficial CSI series, with bland acting and Hollywood models, after watching Sons of Anarchy - because these actors were the real thing. I never cried at the end of a single TV series in my entire life - but as the final episode neared the end, I couldn't help it. I was living every second of the story until the last second. I'm told that it didn't get more awards because of the "violence" depicted, and on that count I say this - HYPOCRITES. Are you kidding me. These bubble-gum CSI and murder series which abound on television are just as violent, whereas with Sons of Anarchy, it depicts the reality of an entire sub-culture which exists not only in America, but around the world. It has no equal. Watch it folks. You will lose sleep.
