Wow just when I thought FX couldn't do better than the shield I got the Sons of Anarchy. This show is just about perfect. Ron Pearlman and Katy Segal make two of the most interesting villains I have seen in a long time, (the trick is I am not sure if they can be called villains or not, they do bad things but for semi good reasons) even the supporting cast shines in this show. The story with Opie and his family made for one of the most heart rending moments all season. I just hope season 2 keeps the same high values as season 1. This is one of those shows that I find myself waiting to come on from week to week I haven't been this excited about a show since the Shield and Rescue Me. Long Live SAMCRO
