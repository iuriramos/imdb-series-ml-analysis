It's not often a show comes along where you cannot find fault but this one nails it! I stumbled across it through a friend as we only get the mainstream shows in the UK (you cant even get the DVD over here!)and I never thought I'd be interested in a drama about a gun-running motorcycle club but it's so well executed that I couldn't help but get hooked! The characters are complicated, unpredictable and totally believable (the casting is spot on). You don't always agree with the decisions they make or like the things they say and do but it's so well thought out that you just get pulled into the world of SAMCRO. Season 2 has already opened with a great storyline and I'm enjoying it even more than season 1.
