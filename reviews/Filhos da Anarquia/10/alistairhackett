Sons of Anarchy is a phenomenal TV show. It is very underrated and should go down as one of the top 10 of all time.The show is non stop action but also has a very good storyline. The writing by Kurt Sutter is also outstanding. The characters he created aren't just regular TV show characters, they are incredibly unique. For instance, Chibs. He is not the typical kind of guy you would see in a California MC, but it was the creativity of Kurt Sutter that incorporated him. I have watched Breaking Bad, Prison Break, Person of Interest, and SOA and SOA is without a doubt the second best one. If you have Netflix, watching it is very easy to do. I absolutely recommend SOA!
