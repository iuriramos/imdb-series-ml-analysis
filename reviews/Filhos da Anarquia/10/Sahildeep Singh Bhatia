my friend suggested me to watch SOA....and i thank him for this....this TV series is one of the riveting TV series ...the one i would say next to prison break...u just need to last 5-6 episodes of the season 1 ...and after tat u join the journey of samcro boys....with every season finale ull get goosebumps and more eager to see the next season....this TV series binds u in such a way that u can feel the fight , emotions ,love ,hate,wrong ,right..everything of the characters in the TV series...SOA is one of the best shows...jax the lead of the series has acted to good his expressions, his anger , emotions , his love i would give him 10/10 ...so goes for his old lady Tara knowles.SOA leaves u in the state of thinking where u are eager to know what is going to happen next.. I personally became so attached to the series tat i finished of the first six seasons in 3 weeks and now waiting for the last and the final season now....its bad tat the series will return in September..i would recommend new viewers to wait till july so tat u don't feel the big break .... with the end of season 6 i have reached the state where i cant wait...also the songs selected are perfectly executed.. right song for the right moment......
