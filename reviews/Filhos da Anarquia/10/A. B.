When this show was recommended to me I thought 'Bikers?.. Well, I don't know, doesn't sound that interesting.' I was WRONG! Just several minutes into the show I had realized this was something special. And that time I was right. This show is simply amazing. All the characters are played by great actors (looks like that they were written specially for them) and the story itself is very deep. If you have any doubts about it - don't. It is a must see.

To make it short, just sit back, relax and enjoy this full-of-action series. Heck, I think I'll just go and start watching all the episodes all over again.
