We were hooked on Sons of Anarchy after watching the first episode, the acting is first class and it actually has believable story lines. It makes a real change from all these hyped up US shows like Flashforward and the like which are rubbish. Was not sure they would be able to carry it to a second series as well, but so far it has been every bit as good (if not better)as the first series. The standout performance has to be Katey Sagal, she can be hard nosed and menacing one minute and generous and soft the next - a brilliant actress who deserves every award going for her portrayal of Gemma. The soundtrack is also awesome, some great music bringing something to emphasize the storyline brilliantly. All in all 10 out of 10, if you don't like this genre of programme think again, everyone should watch this.
