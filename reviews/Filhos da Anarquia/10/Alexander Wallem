I was bored in holidays and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Little did I know... I've watched all 95 episodes in almost exactly one week. This made me get so much into the life of SAMCRO, I fell like a patched member. I have surprised myself with how emotional I was during the viewing, and usually I'm quite a stone faced guy. I laughed, I teared up, I got furious simultaneously with the club. When the last season delivered the last unexpected scene, I couldn't help myself and broke down. I want to applaud to Kurt Sutter for giving the show a special touch, along with some small clues(?), such as the homeless woman and crows. I hope the rumored prequel will make it's way on the screens soon!
