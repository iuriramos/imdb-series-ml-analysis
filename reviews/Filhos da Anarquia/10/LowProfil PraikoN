One of the best TV-Series I've watched , I just finished it yesterday.

If u start watching it you will love all about SOA , the characters, the story line , the club and more.Eventually you're beginning to realize how toxic can it be that kind of life.As Jackson at the first episodes and a few seasons maybe , wasn't that cruel , revengeful , so soulless.Struggling to be a member of a club like that and a good husband / father.He had so much to lose , that's what didn't allowed him to be clear-headed at all.As he said on his last words talking to J.T's spot , ~The war with your own mind is more difficult that anything else"~. Even that he knew the story , the purposes , the end of his father he didn't managed to avoid it.History repeated itself. At least Jackson sacrificed himself and managed to cut ties and deals with gun,drug business from the club as his father wanted. He secured a good life for his kids.That's what a true leader does.And Jacks did it. Now somethings that I didn't like for example Gemma should suicide , I mean how could she even lived after all?How could she let Jackson take a huge burden like that from killing her.Because she knew that Jacks will have to kill her eventually.I think that kill swallowed Jackson.She should wrote a suicide note to admit everything and kill herself.But instead she acted selfishly for one more time.

However, I loved every second of it.Lets hope for a spin-off with the first nine or maybe from his son Abel. RIP SAMCRO!
