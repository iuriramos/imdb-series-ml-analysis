It's said that most series have their peak somewhere inn season 4, and that quality tends to drop inn both storyline and cinematic sequences. This is something that SOA with it's both " realistic" and serious manners manage to avoid. The way history is written, and things turns, the show only get better and better by episode. Carracters gets to evolve with itself within the show, while manuscript manage to make this one of the best series on international TV ever. It's fear to mention that every season have half of episodes usually used to be filmed, but this is maybe also what makes it a great show. Quality before quantity! Anyone doubting this. See it for yourself!
