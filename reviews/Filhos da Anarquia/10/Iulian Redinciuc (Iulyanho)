The best ending of a series i've ever seen until now and also the best musical moments you can find. The action and story line is well defined and the actors are very complex. The final scene was better then I expected as you see a element on the ground and realize something you've seen a lot in some episodes and will give you some chills.The morality of the show is the struggle of choosing between what you love to do and what you should do for the loved ones, the demons you need to fight in order to thank everyone without betray anyone at the same time. I highly recommend to watch the show as long as you love rock music, choppers and the meaning of the word "brotherhood".
