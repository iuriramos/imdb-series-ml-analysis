Sons of Anarchy is a top notch show about a biker gang in a small town. It is one of the best written shows on TV right now, the characters are well thought out, the acting is amazing and the directing is great. From personal problems, to dealing with gangs, to dealing with the law, this show stretches the limit, and does it brilliantly. Now in it's second season, the show is at a very high point in it's young life, here's to hoping the 7 seasons planned, come to light. 

The best characters are Jax and Clay, they play well off of each other and Katy Sagal is great as Gemma. I will be watching this series hopefully for a long time, and I hope it continues to do well because you'd be crazy not to like this show.
