This show has so much going for it--and I'm glad F/X has chosen to continue this ride. (Sorry, I just couldn't resist that little pun.) The writing is incredible and the characters are are so well developed that viewers can relate to them--perhaps even respect them, in spite of their obvious flaws, weaknesses, and challenges that draw us to them. The cast is incredibly talented--each actor is strong enough to be a lead and carry their own story-line but, as an ensemble, they're even stronger and they definitely bring their best performance to each and every episode. I was very skeptical about Katy Sagal ever selling me on a character other than "Peg Bundy", and I admit, I was dead wrong! She IS Gemma! (RIP Peggy....) There are so many reasons this show has viewers hooked--If I tried to list them, I'd run out of space! It only took one episode for me to be a major fan. The only thing wrong with the show is that the season is way too short!! This is a strong show with equally strong subject matter and delivery, and F/X schedules it accordingly-so if you're easily offended (or if you have children/teen viewers), perhaps you should opt for another channel (and DVR/TIVO it for later viewing).
