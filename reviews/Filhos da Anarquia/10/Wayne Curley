sons of anarchy, its the best biker TV series on TV, it really give you a look into the life of a mc club and member, it juggles between Jax Teller's life with the mc and being a father. With a load of explosive scenes firstly starting with the birth of his son with the child's mother being a junkie and going to rehab and Jax left to raise the child with the help of his mother and new gf, then showing them fighting with other mc clubs and then neo natzi's etc. Then when Abel's kid-napped by a IRA member and Jax is doing everything he can to find his son, going to Ireland then finding out he has a half sister thats Irish. Then finally finding Abel, Jax heads back to charming with ATF and all crawling on there doorstep exposing Jax as a rat and then the sons getting sent down and illumination all there treats and showing it was a club decision Jax being a rat just to play the ATF into getting the club less time in prison and getting Gemma of the hook for murder.

With season 4 on the way i myself can't wait to see what happens with the sons getting out of jail and the 21st century finally hitting charming and a new chapter in the Harrison. And i hope there's a lot more episodes in season 4 because the only problems with seasons 1-3 is that they didn't go on longer and i would say most sons of anarchy fans would agree.
