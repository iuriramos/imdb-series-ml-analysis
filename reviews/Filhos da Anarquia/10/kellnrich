I just started watching SOA last year but caught up with the first 5 seasons before season 6 started...I love this show and most of the characters. Opie,Piney,Tara & Donna's deaths devastated me because I have grown attached to each character over time. For the longest time I went back and forth with Tig but seasons 6-7 he has spent time redeeming himself. Chibs and Bobby will probably always be my favorites based on the way they try to be Jax's conscience when he needs even if he tends to go his own way. I love Jax but really hate the darkness inside of him that he's starting to let loose since losing Opie and Tara. If Gemma were a real person I'd hit her in the face with a skateboard like she did to Cherry lol. I hated Wendy to start but now I'm kind of hoping she gets Nero and the boys. As this is the final season I'm truly hoping Gemma gets what's coming to her in the form of an enraged son. I had a love/hate relationship with Clay. Out of all the guys of SAMCRO I have to say that Happy would be my #1 favorite just because he's a bad-ass on and off screen...he's a real life Hell's Angel!! I'll be sad when it's gone but I have the first 6 seasons on DVD and I'll satisfy need for season 7 until I can get it on DVD.
