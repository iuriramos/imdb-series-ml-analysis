Contrary to what seems like 90% of the public I did not enjoy Breaking Bad & thought it unworthy of the hype. Everyone would tell me 'stick with it' 'it gets better after a certain series ' but my reply was always that if a series doesn't entice you from the get go then it wasn't worth watching the whole way through.

I had a similar fears when I sat down to watch Sons of Anarchy after a recommendation from a friend. But after two weeks I've finished all seven series & I'm at a loss as to what to do with my free time. Sons isn't for everyone but it is a fantastically written series whose characters become your family. You connect with every character as an individual which I haven't found with many other series I've watched. You will have at least five or six favourite characters throughout the series (but don't get too attached Sutter's writing is ruthless- no one is safe)

Both Kurt Sutter's writing & the incredibly well chosen cast shine through and I never wanted it to end.
