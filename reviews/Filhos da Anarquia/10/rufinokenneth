excellent show. i've crossed paths before with show then one day i decided to give it as hot. on the second episode i was hooked on and never stopped watching the show. the end of season 7 is a extremely sad. i recommend seeing this show and paying attention. 10/10 excellent. this show tends to be sad a few times makes you feel inpatient. all of the issues tend to make you feel that way. the amazing cast makes it feel right and including a few funny scenes with David labrava. including his real experience as a member of a real California motorcycle club. its extremely sad towards the end of the 6th season and towards the end of the 7th season. i really recommend this show for adults only.
