After seeing the commercials on TV my first though was 'just another biker series' as there are so may already.

Sons was running for some time when at some evening while trying to find something decent to look I took the time to was an episode, Immediately I was hooked...

Me and my wife started over again at episode one, although it starts slow, but you get the urge to keep watching. Now, after 4 seasons we know that the first few episodes are needed to create the plot for the rest of the season, but still you are not bored at all.

It became clear to us that this isn't at all just another biker series! Sons of anarchy is great combination between drama, thriller, action and die hard mobster.

We watched all episodes and can't wait for the new season to come. This is one of the best series we watched in years.
