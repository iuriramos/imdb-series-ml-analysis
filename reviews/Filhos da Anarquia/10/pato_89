Excellent show that transcends even further to teach about love, respect and friendship! 

Charlie Hunnam and Ron Perlman are both very gifted actors, who can clearly be seen pushing their talents to their limits, episode after episode. I am glad to see the multi-facet Katy Sagal also pushing the envelope, standing in between his son's affairs and his husband's.

The MCClub is a tough life, with enemies around every corner, guns to sell, people to pay (and to kill)... and SOA goes beyond this, by showing that the characters can love, laugh, care, worry and cry.

Can't wait for season 4!
