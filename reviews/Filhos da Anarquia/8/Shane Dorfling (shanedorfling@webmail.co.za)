I started watching Season 7. Got hooked and then had t watch the previous 6 seasons as if it was a prequel to Season 7.

In doing this, I actually enjoyed watching the seasons one after the other, in order to understand how Jax came to be.

There were some emotional episodes, but the one standing out is the episode where Opie made the decision to save Jax and take one for the team. My favorite character of the entire series was Opie and my favorite quote was "I Got This".

Some episodes were a little boring, but only until the end of the episode where you could not wait to start watching the next one.

My advice in watching a series is to watch them one after the other to really enjoy it.

I really do hope that Kurt Sutter will create some sort of prequel to the SOA.

I LOVED IT!!!
