Having finished recently I thought id give my opinion on this show and how great i think it is. I could talk about this show for hours but ill keep it brief. This show is pretty great. The performances were fantastic throughout with the likes of Charlie hunnam Ron Perlman and Katey Seagel being the stand outs. There is also a lot of action throughout the show that is directed for the most part really well. There are also lots of twists and turns throughout the show that will shock you and at times make you feel sick. Which is one of the things that makes this show unique. These people are just bad people there is no way around that. Which is why at times these characters that you are rooting for are going to do things that makes you wonder why you are even rooting for this gang of bikers which is great. The show is not perfect however. There is a lot of downtime where the main story isn't really progressing and this really shows in the final season where nothing really happens but then in the final 3 episodes it all kicks off. Also at times the writing could get a little sloppy but definitely not bad in anyway. Overall i really enjoyed this show and its sad to see it go. You should definitely at least give sons of anarchy a chance as it takes you on one hell of a ride.
