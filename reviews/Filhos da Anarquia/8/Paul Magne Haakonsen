I was recommended to watch this back in 2008 or 2009 by a friend, but always shrugged it off, as I am not overly keen on TV series and gang-related stuff in general. So it is not actually before now late in 2012 that I have actually gotten acquainted with the "Sons of Anarchy" series. And boy have I been missing out on something great.

The characters in the series are well-developed, with lots of background story and motives to drive them on, and that is really one of the things that I really enjoyed about the series. All the characters are nicely portrayed on the screen and each given great chances to give us (the viewers) a glimpse into whom they are, what makes them tick, and follow them as they grow during the course of the running episodes.

And for the cast, they had really, and I do mean really, gotten together some very great actors and actresses for the roles. Lots of familiar faces whom you know will deliver the goods, and all bring their own unique touch to each character. My personal favorite character in the show was Harry 'Opie' Winston (played by Ryan Hurst), as I found his character to have the most interesting background and the most dramatic of events happen to him.

The fact that "Sons of Anarchy" revolves a motorcycle gang is not bad, it really made for a great breeding ground for plot lines and interesting approached the to the story. So, don't do what I did, shrug it off just because of this fact.

If you enjoy series where you get to know the characters well, and if you are entertained by a deep running, solid storyline, then "Sons of Anarchy" is a definite must watch. And the way that the episodes are directed really leaves you wanting for more. There are some great cliffhangers and really good continuations of the storyline from episode to episode, and a superb red line throughout the entire series.

This is great entertainment and lots of fun.
