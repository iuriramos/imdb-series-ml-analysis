This is not a perfect show or even a great one but it is one I would highly recommend to anyone who likes a good story and this is a good story about love, hate and the ties that bind and choke you to death. The acting is wonderful by everyone; most notably Katey Sagal who gives the performance of a lifetime as the Matriarch of an outlaw biker club. This is not a show for everyone and it sometimes gets lost in its own drama but I disagree that season 7 was a letdown. I think it was a necessary outcome of everything that came before; a man with nothing to lose and nothing to live for. SOA is not the greatest show of all time but it sure was one of hell of a fun ride.
