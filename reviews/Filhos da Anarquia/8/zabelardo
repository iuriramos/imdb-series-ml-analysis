Pros: ~ Excellent acting, from performers ~ Strong screen writing, and plot development ~ All-Star, celebrity cast ~ Expert Cinematography ~ Good chase scenes ~ Does not glorify the outlaw MC lifestyle ~ Hells Angels Sonny Barger, Chuck Zito and David Labrava appear

Cons: ~ Insane body count, with minimal, logical repercussions ~ Some violence is contrived

"Sons of Anarchy" captivates you with a poignant story of one man's struggle with parenthood, while leading the deadly agendas of a small town, outlaw motorcycle club. The results are staggeringly eye- opening. Everything is for the most part believable, especially the main characters - who are well-developed. The screen writing is top- notch. Just like "Breaking Bad," this series is addictive like the drug Walter White makes.
