Here i am watching the third episode of the first season of Sons Of Anarchy and i remembered why i loved it this show from the first episode : the brightness of the script, how the writers succeeded in maintaining the plot all over the seasons is absolutely remarkable. The casting is tight, a pleasant discovery for me for Channing Hunnam who was excellent in playing his character's emotions. Ron Pearlman's performance is like his any other works : perfectly well done. he list is too long, but every character played was 100% AUTHENTIC. Each season has his own theme like The Wire (which is one of the best TV series ever created ^^) and every next season is getting more better than the other and that what makes Sons of Anarchy unique and 100 times more better than The Sopranos.

I watched The Sopranos and i mean i really force myself to watch it, and the series couldn't approach the gangster games, plot, revenge, love, betrayal like Sons of Anarchy did. I assure you, you will be hooked after the first or second episode.
