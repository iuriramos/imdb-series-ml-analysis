To be quite frank when I had first seen the coming attractions for FX's new bad-ass biker T.V show the only thought that popped into my head was "Great, another *BANG BANG* exploding gang violence drama". And from what I could gather, that was a pretty popular consensus. But i decided to give "Sons Of Anarchy" the benefit of the doubt and watch the pilot. And let me tell you, Kurt Sutter slapped my previous opinion right in the face. Each member of the club has his/her own unique, individual personality. Like for example, Clay Morrow president of the club, first nine and revered as the foremost authority on all club and domestic matters. Or Alex "Tig" trigger the Sgt. At Arms; Clay's right hand man and a violent and horny sadistic animal with a passion for bedding whores and biting off chunks of peoples ears. And then there is the main protagonist, Jackson Teller the young Vice President whose deeply conflicted on the matter of where this club is and where its going. So while the action can be somewhat repetitive and the show can often become predictable. I find myself coming back week after week to see these characters that i have an inexplicable connection to.
