I love this show but I find myself in hate with the main characters Jax Teller and his girlfriend Tara Knowles.

I don't think that Charlie Hunnam was ever the right person to play Jax Teller (he should have stuck with gay-dude roles like the one he played on Queer as Folk). I think he is an awful actor and doesn't pull off the biker-dude role AT ALL. His on-set girlfriend, Maggie Siff, is nothing to write home about either (she was horrible on Nip/Tuck too). 

Other than those two the rest of the cast is awesome, if it weren't for Ron Pearlman and Katey Sagal the show would have tanked in my humble opinion.
