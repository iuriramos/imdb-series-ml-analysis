I have watch all seven seasons of the show a few times now. I was hooked from season one episode one and was always left wondering what would happen next. Between the second and third time watching it I watched Blue Bloods and then watched SOA again after that. Then I started thinking about it all to critically I suppose but it is what it is. I was half way way through season one for the third time when I realized this. Danny from blue-bloods would have already shut it down before the end of season one with his first partner. Most of it you know is unrealistic but I humor myself by comparing the two shows. After I watched Danny and his family doing their thing I realized that Danny would have taken off running after them and make sure its done and over with. I am sure that their are gangs that do some of the stuff they do but its highly unlikely. Maybe I am thinking to much into it since it is just a TV show. It just seems like the last six season were just filler to keep it going on to make sure that there was a cushion behind it after it finished up. I still gave it a decent rating because I still like the show just not in the same capacity as before. Thank you for reading my review.
