Sons of Anarchy is a good to great show. It's hard to believe it was on FX and not HBO. I will miss it and it deserves credit for bringing a certain grit and realism for a cable series. I've been with the show since Day 1 and the argument was always too much Gemma. Gemma, Gemma...MF Gemma. Anyone new to the show will go through the same thing, so to all of you I have to say try to get over it. I and many other fans had to get over it but it should be easier to live with if you know before hand that the show is more about Gemma than anything. Watching it from day 1 to the end proved more difficult with handling that. It was the shows only true flaw. ******SPOILERS BELOW****** The first two seasons are great. They set you up for the struggle of the entire series. Jax, Clay, Gemma, JT...the club and family struggle. You think that the show is about Jax and his struggle but it is not. It's about Gemma and her struggle. She is/was in many of our minds at the beginning supposed to be a gatekeeper of secrets. A go-between character that is involved in everything because of what she knows and her relationships with Clay, Jax and JT but she's actually the centerpiece of the show. The show is about HER struggle. She's the Shakespearean tragic figure of the show and not Jax. What happens to her at the end is appropriate and it is filled with emotion. What happens to Jax is empty and unnecessary. The series is great because of all the ensemble moments with SAMCRO and definitely worth watching.
