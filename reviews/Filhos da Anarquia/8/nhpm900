I really, really love this show. I only recently discovered it and have been binge watching on Netflix. The story lines are original, the acting is excellent and the music is awesome. There's just one thing I don't understand. Why could they not have used actual Irish actors for the scenes which were supposed to feature Irish people. Nowhere was this more cringe worthy than the scenes that were set in Belfast. As an Irish born person, I was appalled at the fake accents. Not the fault of the actors, of course, it's not easy speaking in an accent that is foreign to you. There are plenty of US based, talented Irish actors out there. They really should have used some of them, particularly as the Irish element was so extensive in Season 3. 

I wonder what Americans think of the quality of Jax's US accent?
