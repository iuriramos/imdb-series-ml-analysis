I love this show it's not my top favorite of course,but it's a fantastic show..I wish they wouldn't of made the main character Jackson so dang hateful at this point, but I do love what they have done with this show I always look forward to the next episode to see what stupid things Jackson will do next...or who will die next!! A lot of people say you have to turn off your brain to watch this show.. Haha!! which I don't completely understand unless all they ever watch is animal planet Bc let's face it its a TV show..we watch them for the thrills and the stupidity and excitement of what's going to happen to what character..I would of gave this show a 10 except I don't like how they're ending it so soon and I feel like there are a lot of stories left out on Gemma I would really like to know in more detail what all Gemma has done and what she's been through to make her who she is...I also of course hate that they had to kill off Opie so fast..he was one of my Favies!!
