I really don't know what to think about Sons of Anarchy. I have mixed feelings about it and impressions of it. This show has always had the potential to be a great series and so many times it made me think of it as a great TV show, thanks to the story line, the characters, the excitement, the twists ..etc. But so many other times I felt stupid watching this show and would find myself saying in my head (and some times out loud)"Oh, come on! What's this?" or "Be realistic, for god's sake!"I find myself wondering, why all this complication? Keep it simple! A problem is never solved until another bigger one says hello to the club... What brings me back on track are the twists and surprises that seem like bonuses from the writers, (in the season finales, mainly) to reward me for being patient and for fighting those moments of disappointment. This show is definitely made for consumption and entertainment without too much thinking behind it, and like so many other TV shows, it is a victim of Breaking Bad, The Wire, and Game of thrones..all those masterpieces that are almost flawless. I say "victim" because anyone who watched those masterpieces I mentioned is going to find it hard not to criticize Sons of Anarchy
