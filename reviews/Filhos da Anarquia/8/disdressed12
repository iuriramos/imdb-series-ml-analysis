from what i saw of this show,i liked it.it's probably a bit rough for some people though,what with the language and the gritty realism.it doesn't hold too much back in that regard.i can say this because i lived with members of a bike club at one time,and they pretty much act the same way as they are portrayed in the series.it doesn't air in Canada,as far as i know,so the only option is to catch it on DVD so far.it definitely isn't for everyone.one of the biggest reasons i was interested in seeing the show was Katey Sagal,whom i had only previously known from Married with Children and 8 Simple Rules.i must say,she is really impressive in "Sons".not once was i reminded of her other characters.obviously she is a very gifted actress.the rest of the cast is also superb.if you don't mind strong language and violence,give this show a shot.you might enjoy it.for me,"Sons of Anarchy" is an 8/10
