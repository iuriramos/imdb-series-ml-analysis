One of the best series written for TV... there are few criticisms... (imagine the extreme violence, profanity, nudity, and absence of most all moral values would turn off many though). But like all great series television, it has everything (good and bad)... great writing, acting, casting, directing, production-values.. everything. And there's not just one or two top notch acting performances.. the whole entire group is near flawless... awards can go to any number of them. Now running an amazing seven years, its damn near unbelievable to maintain that high quality level for that length of time. It might end soon, but that's not so bad. We just all have to truly appreciate what we've experienced during these many wonderful years (ok.. up until S7). PS-... as the show has now gotten long-in-the-tooth, it's real problem is there's hardly now any characters truly likable remaining.. and the loss of one of the shows main leads, and the 'nicest' individual in the production was a huge blow. Through the years its gotten darker and more gory (if that's possible), and ya get the distinct feeling it's going to be getting lots worse. (Question- ..with all the killing spree mayhem now going on in this little town.. how could armed storm troopers from state and federal government not be all over the place??)
