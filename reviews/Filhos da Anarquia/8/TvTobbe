Great show that feels brutally real and down to earth honest. Gladly without over exaggerated Hollywoodmanners in acting and fx.

The only obstacle to get a full 10 star is the feeling of some episodes being pure fillers and some unrealistic events and actions by characters just to bring the story of the episode home. But overall this is one of my favorite TV-shows for being somewhat alone in its genre, at least here in Sweden and the channels I access, and for the good casting of actors. An exception is the casting of prospects who are characterless and look far to bleak and geeky like if the only tough guys in the county are the ones around the table and in other gangs. The difference gets a little to much.
