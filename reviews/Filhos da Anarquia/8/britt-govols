This is a great show & we are excited to now offer an official shirt on our all women's motorcycle site, Asphalt Sisters. The characters are compelling and well-developed and the story line keep me coming back for more. I am disappointed I read that the 7th season will be the last. I suppose it's better to wrap it up while the show is still interesting, though. Particularly, the growth of Jax is interesting, as his world view is shifted. With the gun-running and bike gang theme, the shows can be rough at times. It does not seem gratuitous, though. The violence/cursing, etc. fits into the story in an authentic way. The characters are many times those that you develop a love-hate relationship with. While they are good at times, they can be awful and you find yourself rooting for them anyway.
