Harley's, cool dude's, gorgeous chicks, guns, random and reckless violence and gratuitous sex - what's not to like?!

The only surprise here is Michael Chicklis not appearing as a rival gang-leader - he's big and ugly enough (He did make a cameo in a prison cell TV screening of The Shield...)!

I've watched all 69 episodes these past 3 weeks and it's been a roller coaster of a ride. For no reason that I can explain I cried during Opie's funeral episode. It's strange how you can miss somebody so much in death yet they never had a huge impact while alive??

This series has the same grit and realism of The Shield but more character and plot depth. As mentioned in earlier reviews, too many of the twists and turns are implausible if not downright ridiculous but we still soak it all up and love it nonetheless.

Opie's death sentence by the gang was the low-point for me credibility-wise. For the gang to condemn poor old hapless Opie for installing federal wiretaps in his pick-up without confronting him and to kill his wife by mistake smacks of bad script writing, as such a thing would just not happen in SAMCRO reality?? 

Oh, and like other viewers I think I was well into series 2 before I 'discovered' that Sam Crowe wasn't actually a person! Poor writing again guys...

Where did we want Series 6 to go? All 5 series' have been leading towards Jax up tailing it with his wife and kids and heading East and S5 finishes off with him more ensconced as Gang President than ever - doing even crazier stuff than Clay might have done.
