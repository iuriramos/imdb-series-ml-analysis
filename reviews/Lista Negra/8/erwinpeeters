I think the series is good, or at least the first season and the first half of the second season. The acting is good, the writing is good. Some of the ideas are original. I have enjoyed this series. But, and there is a big but....

The writers are grasping at straws, things that were 100% explained are suddenly not explained. Conspiracy after conspiracy, no it is this guy, no it is that guy. He is good, no he is bad. So many twists it is becoming hard to follow.

I really don't understand why writers and producers think that if a series like this gets another season you have to change everything about what people know. Intrigue upon intrigue. This is where i draw the comparison with Alias. That show started well enough, but in the 3rd season it was getting ridiculous. Conspirary within a conspiracy,within a conspiracy.

A good TV how IMO is not about twists and turns, it is about a good story and not about chancing the whole premise of the show in the last 2 episodes of a season.

Please let the writers be grounded in the real world for the next season. I like this show but i am afraid that it is going to be another alias
