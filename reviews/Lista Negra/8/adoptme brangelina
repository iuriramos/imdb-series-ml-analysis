Excellent show; only reason not giving it a 10 is Meg's Wig. I thought it was me at 1st, but obviously not. After the break she got a new wig - so not good. It is very very distracting with her wig; I can't explain it, but its driving me crazy, whereas now the past 3 episodes I'm DVRing it and not watching it live.

Producers, director - get rid of her wig; not only is it bad; but it ridiculous for a FBI agent having perfect hair; running.

GET RID OF HER WIG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

James Spader is excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At this point, because of the stupid wig, do we even need Meg on the show.

PS.. Meg natural short hair is beautiful. Take not stylists!
