Get your inept TS/IT staff to extricate their heads from their rectums and do away with that stupid tedious 10 line minimum. The "Following" is a completely unrealistic series, The Blacklist is far more plausible. No such thing as too much James Spader, maybe I am better off not being a IMDb Plus member, with some of the stupid comments I saw posted in the blog, would be spending all my time trying to rationalize with mental midgets. So the show focuses on 4 main characters, or should I say 37% Ray "Red, The Man" Reddington, 23% Elizabeth "Lizzy" Keen, about 20/20 Spec. Agt. Donald Ressler and AD Harold Cooper. My hope is that Tommy Boy is a Russian spy and that Ray My Man Reddington is not Lizzy's father, so he and her can get together, granted he will be in a federal penitentiary, but that is what conjugal visits are for, hey if evading the federal authorities for over 10 yrs. does not qualify you for being an adoptive parent then nothing does.
