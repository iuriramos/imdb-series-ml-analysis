Just finished the first three episodes and i must say i thoroughly enjoyed it. Its fast paced and filled with interesting developments and plots along the way.

I am thrilled the way the first episode has ended and how it paved the way for the coming episodes. Its going to be a exciting ride. Good acting to start with. I really like villain roles in a series. I expect to have many in this series as it will deal with some high value criminals and terrorists.

I will be watching this series for the days to come.

I don't know what the whole series as a bunch will play out but start is awesome and what can you ask for more. Breaking bad is finished. We need more good shows.

For that you have to see it your self and i think you will agree that this show has great potential.

I have rated it as 8 for time being and if it keeps up the same level consistently, the rating will go up definitely.
