This millennium has seen blooming of series where events and characters are intertwined, and single episode does not have a fixed start and summarizing end. On the one hand, it is harder to follow as you basically have to see all episodes in succession, but, on the other hand, it lets to maintain thrill and "confuse" viewers in a skillful manner. Apparently on account of realism and smooth logic, but still... In my opinion, The Blacklist has all signs mentioned above, and thanks to fine performance of James Spader, interesting twists due to the list members and unpredictable characters, the total course of events is interest to follow, and inclusion of a talented Swedish actor Peter Stormare for the next season has made me a true follower who is ready to recommend the series to all fond of sophisticated and peculiar crime series where mystery, emotions and opting between bad and worse are perpetual.
