Only two episodes of this show aired and I must say I am already hooked!

The acting is great, and not just only from James Spader (although he is of course the main distraction), the plot is full of mystery and rhythm.

The only thing that prevents The Blacklist from being a great show, instead of just being "good", is the forcibly displayed sentimentality by the main character, Elizabeth Keen. Does she really have to declare her love for any secondary character she meets (Beth, the little girl in the first episode and Isabella Rossellini's character in the second). 

Really, we can guess that she cares about them without these kind of unnatural scenes.
