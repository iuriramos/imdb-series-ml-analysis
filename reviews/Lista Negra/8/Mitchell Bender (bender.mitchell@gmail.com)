Cope with the first few episodes and your reward will be well worth the wait. I was all but ready to give up on this series upon the ending of episode three, the scenes and plot seemed simply.. ridiculous and outright outlandish; from making the US Marshals look like inexperienced babysitters to animated effects even i could create, i was extremely disappointed. But do not fret, as the series drastically improves after the fifth or sixth episode.

The director starts to become realistic, writing plot lines that seem for the most part, far more realistic. James Spader slowly warms up to his role as a terrorist turned ally, and any plot holes or similarities to similar TV shows start to dissipate.

I saved my very first film review for a reason, I needed to make it personal. I was at one point fully committed that I'd never watch another minute of this show, but i hung in there crossing my fingers that it'd be worth the wait, and boy was it ever worth it. After finishing episode 11 (The Good Samaritan), i am confident this series has pulled together and is becoming a very strong candidate for the best TV series of 2014.
