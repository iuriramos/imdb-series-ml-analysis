The plot is interesting, fast-paced within individual episodes, so that not much time is left for other characters' backgrounds. The inter- episode story is also developing, so it is not an action soap. I got very addicted. I really don't know why, because otherwise much is predictable, main characters seem to feel little or no fear and tension and twists appear artificial.

The mysterious Red is a brilliant character. The mysterious Tom is also good. However, Boone as Liz is completely miscast. Boone would make a good sweet girl role. Teachers, hairdressers... whatever. Just nothing with a gun. She simply doesn't have the face for this type of business, same as Arnie cannot play a teacher in any serious movie. And I wouldn't necessarily blame it on bad acting. The other Agent-characters have no personality. No private life, no feelings, nothing to tell them apart. The villains however are very interesting. Each one is different and I believe this is the part that keeps us in the seats.

Overall: (inexplicably) very good
