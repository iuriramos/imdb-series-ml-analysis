Not sure that people should trust all the negative reviews about this show. Not sure what show the other people posting watched but apparently it wasn't The Blacklist. The show is good. The acting is not bad, it's watchable. The plot was good and leaves a lot of questions and curiosity about our characters and their secrets. In all, the 1st episode was good and leaved me wanting to watch the next. Although this is not as suspenseful and action filled as 24 or Revolution but it's the closest thing to it on TV. Spader's character is cocky and confident and Megan Boone's character is great, although her acting is not the greatest. Her troubled and mysterious past events that happened in her life make up for her acting. This show is a lot better than Marvels Agents of Shield.
