"Oh honey, I could not sleep so I decided to track criminals on the computer," says Lizzie in full makeup. Cut to Lizzie and husband behind opposite sides of same door. Husband bashes Lizzie in head and knocks her to the ground. Husband cold cocks wife in face. Cut to Lizzie with perfect makeup. Ask audience to suspend disbelief? It would be easier to introduce a dragon and a two headed midget into the scene than ask the audience to accept the perfect makeup scenario. This show could be great if they would do something about the ridiculous hair and makeup situation. The writing is superb, the acting is excellent, the action fun, and the directing at the top. LET LIZZIE LOOK REAL!
