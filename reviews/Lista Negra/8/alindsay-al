This series had a lot of buzz before it started and I must say for most of it the show lives up to the hype but I believe the second series has the potential to be even better. The series starts with established con Raymond reddington giving himself up to the FBI to get their help to take down a group of criminals. He only has one clause that he only speaks with Elizabeth Keene. Now in my opinion the acting is mostly good but it is clear that James spader as reddington stands out over everybody, his overall performance is utterly superb and he does everything great to ensure he is the perfect lead for this show. The supporting cast is also very good with Megan Boone doing a great job as Keene and her chemistry with spader is very good and is what the series is really based on. The other performances such as Liz's husband tom and the other agents are performed well and make the rest of the characters a bit interesting. Now thing that does irritate me is for nearly every episode the go exactly the same way and are quite generic, however, towards the finale the overall story gets slightly better but isn't enough to save the overall story. The script is also okay as the exchanges between reddington and Liz are really good but sometimes some of the other dialogue is a bit lackluster. The style of the show is really cool with the action scenes being good and the fast paced editing allowing a relentless style. I am looking forward to watching the second series but I hope it can improve.
