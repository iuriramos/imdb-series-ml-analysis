I will be following this show ,because I saw the pilot recently and it impressed me and so did the next few episodes. What I did not like was the acting- Spader tries to play the mastermind nobody can touch until he wants them to,but somehow I am not convinced he fits the bill.Megan Boone looks good,but her acting is so dull .Same is the case with the supporting cast. About the show,it's definitely fresh and has that complex feel that viewers find intriguing. Overall,the show has an interesting plot and might even have many seasons ahead,but I just wish the actors get it together.The only saving grace in terms of convincing acting are Spader and the woman who plays Meera Malik -the leads could take a tip or two from her. It will be interesting to see where it goes from here. The blacklist is surely on the top of my "watchlist" :)
