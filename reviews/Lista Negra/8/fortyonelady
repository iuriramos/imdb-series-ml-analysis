Anything with the Spade-Man is good to me! It not Boston Legal and if you compare it to that then sure--you will be disappointed. 

After-all, no one can beat a Shatner/Spader combination.

Is the acting bad? Um..not really. Is some of the dialog predictable yep. Again...it's new. 

Some aloof person mentioned that a child with a bomb strapped to them is uhh...brutal. First off the show is about criminals and terrorist. None of which are fluffy and sweet in nature. Their job is to destroy lives. 

I guess what I don't understand is that you want more realistic dialog, excellent actors but false situations and plots. That's...unrealistic. Retarded even. 

Gimme a break.
