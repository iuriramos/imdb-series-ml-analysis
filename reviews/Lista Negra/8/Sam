Watched 10 episodes of The blacklist now and this is one of the best series i have seen.

James Spader plays the lead role Raymond "Red" Reddington and he does a very good job.

Megan Boone plays the rookie agent Elizabeth Keen. She is an FBI profiler and the only one to whom Red talks. She does an OK job.

I like the story very much and recommend you to watch the series

If i have to tell one thing that i don't like it is that the special effect that are being used are very bad. I have seen better special effects in 10 year old movies. I hope they do something about that now that the series is doing so good.
