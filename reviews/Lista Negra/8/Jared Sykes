The Blacklist was a great show when it started up. The super hyped pilot was very imaginative and enjoy full, andmI hoped that the other episodes would be like it. There is good acting and the overall plot is great. James Spader plays such a good, unique role that I don't think anyone else could have done better.Sadly, I got quite bored during the latter episodes of season one. They have good ideas for episodes every now and then, and it is a great show currently, but I honestly don't know how they'll keep on coming up with ideas for further seasons. Anyway, my 8 out of 10 goes to good acting, especially Spader's role, good idea and cool music.
