(May contain spoilers) I'm new to the series

one of the best shows i've seen in a long while 

about a criminal (former navy was groomed to be admiral) who escapes the f.b.i for years hands himself in and demands to only to speak with rookie f.b.i agent elizabeth liz keen (who doesn't know why he picked her, but it's obvious that red knows her somehow . together they form a task force to capture criminals who the f.b.i does not know about (Red picks the criminals HENCH The Blacklist) who seems to be connected to each other in a bigger plot .

i've watched the whole season 1 TWICE within a month lol somehow the first season pretty good especially the bromance relationship between red ( James spader) & agent ressler ( Diego Klattenhoff ) BEST PARTS of season 1 is their parts on the show i think if i'm honest the reason why i even continued to watch season 2 red & ressler . It's taken me some time to warm up to agent keen character ( Megan boone)she's FAR better in season 2 than in season 1 i absolutely hate her husband character tom keen (Ryan Eggold) why is he even still on the show in season 2? after their sham of a marriage in season 1 

I LOVE these epidoes ( Best epidoes of season 1 in my opinion are) 

pilot, The Stewmaker , The Courier, Mako Tanida , Anslo Garrick ( Part 1) MY ALL TIME FAV of the entire eps of the show . ( So much warmth and energy went into making that episode and to show the best parts of red to save a man who hates him Anslo Garrick ( Part 2) , The Pavlovich Brothers Gina Zanetakos

I've not seen all of season 2 yet i got up to tom keen episode as i decide to re-watch season 1 lol as i said it's addictive and i couldn't wait for the next episode to air 

Best epidoes of season 2 ( of what i've seen) 

Luther Braxton part 1 & 2 The Kenyon Family The Mombasa Cartel Ruslan Denisov Tom Keen 

ALSO The character Aram Mojtabai (Amir Arison) he is pretty funny and should get more air time & Dembe (Hisham Tawfiq) should get more air time too shame they killed Meera Malik (Parminder Nagra) off i also liked her character not too keen on the women who replaced her tho
