Now this ladies and gentlemen is how you make a great interesting Television Show. 

The Blacklist is one of these rare days where you can get people's attention with story telling and a strong performance by the lead actors.

The show centers around The F.B.I. most wanted criminal who sudden surrender himself, this man is Raymond 'Red' Reddington played by James Spader. 

But Red has his reason for turning himself in, he helps the FBI find the criminals that they didn't know they were looking for. However to gain the information of these criminals Red would only speak with Elizabeth Keen F.B.I. Newest Agent.

There is a lot of mystery to why Red would surrender to help the F.B.I. and it leads to wonder why he would only speak with Elizabeth. 

But as the series goes on it is suspicious to think that Reddington knows a lot more about Elizabeth than one might suspect. 

Many episodes can blow your mind away some can be too extreme but never the less The Blacklist is one show that many people are enjoying today and for good reason it has a interesting plot with a strong lead actor in James Spader. James Spader was born for the role of Raymond 'Red' Reddington. It's clear when you watch the show you see why James is the right actor for Red. Megan Boone was about to give up acting until she won the part of Elizabeth Keen and so far she brings the character power. With a little faith and a lot of Luck Megan will get more roles.

So far the two lead protagonists make the show interesting with good writing and performance between the two. 

So far we have been given two well done seasons and I just learn NBC is given the Blacklist a Third Season.

So check out the Blacklist you won't regret it
