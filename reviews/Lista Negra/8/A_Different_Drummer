We are in the age of TV Release 2, a new style of production and writing marking the biggest "leap" the medium has taken since it started in the 50s. The precise origins are a matter of some conjecture, but for purposes of this humble review, let's says the evolutionary arc goes something like this: Buffy -- BSG -- Sopranos -- Breaking Bad -- Person of Interest. Just sayin'.

This tasty little delight combines some of the most interesting aspects of Silence of the Lambs (Hello Clarice!) along with the odd-duck pairings of X-Files and Fringe, by way of the weekly "rescue" arc in POI.

Not to say that it is derivative, merely that the writing team doesn't miss much. Which is to their credit.

Spader is gem. Looking back at his early work, it is not impossible to see signs of his current character here and there, but the length of the jump is still a sight to behold.

More fun than a barrel of hammers.
