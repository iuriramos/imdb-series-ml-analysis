Pros: 1. James Spader

Cons: 1. Not the best characters & storyline

Inference: 1. James spader is beyond belief, definitely pulls off half the ratings of the show all alone on his shoulders. Amazes me that he never made it big on the big screen, his small screen performances have been stellar to say the least.

2. The show is watchable, but only if you are not looking for tight, realistic story. It does pass the time, never gets boring, acceptable story & characters.

3. In short, other than Spader, the show scrapes through. Could have done with a 'stronger, dominating, bitchy' female lead and more 'held together' storyline
