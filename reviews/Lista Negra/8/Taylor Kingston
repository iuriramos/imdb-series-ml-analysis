I love this show. I know it's only been going for two seasons, as of right now, but I think it is very good. It is completely different to any other crime or FBI shows out right now. The story lines are so well thought out and the cast portray their characters very well. I love the relationships between the characters and the never answered question (as of half way through Season 2): Is Reddington Liz's Father? I don't know!

This show is about a man, a criminal, Raymond Reddington, turns himself into the FBI after them hunting him for years. But he comes with a twist. He wants to be let free in exchange for him helping them track down criminals they didn't even know existed. Very serious and dangerous criminals that threaten all areas of life. And Reddington will only talk to Elizabeth Keen, an agent assigned to The Blacklist Task Force.

Overall, I give this TV show an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.
