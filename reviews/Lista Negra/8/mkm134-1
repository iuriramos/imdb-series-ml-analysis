I absolutely love this show, it's suspenseful and entertaining. My only issue is with Liz. As the show continues I've started liking Red more and liking Liz less. She's just so whiny and annoying. She's extremely self absorbed and narcissistic, like her life and job is more important than anything or anyone else. Plus it bothers me that the dog is in some episodes but than is never heard from. What kind of dog owners are they that they don't care for it at all?! Once you get past Liz's shortfalls, the show is great! I'm looking forward to watching the new season and seeing what twists and turns the writers will think of next especially with Red. Even though he's an evil mastermind, James Spader plays the character so well that you just have to love him. I'm hoping he gets the Emmy because his acting abilities have only gotten better with time. It's like this role was made for him.
