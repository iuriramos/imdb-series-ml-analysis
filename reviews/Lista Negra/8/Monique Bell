James Spader does a really great job in this role. He keeps the show going. The supporting actors are also good. Megan Boone, on the other hand, makes me cringe. She always makes me think about who could have played this role better. Sanaa Lathan comes to mind. 

There are a few back stories that are interesting. Harry Linnex has a great back story. I'm still trying to figure out where his story is going. Another favorite character is Red's cleaner. She's ruthless and mysterious. 

Overall, great show if you can tolerate an intolerable leading lady. :/ For instance, the way she performs scenes are not convincing. Her facial expressions are weird and awkward. Even her script. Sometimes I wonder if they purposely make her script worse than everyone else's or does she ad-lib. Well, I don't know. I'm waiting for the day she's replaced so that I can really enjoy the show!
