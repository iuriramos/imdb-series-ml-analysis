A series which I initially thought was just going to be a series of unrelated episodes more or less, with the main story falling in the background, but boy was I surprised, when it developed, and kudos for the development in the end of season 2. This is just a very strong series, with wonderful performance of James Spader as Reddington, without him the show would collapse. It is a pleasure to see, really strong show I recommend anyone to see. Initially I cooled down a little bit when watching it, after the first two episodes it began to have a little bit of "ground hog day" over it. So I actually left the series for a couple of months, came back to it, and I was sold. Strong, strong story and I had more than one night where I could not stop at the time I should have stopped.
