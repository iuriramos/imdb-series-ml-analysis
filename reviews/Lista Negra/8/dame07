After finding the trailer I saw that James Spader was starring so I decided to check it out. I don't usually watch crime dramas but this one has kept me hooked. Raymond "Red" Reddington brings mischief and mystery which will leave you wondering. The acting from Spader is brilliant and he really fits well within the show. On the other hand, Megan Boone doesn't really bring much to the show. Her character is quite dull and boring. After watching the first 10 episodes we start to see that some of the characters are connected in some way or other, but very little has been given away at this point in the series. I'm hoping they don't drag it on and that we find out how there all connected in the 2nd series. The only thing that's annoying about the show is that the FBI has been made out to be dumb as reddington out smarts them nearly every episode. Overall, it's a great little series and I will continue watching it as the mystery unfolds..
