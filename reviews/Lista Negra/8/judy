Blacklist got off to a good start, but like so many TV series like this we'll have to see where it goes. I like James Spader (even though he's gotten fat and seems to be hanging around William Shatner too much), he creates a really creepy character in Red. I also like how the show got off to a quick start but like all of these "everything is a mystery" shows it will only be as good as the next episode. I do think that the violence was a little much, but I did like the female heroine and I really want to see what happens to her and her husband. Like the Following this show will only be as good as it's lead characters so I hope that they keep the dialog crisp and the plot actually going somewhere that we want to go and not just into some ridiculous nowhere land that we don't care about. We will see.
