I am a relative newcomer to the show, so I might not have all the data to make an accurate assessment. With that being said, I can make an honest assessment about the few episodes I watched. James Spader is awesome as Raymond 'Ray' Remington. The character is definitely an attention-getter in a very squishy-scary sort of way. His demeanor send chills up my spine, goosebumps on my arms and my skin just plain crawls. If he is speaking to you in a sensible, calm and logical mannerit seems to indicate your days are numbered. If you are no longer usefulwellyou are gone. If you mess with 'Ray', his friends or Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone)  just say TATA  and lights are out for you. Sapder has this character down to a frightening 'T'. And even if Ms. Boone is a quasi-rookieshe is a fast learner. She is rapidly learning not to buy any of those bridges to nowhere  and she does not take any doo-doo from anyoneincluding Remington. I can see why many critics think this show rehashes old storiesand to some extentI have to agree. That is probably why I avoided "The Blacklist" for such a long time  I was getting tired of shows copying other shows  some of whom, in the same week. I have to give kudos to the outstanding job done by the cast, crew and writers. Even if there are similarities between this show and othersthere is enough suspense to keep me in the game. I like the show and now I must catch up with the rest of you fansgood choice.
