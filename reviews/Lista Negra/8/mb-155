Now this is very well done. James Spader is perfect. Could not believe he was the same actor as the first sneezing Daniel Jackson in Stargate. He is very versatile. In this he has something in common with Daniel Day-Lewis. Also very importantly and listen to this please directors and actors he speaks fairly slowly and clearly. You can hear his excellent lines without having to spend eons of time fiddling with equipment to get rid all the background noise/music. If a writer is going to produce brilliant stories like with this drama, get actors that can deliver the lines properly! Why is it so much of an actors voice is lost when they speak too fast or slur. Can only hope the scripts continue to be excellent. Megan Boone is pretty (the right word) good too though hasn't 'Red' done enough to get a tiny fraction of appreciation from her.
