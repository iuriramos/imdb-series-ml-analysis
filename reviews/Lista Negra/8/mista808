James Spader is an amazing actor. I love him in this show and if he were not a part of the cast then I would probably rate this show a 6 or 7 instead of an 8. At times the plots are a bit corny but the show always has me coming back for more. 

It does start off a little slow but quickly turns up the heat after a few episodes. If you're into crime thrillers than give this show a go and don't bother with the very few who say it's terrible. It's a very good show that seems to get better and better with each episode!

If you enjoyed Dexter, Breaking Bad and shows of that genre. Then you'll most likely enjoy this new series.
