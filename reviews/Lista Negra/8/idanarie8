*This review is based on the first episode only* The Black List could become one of the greatest shows of the year, but they fail to do that because of some bad choices: 1. The actors can't act! all of them are really bad besides James Spader that gives this show like 50% of the audience. 2. No Authentic! Elizabeth wakes up in the morning with, of course, a FULL MAKEUP all over her face. -Yeah right. 3. The cops, sorry not cops, FBI! are so dumb! Of course, as always the criminal is a master mind but the FBI have to be so stupid! why every show or movie makes the same mistake?! 4. kitsch, kitsch, kitsch! Little girl gives her necklace away to some woman she just met, "will they hurt me?" Comeon! It's 2013 enough with that! There are many more issues I could bring up but I'll stop here. I'm gonna keep watching it but this show has more potential than it's final result. 6/10 for the first episode.
