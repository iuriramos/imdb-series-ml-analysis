james spader as raymond reddington is smart . Elizabeth keen is endearing . The relationship between elizabeth & her husband is irritating to audience . Meera malik and others are gritty . Reddington guides them to catch criminal by making them think like criminal not cops . He is cruel for his enemies . He does not show emotions but you can feel his effort to look undisturbed by events affecting those he loves . There are few laughs in serious situation due to reddington's reaction . Nowadays TV serial makers make movie-like scenes eg.- plane falling , train derailing etc. This serial is about behaviour of different kinds of people not about technical jargon of operation .
