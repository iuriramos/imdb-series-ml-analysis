The Blacklist is definitely in my weekly rotation. James Spader creates an exceptional leading character - hilarious quirkiness layered over a sinister interior. Plot is fast paced with the cast chasing a new villain every week.

The only issue I have is with Diego Klattenhoff as Agent Ressler, who gets significant air time every episode. His acting quality is at the level of a bad high school play. In many scenes his acting is so poor it's laughable - have to ignore him to enjoy the episode. He was passable in Homeland, but is horrendous in Blacklist.

Other than that, Blacklist is fun, well written escapism - and keeps you guessing enough on the recurring background themes to hold your attention.
