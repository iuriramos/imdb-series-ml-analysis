James Spader does of course (well at least for me) 'carry' the series. Its not that he's some 'screen god' (he's not), but he delivers his lines with a convincing 'coolness' which, when added to the screenwriters quirky wit blends to create a performance which I find enjoyable. 

As with Hamilton's review (above .. or below .. depending where this ends up) I agree that the performance of much of the remaining cast is a little 'flat' and which seems a shame (although a great platform for promoting Spader's talent).

Continuing the criticism; the storyline which applies to the eventual apprehension of the various 'blacklisters' is a little too simplistic and I would prefer the 'connecting' one one or more episodes with a longer more involved (and believable) plot than the wrap-it-up in 50mins scenario being offered.

And finally (on criticisms) we are being led along this path of seeming obscurity when it comes to Red's relationship with Elizabeth but .. I am certain that from the very first episode it was clear that we are being set-up for Red to eventually be disclosed as Elizabeth's father .. indeed the set-up seems a little too obvious!

Overall, a great little series made so (for me .. and as mentioned) by the perfect casting selection which put Spader in the role of 'Red' Reddington!
