I'm currently on Episode 18, Season 1 as I'm watching on Netflix. James Spader is a great casting selection, Boone is alright, barely fuckable, they could have gone with a prettier choice, as of the other cast members they are solid. The idea for this series is a exciting one, the Blacklist was much hyped and I didn't fell for it in the first few episodes. The turnover begins with the anslo garrick Episodes, them and the further episodes really get The Blacklist going. Negative aspects are the digital Special Effects, especially the explosions are some of the worst looking there are and some pathos filled scenes. The concept is interesting, remains to be seen how much they can get out of it
