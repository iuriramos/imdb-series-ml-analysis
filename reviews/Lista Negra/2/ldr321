The premise of the main story line is ridiculous: This super agent/double agent easily is able to pull the wool over the eyes of the FBI time and time again. He's let out to do some work for them, he escapes. Where is he? He is back in custody. He's let out, again, he escapes---Where is he? Gimme a damn break! If the FBI was actually that stupid, collectively, how could it function, at all? The woman who plays the main female agent cannot act, and it's painful to watch her try. Spader took the part because he was well-paid to do so, and he hasn't been doing too much, since BL ended. I tried to like this thing, because I'm a Spader fan, but I found myself laughing out loud during the first show. Watching the next two shows was all I could stomach. It's bad stuff, sorry to say. Bad acting, bad writing----just bad, all the way around.
