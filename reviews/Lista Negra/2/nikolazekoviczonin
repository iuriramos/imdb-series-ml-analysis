It is really beyond me how some movies or TV shows have this high rating, and i am afraid that world is really getting dumper so film makers just make what people are buying and that would be predictable boring shows like this one. And beside holes in scenario and all flaws in movie itself dude the main actress can not act at all. She isn't capable of showing any emotion whatsoever, like none of them really, no sadness no fear no happiness, literally anything except that half- smile resting b.tch (but high-school b.tch) face. I think its not a spoiler for police action show so i'll add little example- when psycho torturer and murder catches her and her face is like its her mom catching her stealing candies. When she acts to be in big big pain suffering torture her face is like she again her mom catch her eating cake late night. Even producers noticed it i think so they would zoom out camera when she screams or something because its really looks so unconvincing that is ridiculous. She is cute face, but come on, give her to play some high-school girl in some romantic comedy or something, because she really destroyed already shaky story. No character development, nothing, i cared more when some random murder gets killed than if she died during the show. I don't know should i believed in that stories that i see on net about companies paying IMDb and similar review sites to push movie or show when is needed or its overall population just so shallow that any piece of cr.p can be sold on screens but Blacklist having a single point over 5 maybe is unreal really. I will not recommend to not watch it, it is watchable if you really have nothing else to do or see, but just like some of CSI shows, week by week of simple, predictable, shallow cases that are solved without any effort or tension or viewers attachment to any of character (except male lead role, he did a very good job but its simply not enough to save this sh.t.- That is Blacklist for me.
