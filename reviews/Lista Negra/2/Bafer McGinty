Loud, overblown, shouty, loaded to the brim with music beds, no light & shade, fatuous dialogue, clunky exposition - even the talented James Spader can't save this network attempt to polish a turd. I'm sure a treatment of The Blacklist could look fantastic: lots of action, intrigue, suspense and drama. But the heavy- handedness in every aspect of the production left me throbbing and begging for a peaceful moment. 

I stuck with it for as long as possible, but once I turned an episode off, it was very difficult to turn it back on again. Spader does his smarmy, self-satisfied best with what he's been given - the same cannot be said of any one of the regular supporting cast, especially Megan Boone, whose histrionics are hewn straight from the 'Claire Danes in Homeland' playbook. I'm hugely surprised it's been as well-received here and elsewhere. Network drama has fallen well behind even the most middling of cable and on-demand programs - and is not even in the same zipcode as recent dramas like Thrones, Fargo or Better Call Saul.
