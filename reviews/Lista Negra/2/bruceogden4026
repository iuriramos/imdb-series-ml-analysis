Blacklist is no longer on my DVR list. NCIS is the gold standard of long lived shows, however, despite a strong beginning the Blacklist has lost its legs.2013 was a great season. The story line and premise was solid and entertaining with interesting characters. 2014 is moving from drama to comedy. Characters are losing their depth and becoming caricatures. David Spade and his portrayal of the world's worst villain with a heart of gold has been enjoyable but the dramatic pauses and smirks have become predictable. Agent Keen has lost the vulnerable "little girl" persona and is morphing into a GI Jane. David Spade now appears tired of his role and Red looks tired of life. It is time to move on.
