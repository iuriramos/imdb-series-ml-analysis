I saw the whole season 1 i was very interested den but as it continued it seems so pathetic !!!

Whereas i don't know y but i find the storyline of BLINDSPOT as compared to dis , a bit fascinating (Well of course acting needs to be improved). Sorry, people but i don't find James spader as Outstanding here as u all say whereas the female lead is worthless. 

But i have to say the pilot was exquisite !!!!

Overall , On a scale of 1 to 10 its 4 from my side.

I really hope that season 3 of this show goes well !!! 

But , I AM BLACKLISTING THE BLACKLIST FROM MY WATCHLIST !!!!!
