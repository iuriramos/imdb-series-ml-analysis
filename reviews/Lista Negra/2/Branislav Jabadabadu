Watching the show has led to questions about why this is written, and for whom? Uneducated children under 13 years old, or that children understand that it is normal to become mistreated by the Government!?

About the show: Silence of the Lambs - really, copy something else for a change?

The main character first do the right thing, cast a weapon in order to preserve human life, then her boss say she should not have. Next time kill the villain who is and is not (a classic Hollywood plot, by the way), and a child who he is trying to save. WTF! The Chinese have become the new foreign villains (the Russians now only sell nuclear weapon, via Cuba of course), the domestic enemies - all Americans, or 99%. People who fight for the rights against corporations and government for the benefit of all are ruthlessly persecuted. Serbian terrorists - someone heard that some Serb planted a bomb somewhere or hijacked plane in real life - not? Only in the movies. Show is full of Hollywood clich√©s and unrealistic events, I know that this is a TV but ... a little common sense, for God's sake. The CIA and FBI have no idea what is going on, and they are totally incompetent, but... they are cool... somehow. This is the first thing that came to mind, and could continue to add much more.

The sad thing is that I love this type of shows. Please make at least one that is good... please!
