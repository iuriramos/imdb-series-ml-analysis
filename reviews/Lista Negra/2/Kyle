Never seen the show sober but I've got a friend that won't shut up about it. Makes me want to drink even more.

Also, feel like like this is just a government conspiracy to make us alright with the stuff that already happens. Kind of like a gateway drug into the hard stuff. The hard government stuff. That's what she said. 

I read a Wikipedia article about government conspiracies once so I would consider myself somewhat of an expert. Maybe like 80% expert level? I'm not saying I could debate with OBAMA about how Blacklist is a red herring but Joe Biden for sure. 

Gave it two stars because the lead actress is pretty cute.
