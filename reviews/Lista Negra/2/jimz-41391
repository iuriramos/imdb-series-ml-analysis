I was really looking forward to the show. Thought the premise was terrific. But the execution was simply awful, I couldn't make it all the way through the first episode. When will writers learn to stop making shows that utterly lack credibility. 

When in the first few minutes of the first episode you try to apprehend a desperado indoors by drawing guns and **getting in a CIRCLE** around him with drawn weapons, I wonder exactly who you are going to shoot ?

Sadly, that was not the only, nor even the most egregious straining of credibility. It went downhill from there very fast. Not sure if it ever bottomed out, couldn't make it more than 17 minutes into episode 1.

I honestly hope there were not any actual law enforcement involved as technical advisers to this show. There is dramatic license, and then there is dramatic grand-theft.

On the other hand, if you don't know a thing about law-enforcement, anti- terrorism, tactics, or firearms, perhaps you'll enjoy the drama without laughing over and over again.
