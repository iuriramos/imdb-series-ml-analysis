The good ratings for Blacklist piqued my interest and I decided giving the series a try. But I couldn't bring myself to watch more than the first three episodes of season 1.

What I hoped for: to be entertained by a unique kind of thriller/crime story.

What I got: a clich√©-ridden mess that had me shaking my head in disbelief more and more until I stopped the third episode around 32 or 35 minutes.

James Spader plays just as great as always but everyone else barely raises above mediocre acting talent. Even a High School acting group can do better than this.

I gave this uninspired disaster a 2/10 - only for Spader's performance.

The idea of a high-profile criminal to turn into an "informant with benefits" and telling the FBI what to do when, where and how could've been mane into a decent 90-minutes flick. Hell, even Star Trek worked - for generations (no pun intended). Blacklist, however, must've been written by amateurs. Or as a fanfic parody like 50 Shades of Grey or something.

Avoid at all costs.
