I really wanted to like this series and the storyline sounded good. However, if you like good series, such as the Danish masterpieces "The Killing" and "The Bridge", or great acting as in "True Detective", human and believable characters such as in "Spiral", etc. do not waste your time on The Blacklist. The story is very badly told and not believable (on her first day at work at the FBI the main actress is already taking all the decisions and not advised or supervised. Really??? Furthermore, the direction is bad, the and the main actress horrible. A waste of time and definitely not worth watching. Next. Unless you are looking for a light predictable Hollywood type of series.
