Having seen James Spader back in Stargate (1994), this was the one and only time I'd seen him. Fast-forward 20 years and WOW!!! With Sky box-sets, I generally download the pilot and then use my own judgement, not fair I guess but I do use IMDb as a springboard. However though, this time I downloaded the first 10 episodes and my god I was hooked. I started watching at 1am GMT and finished the first 10 at 7am and proceeded to download the remaining 12 episodes.

I really mean it when I say - "you won't be disappointed". THIS IS NOT A SPOILER but that opening sequence will have you riveted to your TV I promise. All the actors play their parts very very well and not least James Spader. Each episode is mind-blowing and leads directly to the next flawlessly. Download now - don't wait.
