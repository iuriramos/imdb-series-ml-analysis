I really like the premise of this show - it allows for a lot of opportunity for creative ideas, guest cameos as well as incorporating relevant topics of the day - (such as security issues we face in our country). But I have to say, the female lead, Megan Boone...her interaction with Mr. Spader is so acerbic that her performance comes off palpable - you feel the hatred emanating from her. It's as if she's not "acting" the hatred - it comes off too genuine. Is she thinking she should be the lead and Mr. Spader just an accessory? Her acting range is weak and repetitive. I liked her in the first season - but now I can barely stand to watch any episodes. I wish you'd either get rid of her or change the direction of her role - but it's literally killing the series.
