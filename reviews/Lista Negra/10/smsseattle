Just found this series and watched all the episodes. The Blacklist is one of the best written shows of this kind I have seen to date. Breaking Bad was great, Justified was great, but the persona of Raymond Red Reddington with his great vocabulary and gestures is just mind blowing. James Spader has found his character in this show and I am hooked. I love the supporting cast. They all have that unusual look that a character actor has to have to fit the part perfectly. The writing and vocabulary that Reddington uses shows that the writer (Jon) has really developed a character with a great actor in mind who can convincingly draw you into every detail. It is a condition of falling in love with the bad guy as he seems to try in some way to redeem himself, but maybe with a hidden agenda, and protect Elizabeth Keen for some reason. We will find out why at some point I am sure. I also think who ever has charge of the music score is in the right place, keep it up. They can take this series all the way to world domination, and this can almost be believable the way or governments work now. I can only hope this will run a long time. Love it and I am picky when it come to writing, acting and all the pieces it takes to produce a winner. 10 out of 10
