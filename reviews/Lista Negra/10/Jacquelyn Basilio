James Spader is an amazingly talented actor. I know I maybe young but thanks to technology I have been able to view some of his many movies and let me tell you if you did not know, Boy is he Amazing! Sometimes finding an actor who can play a so called "antagonist" who is intelligent and a tad bit cocky but you love to love can be difficult. Especially when he has the characteristics of Raymond 'Red' Reddington but James Spader plays the perfect bad/good guy and his subtle facial expressions embodies the mysterious bad guy to perfection. This show is truly gripping with its characters and suspense filled episode. I hope it lives for the next decade and more so that we can see the life, story and relationship unfold between the characters. It is a Definite Must See.
