How utterly refreshing to see a new intelligent show in this fall lineup!! I had SO missed James Spader since Boston Legal ended and was hoping and praying this new show would live up to his past excellent performances - and it does - and then some!! There are so few shows that come out these days that are not the same ol cookie cutter no brain mindless entertainment drivel that describes about 90% of anything on a network channel. The Blacklist; at least the pilot - proves to be anything but. Well written, fast paced, intelligent dialog, great acting by Spader - a breath of fresh air. Thank you Joe Bokenkamp for creating something to look forward to on television!
