Witty, offbeat and absolutely engrossing! James Spader's (Reddington) acting is brilliant! Every small gesture and facial expression, which he makes, are building his character. Even though every episode has its own story, all the series - combined are one big puzzle, which can't be fully pieced until the very last episode. I enjoyed watching it and I strongly recommend it to everyone! At times the action is on the border with fiction, but it's not that irritating, conspicuous or tawdry. The plot is interesting, the actors are marvelous, the music is enchanting and influential. I'm thinking about re-watching it once again, now, what all makes sense to me!
