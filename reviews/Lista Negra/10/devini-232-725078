In this time of (non)reality TV, true acting is being replaced with bumbling, drunkin', spoiled, illiterate, idiots lacking in morality and intestinal fortitude, not to mention talent less hacks. It's so enjoyable watching people with real talent entertain us. Those that have spend years developing their craft such as the actors and writers of the Blacklist. James Spader delivers on the promise of a character who keeps us unsettled and intrigued as to his next move and motivation. Boone keeps us on the edge of our seat as to what is happening in her mind. We are always left wondering about Spader and Boones' true relationship and history. I hope this series has a long long long life and hopefully this is a start to the end of (non) reality television which so many of us have become bored with. I no desire to peer into the lives of those that have no morality, or talent or anything else to offer. It's time for talent to take over the airwaves again and leave the immoral, illiterate no-names in the past.
