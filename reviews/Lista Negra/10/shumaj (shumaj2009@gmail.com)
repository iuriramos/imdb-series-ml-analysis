during these years from 2010 to now, we have watched the masterpieces in TV Shows such as The blacklist, Person of Interest, The Walking Dead, Penny Dreadful, House of Cards, True Detective and etc. we must look past the other disgusting TV Shows which were being watched by the mass such as Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones and etc. I do not know how the TV owners are looking for to absorb the mass as their viewers! They do not see that after the series like The Blacklist many of the Cinema viewers are now before the televisions to watch the fallen of Hollywood! So, please do not watch the votes for the absurd and ridiculous series like Game of Thrones and please and please concentrate on producing the Blacklist and all the themes like this(I mean a strong work with strong dialogs and strong persona's).
