I feel one individuals review about the lead actress is undue the criticism doled out. All actors/actresses have their merit and bring their individual quality to the show. James is magnificent and the lead actress fits her role pretty well. Considering in real life I could see her jabbing a pen into someone's neck if she was not satisfied with the answers she was looking for. The previous review writer chunter76422 was not looking at talent but something else, not sure what?? The individuals that play the roles they do, associate with their characters and adapt them well. The Blacklist is an excellent show with many great talents old and emerging. Anyone with talents sense would know that and applaud the capabilities.
