This show is the best show on TV right now.The story line is just wonderful and the writing is perfect,no doubt The Blacklist has many mysteries (mostly about Red) and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I've been following this show since season 1 and it hasn't let me down! It's only getting better and better! Oh my goodness this is amazing. You have to watch it!For woman; Megan Boone is a lovely and strong character that girls and woman need in this day and age.She's confident,has struggles,but gets through it because she's tough and becomes a bad-A in the later seasons!And Lady's *wink* *wink* Ressler is hot. If you are older,however,you might find Red more pleasing. Although I think Ressler has those back in the day handsome looks anyway. For men; Lot's of action,(but not mindless action!)and killing but not too much gore.Keen (Megan Boone) is very pretty. And it's a very exciting show to watch. For the kids; I'm not sure if you'd want your kids watching this or not because of the violence but as for anything sexual there was only two (maybe three) scenes of sexual content throughout the whole seasons. It's very good. Not over the top but great television! A must watch!
