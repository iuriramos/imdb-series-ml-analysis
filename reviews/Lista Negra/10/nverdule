Let me tell you me and my husband were waiting for this show to premiere it actually premiered on my birthday, well my husband was more hyped about it from the commercials. Boy let me tell you it did not disappoint us this show kept us on our toes. I felt like I was in interrogation room. I felt every emotion it was a great 1st episode and cant wait for episode 2. From reading some of the reviews some people are being too critical about the small stuff just enjoy the show. It's not going to be perfect that's why it is a TV show and not a documentary. It's still brand new and still developing. But for my husband and I this is our new favorite show. I now have something to look forward to watch on Mondays!
