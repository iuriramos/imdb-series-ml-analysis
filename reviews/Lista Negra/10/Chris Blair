One of the best shows I have watched in quite some time. Spader plays the character exceptionally well and the supporting cast, while nowhere near as perfectly acted, is definitely growing in to its' own. The story has the perfect amount of suspense to keep you wanting more whilst keeping you engaged and never boring you. 

Although some complain that the manipulation of the FBI is over the top etc, you have to ask if that is really true, and if so, does it really matter. The manipulation helps make Red seem like the absolute BAMF that we've all always wanted to be. 

20 stars.
