The Blacklist is excellent. James Spader deserves an Emmy Award for his role in this show. James Spader you have made this the show to watch - brilliant and it's on everyone's list! 10/10 - just perfect. I have not paid attention to James Spader's acting in the past but now I will be watching everything which he has acted in. The show starts with such intensity and throughout the episodes the connection which Red (James Spader) has with the other actors in The Blacklist becomes more intriguing and leaves you trying to work out what the real connections are. Lizzy and Red's connection takes many paths and I think we will see in the next season more revealed and it certainly will not be what we think. James Spader - perfect casting for this show, no other actor could have played this part like you - :)
