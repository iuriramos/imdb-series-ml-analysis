I can't even begin to express the joy I feel when I watch this show. Every episode my wife and I turn the surround on, turn the lights off, make popcorn, and cuddle on the couch to watch it like a movie. I get butterflies when I see a blacklist in my list of recorded shows and watch it as soon as possible to assist in positive ratings, we're always eager to watch the next episode. The plot is beyond amazing, and is reminiscent of the TV Show Lost in terms of mystery and suspense, with the exception of how lost failed me in the end. I can only hope that this show only continues in the right direction. No one could have played Raymond Reddington better than James Spader, or Elizabeth Keen once Megan Boone, and Tom Keen, rather not spoil it, but Ryan EggoldÂ… Never heard of him before to be honest, however Just like James and Megan, Ryan could have not been a better pick for the part! I write this review to simply express another fans insurmountable pleasure with the show and cast and hopes that it continues to be picked up for more seasons and maintain positive ratings, I share these thoughts with anyone I can when TV show topics come up, in hopes that its fan base can grow even larger as it deserves! I give this show 10 out of 10!
