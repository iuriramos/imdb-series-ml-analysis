In a show so over the top, Mr. Spader brings complexity, depth, intelligence, humor, authenticity and sublime sensibility. His presence is powerful and palpable.

Truly as with fine wine, with age Spader has honed his craft and observing him is interesting, engaging, surprising.

I do not watch TV--don't even own one and have found myself riveted and fascinated by the full richness James Spader brings to life.

A masterful surprise........the beautiful young man become a seasoned,gorgeous man. 

Beautiful, a joy and delight to relish!
