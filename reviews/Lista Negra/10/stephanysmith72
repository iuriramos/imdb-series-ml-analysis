The Blacklist still rocks!!! RED is the MAN!! Spader is so awesome in this role..His best ever! Hope the show continues on for many more seasons. We need quality shows like this one. So far with the new fall shows I haven't been impressed. And with Criminal Minds and NCIS not being what they used to be, I am glad to see that Blacklist is still going strong. Love this show still! I would like for Tom/Liz and baby to have some peace. Poor Agnes hasn't had a peaceful day in her short little life. Back to the new episode...No spoilers here but its worth watching and letting Blacklist keep you on the seat of your pants each week this fall. I will have to say, that BULL was actually pretty good but I miss Weatherly on NCIS.
