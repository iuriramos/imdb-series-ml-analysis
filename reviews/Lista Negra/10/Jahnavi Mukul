This is my new favorite show. I love James Spader. His sarcasm and his and his one liners are AWESOME. The way he insulted the FBI by calling their Top Ten Most Wanted List 'A POPULARITY CONTEST'was mind blowing. Megan Boone is charismatic and has a little more heart than I thought She would have. Some people are just cold hearted but she ain't. Every episode you begin to doubt Raymond but in the end you just love him the way you did before. I can't wait for the next episode and especially the reason why Reddington chose Elizabeth Keen. I also love the way he says in the pilot "I'm gonna make you famous Lizzie." It is really heart warming to see the connection between them. It sometimes makes my heart ache. I think Raymond is Keen's father or someone related to him. Otherwise he would not have known anything about her.
