The blacklist is one of those series that I bumped into while searching for top rated action titles on IMDb. While reading the plot; a fugitive spy, his return and his demand for a specific agent, all seemed liked a typical Hollywood popcorn flick, yet there was a USP. The USP was James Spader himself. His role as an antagonist was enough to tempt me watch this series as I was curious to see how a gentle looking actor would pull off such a role. I must say, I wasn't disappointed even for a second while watching the whole season. Believe me folks, even if you find the whole plot and its subplots boring, Spader's meticulous and extraordinary execution of his role as Red will be enough to keep you entertained and interested throughout the season.

I must say I had my doubts in Spader playing Ultron in the new Avengers movie, but after watching him play Red in The Blacklist, all my doubts have vanished.
