The Blacklist was created by Joe Bokenkamp and stars James Spader, Megan Boone and Jane Alexander.

The Blacklist is a thrilling series filled with action, suspense and mystery. The highlight though is the growing relationship between Red and Lizzie. Spader excels in the scenes where you can see through a look or an expression that Red cares about Lizzie a great deal.

FBI Agent Elizabeth Keen(Megan Boone)completes her training to become a profiler. On her first day in her new job wanted criminal mastermind Raymond Reddington(James Spader)hands himself in to the FBI. Red says he will speak only to Agent Keen.

There appears to be no connection between the two and Lizzie is certain she has never met him but he knows personal things about her that even her colleagues don't. Red informs the FBI that he has a list of dangerous criminals who are unknown to the Police or FBI. This list is known as The Blacklist. Red will share the names and details of their upcoming crimes only with Lizzie. Together they help bring these criminals to justice.

Red is one of the most interesting TV characters in a while, he's a skilled manipulator and a very clever man. He genuinely does seem to care about Lizzie. The most popular fan theory is that Red is Lizzie's father, there are many scenes between them that support that being a possibility. It's just as possible that Red knows or knew her father and is looking out for her for him. He may not actually care about her at all and she is just part of some bigger plan he has. Personally I hope he does have a personal connection to her or comes to care about her whilst working with her, the connection developing between them seems too genuine to be part of a larger plan that he has.

This is an excellent series with lots of twists, action and fascinating characters. The cast are all superb but the highlight is Spader, he is mesmerising as Red and steals every scene he is in.
