Th he Blacklist has already been disseminated and discussed herein quite sufficiently. But I might have something to add here. I watched Season 1 twice and encourage you to watch it again if you only watched it once. No spoilers, but knowing the finale, I found myself in tears many times the 2nd time around just knowing what was coming up. 

I also want to add that if the Emmys pass James Spader by on this one, I will forever lose faith in them. After 22 episodes, twice, there is no actor comparable to Mr. Spader as Red Reddington in The Blacklist. Also, I hope the show goes up and wins, yes, even against the absolute excellence of Game of Thrones! 

While the story itself isn't new to scripted television, what is new is the intelligence seen in every aspect of the story. The superb cast, the incredible writing and direction and production, and finally, the best season finale of any show in years!! This finale is not meant to be a cliffhanger, or a tease for the next season. It is a stand alone gift all wrapped up with the most perfect bow to the viewers. 

What differentiates The Blacklist from every other show is that it assumes its viewers are intelligent, average people who simply want spectacular entertainment at the end of a long day. And it delivers in such a humble, simple way, yet is jaw dropping in what it conveys. THIS is the show average viewers want. No hidden messages about politics, no big outrageous "look at me, aren't I the best" endings. Simple and subtle and not complicated yet total excellence. 

Looking forward to watching the next Emmys and the worthy Blacklist show and James Spader walking off the stage holding a well earned reward.
