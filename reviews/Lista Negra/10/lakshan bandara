One of the best shows that i'm currently watching. The story line is phenomenal, good casting, and gripping action throughout each episode, and I consider this show to be among the best shows such as(NCIS/The Mentalist/Supernatural/) looking forward to end of this season and the beginning of the next season. furthermore season so far has been phenomenal, and I personally like the mystery that are being build around Berlin, and how no one seems to understand about this secret, and who are they and how well connected could they be and the reason behind, why would they risk everything just to get caught by putting a sleeper inside one of their bargaining chip and most importantly why not take out the targets when they have a chance, and why are they operating on united states. i'm really looking forward to the answers.
