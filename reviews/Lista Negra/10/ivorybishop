Early in Spader's career, I will admit to not being his biggest fan. Over the years, this veteran actor has matured into a force to be reckoned with. The creator's of the show took a big risk partnering him with much younger actors, but they pull together to balance the scene stealing powerhouse that Spader brings to this show. 

In my humble opinion, the one younger star being overlooked and under- sung here, is Diego Klattenhoff. I was not crazy about his performance on Homeland, but recognized he was not given a great part, little screen time, or great writing in that show. But here, he takes what any other actor would have made a wooden character and turns in a performance that rivals that of anyone else on the show except Spader. Even in scenes involving Spader, he holds his own well. 

The show is fantastically written, the suspense is just right, no deus ex machina or other script writer BS. The show is flawless, the actors deliver gripping performances that draw you in a leave you breathless until the very end of the show. 

The only thing I can find negative about the show? It ends far too soon. I have few shows in my experience that make me sad to see end credits. 

Looking for a show that will deliver an awesome story line, drama that draws you in deep, and acting that rivals any show running today? The Blacklist delivers in spades.

10/10 is a score I give grudgingly at best to a TV show. This one deserves 11/10. It will not disappoint.
