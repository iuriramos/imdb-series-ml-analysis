Intriguing drama with an immensely talented cast. . If you want to see a gripping thriller with incredible characters you have come to the perfect place "The Blacklist" is one of the best series that i saw ever and James Spader with "Red" character is very amazing! i think he deserve an Emmy award for this character. and also the series has an absolutely gorgeous story and lots of excitement,action,romantic and drama in it. You can learn a lot from the story. A brilliant first season leaves me pining for more. The story has the potential to keep us guessing what is really going on for some time Excellent performance of the entire cast. One of the best series! I recommend it to all :)
