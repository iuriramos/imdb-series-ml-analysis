An excellent performance by James Spader, as Raymond 'Red' Reddington, alongside Megan Boone, Ryan Eggold, Harry Lennix and other great actors. I have really loved and enjoyed this show (even though some plot lines are possibly quite predictable) and the mini investigations each episode make a good addition to the main storyline. The character development throughout the show is great, not too slow moving but also not so fast that you lose track. Though it has only been going for 2 seasons so far, it feels like there has been a clear plot (unlike some shows where it seems like they make it up as they go) and many questions remain unanswered so I'm without doubt that the next season will be as great as the last. Overall it has been a very watchable and enjoyable series. I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys crime/action/romance type series, particularly shows such as Castle!!! 10/10
