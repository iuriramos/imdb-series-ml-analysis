I recently watched Boston Legal and I really like James Spader acting play. Then I start looking in what other movies/serials he plays and find this one. I decided to give it a chance and since i watched episode 1 the serial grab my attention. At the beginning it was just another serial but after a few episodes I assured myself that the serial is really good.

I think this serial will be the next hit on television like House M.D., Game of Thrones and so on. The serial is really interesting and it deserves your attention. After a few episodes you will continue watching with interest.
