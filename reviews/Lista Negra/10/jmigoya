this show is amazing, I saw the similarities between this show and the movie Silence of the Lambs immediately, I'm up to episode 4 and they just keep getting better, it's incredible how the silver screen movie and the small screen movie are almost indistinguishable from one another these days and that's a great thing, I've seen great new series this year that rival or even surpass big budget Hollywood movies and this show is a perfect example of that, it's the perfect plot and very plausible all you have to understand is that there are certain people walking around you and me daily that could be spies, killers, terrorists or even incredibly gifted manipulators in this show we get treated to a slew of all of the above and then some, cant say enough about the show other than, "James S. is back with a vengeance!" not that he was ever gone but this is EPIC!!!
