Raymond 'Red' Reddington is an INCREDIBLY interesting character and by far my favorite in the show and my second favorite overall, behind Gibbs (NCIS)

The criminals he baits out are interesting too. I've been waiting for a good show where criminals actually commit their acts. I've seen a few, but not to the extent of some of the ones in this show. CSI NY/NCIS you see it, but it's only ever at the start in most episodes then it's the team solving it. 

Anyway, because of this I'll always remember Season 1, Episode 7, Frederick Barnes (No.47), I was watching it and thought "Ahh, he won't be killing anyone. The other side will get there a split second before like most other shows and movies and stop him" but I'm happy to admit I was VERY wrong.

Definitely give this show a chance if you haven't already. I personally loved it and watched season 1 and 2 back to back over a weekend haha. Haven't done that since NCIS ^.^
