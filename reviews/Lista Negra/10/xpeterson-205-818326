How much did they spend on this series? Action packed and blew me away! Looking forward to the next one. I thought I could predict what came next but couldn't. It is Silence of the Lambs meets Dexter. Loved it.

There were some "yeah right as if that would happen" but for the most part it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Not much for music or vivid colors like CSI. But it really doesn't need it. Must of been filmed 2 years ago. No iPhones? Technology seems a bit behind times but it didn't take anything away. I thought I was watching a movie at first but then my husband said it was a new show. 

The DVR is set for the next one. Creepy ending tonight was a shock. If only it was a show about a couple wishing to adopt. Yeah right........
