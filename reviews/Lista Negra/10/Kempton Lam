What a great new show. One of the best series I've watched in a few years. James Spader played the character of Raymond "Red" Reddington, one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives, and Spader has captured my attention since the pilot and so far he has done a great job as I write this review after watching episode 4. I haven't watched anything by Megan Boone who plays Elizabeth Keen, FBI Special Agent, rookie profiler, before and I think Boone has done a wonderful job as well. Overall what impressed me the most has to be the great writing! I hate foolish and stupid plot turns and illogical actions by characters and I don't see many (if any) in The Blacklist. So far (up to episode 4) each episode bring some additional information to the characters that make me care more and more about them! I don't give out 10/10 often but this series is get a 10 from me. If it sucks later on, I will try to revise and lower my rating. It is so hard to find a good show to watch these days and I hope it stay good.
