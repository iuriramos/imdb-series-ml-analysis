The writers are absolutely Incredible as well as talented I Love This Show, they capture my attention immediately each and every episode. The character "Raymond" makes me laugh yet his demeanor is so cool. Lizzy is so pretty (in fact I think I'm going to take a picture to have her hair style duplicated on my head) and she is a very good actress In fact the entire cast is well portraying each individual's role.

I Absolutely Love This Show and watch it every week, I must Record this show so I can replay and pause so I don't miss any part and it times I catch an episode and watch it a second time :-) OK it's true I am so hooked! I record it not on 1 DVR but on both, I can not take a chance if one of the DVR's quits working I Love Raymond's character, he's too cool! The show The Blacklist is in my top two of each show that airs.
