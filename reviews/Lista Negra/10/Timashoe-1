So I started out with limited expectations. My husband and I are big crime drama enthusiasts, so of course we were gonna have to try out this mega-hyped show on NBC. But as I went into the season, I expected that it would be fairly run-of-the-mill dime a dozen.

So glad to be wrong. I love this show, and it's getting better. The first episode was good. The next, really good. The Stewmaker tonight was completely awesome! Goodness, I'm not someone that picks apart characters and story lines and plot structure... well, I am, but I don't generally report about it on a review board. To me, if the story is entertaining and the characters halfway believable, it's good. It may even be great.

James Spader, of course, steals the show for me. LOVE the character he's developed and is continuing to develop. Boone as Keen and Klattenhoff as Ressler are really entertaining as well. The ushy-gusher in me is keeping fingers crossed for a possible romantic twist later down the road. Although I'm a fan of Keen's husband too . . . just not as much. :) Anyway, if you like crime dramas, you'll love this one. Out of all the ones out there to choose from, this is a good one to get into,at least in this lady's opinion. :)
