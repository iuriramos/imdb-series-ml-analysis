In my opinion, The Blacklist is one of the best, if not THE best TV show I've watched, and as a Film and TV Student, I watch a lot of TV Shows.

Raymond 'Red' Reddington is high on the FBI's Most Wanted List, and the FBI are quite shocked when for no apparent reason, he hands himself in. However, the catch is that he will only speak to one FBI Agent, Elizabeth Keen. The show continues through the series following the Cases that both Red and Keen work on together, and with a new case every episode, but also a running storyline throughout the series, its amazingly exciting.

I believe that anyone who watches Crime Drama, or Action Drama, or just general Action orientated shows would adore this. James Spader, who plays Reddington, is absolutely brilliant and has rekindled my love for him after watching him in Boston Legal and Secretary. Megan Boone, who plays Liz Keen, who is quite an unknown actress, is very expressive and adds another element to every scene she is in. The chemistry between Boone and Spader is on another level, which really adds to the characters and to the show.

Trust me, just give this show a go. I was sceptical at first, but I was hooked by the first episode. In my opinion, the show is so underrated and should get more publicity and more hype as its just so well put together.

You'll be hooked in no time.
