One day my world history teacher comes in dressed like Reddington, and I instantly wanted to check out this show. I watch it and I've never been the same... I believe my rating of 10/10 is an understatement. IT'S TOO GOOD. Raymond Reddington (James Spader) is such a badass, and after a few more episodes, Liz (Megan Boone) also turns into a badass, especially during the Luther Braxton series. The team is pretty cool and the way they track down the criminals are ingenious. I've never said "AWESOME" so many times in a single episode, or have been at the edge of my seat with a clenched stomach. You need to check this out. I'm not kidding. Drop everything right now, and tune to The Blacklist on Netflix or Hulu. You will be shocked at its greatness.
