I disagree with the fellow fan who finds the leading actress to be a let down, but I will agree that James Spader steals the show. The show is captivating. All the characters are great, villains and heroes alike (and they are all in grey areas!). I particularly will praise the show for its focus; I find too many shows out there are about a theme (crime, legal, drama), there is nothing wrong with that, but it bugs me when they clearly run out of ideas and end up making it personal about the characters. Not the Blacklist, the show is about the characters and the theme is almost accessory to the key characters' stories. I am not qualified to judge anyone's acting; but I can praise the writers and actors for bringing to life such fascinating bunch of persona who come together and blend well and this show is not short of surprises and thrilling enigmas. Out of all the detective, crime stories I read and watched, there isn't one episode that's deja vu, every episode is as original as the next. Keep up the great story line.
