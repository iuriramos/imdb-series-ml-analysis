Well-seasoned James Spader has never been better, and new (at least to me), Megan Boone is a very pretty but very competent newcomer. As western authors have often described of their characters within the past, she has 'sand' - and discounting her seasoning as an actress, she presents as a credible 'newbie', wary of those around her and their motives. Think a moment: how would YOU act as a newbie within a MAJOR US Federal and international crime-solving organization? ...may get a few personal jitters? oh yeah; trepidation on your first few outings with your partner in the field? undoubtedly; feel hesitant or sometimes unsure or in doubt of yourself within that unit? undeniably. I think she displays that very well. Yes, the woman has 'sand.' The writing and story-lines are well-conceived and framed, the acting and delivery lines are very credible, and the editing is far above par. One of the most believable series I've seen in a very long time. There are enough 'surprises' on-board to keep you interested. I'm watching the 22 available episodes on Netflix live streaming. My hope is, more will become available. If you enjoy domestic & international crime series with nefarious criminals and federal agencies as much as I do - and an excellent cast - this is one you'll really like. ~Bob Shank, Tucson AZ
