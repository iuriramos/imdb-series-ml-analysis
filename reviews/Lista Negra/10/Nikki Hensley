I have to say since I began watching The Blacklist it has become one of my favorite shows of all time!! James Spader (Reddington) is great in this show. Reddington is formerly the FBI'S most wanted & then ends up on the right side of the law in this action thriller. Later joined by Agent Keene of the FBI, Reddington & Keene make a great show. It is a must see. Great cast, exciting & overall awesome!! 

If you haven't watched it yet catch on demand or Netflix. You will not be disappointed unless you are not a fan of action & thrillers. GREAT SHOW!!!! Cannot wait for the return!!!! 

Blacklist!
