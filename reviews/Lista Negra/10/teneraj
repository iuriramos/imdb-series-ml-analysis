We have been watching this show since the pilot. I love how it keeps you guessing and all the twists and turns it takes. I hope this is in for many many many years. We need good TV shows like this and hostages all the NCIS' S criminal minds SOA Chicago Fire Rookie Blue Mistresses Scandal and the list goes on. News way less reality TV shows and more shows like the ones I stated above. I know I didn't mention all of the shows but you get the idea of what I'm saying. I would highly recommend this show all the these shows stated above and they are all really good shows. I love the way they suck you in and the cliff hangers make you say what it can't be over yet. Oh and the new Dallas absolutely love that show as well. It's another one that sucks you as well.
