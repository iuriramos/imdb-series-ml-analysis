Like any series the blacklist started off really strong. It was fresh, it had it's own sense of humor and the intelligence of the character Red was keeping everyone excited. Unfortunately, the effects have run out. I believe Blacklist has ended up as one poor quality series. Most of the characters are stupid, and that is made so Red can seem as intelligent. The acting of both Liz and Tom has been poor the last 3 seasons and the whole story line, the mystery of Liz's past, has been extended for to long. Just end it already.

Overall quality decreasing. I wouldn't recommend the series because I believe anyone would struggle watching the last seasons.
