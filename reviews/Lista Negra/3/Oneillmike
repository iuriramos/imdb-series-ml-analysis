Really disappointing. I like James Spader and the initial premise was interesting but the execution is just awful. The same formula is repeated in most episodes. Spader tells them who to get. The FBI screw up. Spader tells them what to do next. FBI screw up again and finally after Spader again tells them what to do they finally catch the bad guy.

I think the most comical character is the boss who walks in, gets briefed, barks out a few orders like "let's get this done" or "let's get this guy" and walks out again.

I am up to episode 13, series 1. The chick and her limping colleague can't even manage a simple arrest. How many bungled stakeouts or failed arrests before they realise these 2 agents should be making the coffee not running around the streets with guns.
