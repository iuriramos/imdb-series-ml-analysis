Let me summarize as much as I could tolerate.

A first-day-on-the-job FBI agent unknowingly facilitates the kidnapping of a 4-star general's daughter by taking the advice of a ten-most-wanted criminal master-mind. After the agent successfully identifies the general's daughter for the terrorists and then blindly chauffeurs her into an ambush (in-which not one of a half-dozen agents is able to radio for help); she gives the child over to the kidnappers, who decide to leave the hapless agent alive after offing anyone else they see. 

So the kidnappers are free to escape in oh-so-slow rubber rafts in broad daylight across an empty harbor. Oh my, these guys are just too clever! 

And they do look like a terrorist consortium of Einsteins compared to the idiots running this fictional FBI. The newly "hired" agent is now completely in charge of the case, with full-access to the master-mind. Ignoring her usage in the situation, the fact she's still alive, and of course the informants familiarity with her would mostly likely land her in solitary-confinement pending further investigation.

In the end I would guess they finally discover the master-mind is using the terrorists and all of them together, but they were all too dumb to realize it: and oh, the master-mind is actually her father or something...

But after so many plot non sequiturs: who can even care?
