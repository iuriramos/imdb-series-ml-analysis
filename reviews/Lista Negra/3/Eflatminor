The good:

- James Spader, who inhabits and exudes his character flawlessly

- Some compelling performances by the villains

The bad:

- Choppy and uneven editing, making the show feel at times awkward, artificial and cheap, like high schoolers cut it together

- Boring and forgettable dialogue

- Subpar acting from the regular supporting cast: everyone acts like they're acting, nobody is believable or engaging, maybe with the exception of the husband, Tom

- Poor characterisations of the regulars (again with exception of Tom), who have little to no personality, no backstory or points of interest; they feel like cardboard cut-outs, not real people, and if any were absent from the show or if their lines were said by a different person, it would not make the faintest difference

- Contrived ineptitude of the Agency, and uninteresting simplistic relationship between Spader and said Agency - so much potential to develop a nuanced and complex tug-of- war here, but no, it's just the Agency running around sheepishly doing Spader's bidding week after week

The god-awful:

In spite of the myriad problems above, it is Megan Boone who single-handedly renders this show unwatchable for me. She does not act. She says lines. Monotonous, slow, slurred lines, like she's bored. When her face does something other than her habitual expression of wooden indifference with mouth slightly ajar, brow slightly furrowed, it is a remarkable event - one cannot help but point and exclaim, "look! she's acting! I see some acting!" That's what happened at our house, where two people pointed and shouted at the same time. It was a thrilling moment. Regrettably, it (her acting) lasted about a second and never happened again.

We are a household of James Spader fans and embarked on watching this show with enthusiastic fervour. 7-8 episodes later, while my householders are still clinging to the show for Spader's sake, I have broken from the pack and decided that even Spader cannot rescue this show and make it worth the agony. I cannot sit through 20 scenes of abysmal acting, cheesy dialogue, and Megan Boone just for one scene of James Spader. If I want to see Spader, I have better options.

Such a shame, that this show, with such a promising premise and the delectable, talented Spader as the leading man, has turned out to be so frustratingly lacklustre. The biggest problem is the failure to cast a female lead who can match Spader in verve and energy, and actually deserve his attention. Because wooden Boone can't act her way out of a wooden spoon, the dynamic between her and Spader feels very fake and put-on, as he's dancing and parrying and winding webs of intrigue around her, and she's just standing there, looking bland, being bland.

I give this show a 3/10. Sorry, Spader. It's not your fault. I hope you will be able to move on soon to something more worth your time.
