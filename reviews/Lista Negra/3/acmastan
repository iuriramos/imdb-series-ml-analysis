I love, or loved, the show. I liked Spader A LOT,even when I found out he traveled with clinton and the child predator on his private plane. I believe his name is Epstein. Anyway, watched the show religiously (pun intended) until recently. It seems it has gone the way of many good shows by creating episodes with a message. This past week it was the FRINGE RELIGIOUS RIGHT!! Gasp. Next week I do believe we have a similar show. Guys, I realize there is an election coming up and the media feels the need to beat the worn out drum about the FRINGE RIGHT!! But, Good Lord, getting old. Say, how about doing one on Muslim extremist that want to blow up our malls? Or how about the drug riddled, gang riddled inner city types. Certainly there must be a big bad guy there. So, you probably won't care but I won't be watching any more. No, I meant to have clinton with a lower case. Thanks.
