I started watching this show because I am a fan of James Spader but Megan Boone has ruined this show for me.

She hardly acts in the series and is just a good face on the show. I have seen the first 20 episodes and cannot dare myself to look at her anymore.

Apart from James, only the character of Tom is notable. 

Rest everything looks too sloppy. FBI people who are lifting murder weapons with bare hands. Lot of such loop holes here and there. I was surprised by the cumulative rating of show. I thought it would be a good show considering the rating. I guess there are a lot James Spader fans out there ;).

There are so many things which makes this show bad in so many ways but most of all its Megan Boone.
