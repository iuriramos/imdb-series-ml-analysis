Spader/Reddington's character appears to be a pseudo Hannibal Lecter - psychotic genius that wants to teach Clarice/ Elizabeth, played by Boone. 

Spader carries the show, along with decent plots. 

Boone is HORRID! She has yet to learn to express even basic acting ability. 

Ex: she appears to be holding back a laugh, during dramatic scenes and times when she should be agitated/frustrated, she has deer in headlight eyes...as if there is no one home. 

Maybe she will become a better actress, using this show as a platform but I've seen all I can see and I'm at episode 8 of the first season.
