The show had a promising plot, but it was wasted by subplots full of tired clich√©s. 

Sometimes the course of events in subplots become insulting to the intelligence of viewers.

The only positive thing about the show is James Spader's performance as a mastermind criminal. The rest of acting is clumsy and sloppy, especially the main female protagonist.

It is not a quality show, but if you swallow your pride and lower your expectation to merely being entertained, then you may not dislike it.

Wish it was written by more professional writers.
