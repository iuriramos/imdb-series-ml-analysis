I was completely disappointed right after watching the first episode. I am not sure about Spader's acting skills anymore. I don't believe his character. 

The most wanted Criminal walking around the streets, hang out, lives in a hotel. God! This is so stupid! I can't believe public can give good reviews to something like that. 

Among such good shows like "Dexter", "Revenge" or "Hannibal" I guess there is always a room for some crappy TV series like "Following" or "Blacklist", in which trailer appeared to be better then TV show itself.
