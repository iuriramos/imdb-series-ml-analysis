I can't believe this show has 8.2 Points in average after watching 4 episodes... i tried to find out what people love about it but it's just so over the top and unbelievable that i'm suspecting that only the usual CSI:Miami crowd can like it.

According to this show, the FBI is a club full of incompetent tie wearers who cannot figure out anything.

Spader's acting, while great, cannot save the character he plays. It almost never makes sense what he's putting out.

Villain's are completely safe from the FBI and CIA as long as they flee the immediate crime scene.

The female FBI agent that is paired up with our main character is completely incompetent, gullible and on top puts up a lackluster acting performance. It's really really cringe worthy.

I didn't enjoy this show at all and will quit for now.
