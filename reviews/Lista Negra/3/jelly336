I used to love The Blacklist. But the last season has tanked.

How many times Can Elizabeth and the baby be kidnapped? And James Spader is now a wasted asset. His character is now a one-one-dimensional cartoon.

And the whole killing Mr. Kaplan is just weird and completely off the wall. It has some so predicable. Who did't see that Aram's new girlfriend was't a plant. It seems that everyone is now a plant.

I think I'm done unless things turnaround real quick. They need to can the over extended personal story lines and get back to what the show did best. Take names and kick butt..
