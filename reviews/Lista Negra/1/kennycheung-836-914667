Next 10 episodes, this is what's going to happen. Some supposedly "most dangerous criminal alive kills one or more person. Then, James Spader comes out and said " I know the man you are looking for, if you want my help blah blah blah." *beep* comes close to happening, but don't. Bad guy gets shot at the end. Stupidest show ever made. You see first episode, you've seen them all. The overall story line is slow and uninteresting. There is no attachment to the characters. They make the FEDS look so stupid. They give each criminal a nickname but no one really cares about it. I can't believe this show gets good reviews, it's literally the same story every week.
