The opening episode held possibilities. From that point on, this series fell off a cliff. 

If you like weak scripts, soap opera plots, poor direction, implausible plot solutions and resolutions, huge plot holes, absurd twists, boring car chases, explosions, plane crashes, gunfights, brutal beatings, blood, gore, torture ...you'll love it. 

While James Spader is merely passable in a lead role, Megan Boone is a disaster as co-lead. Her attempt at acting is an irritating, dismal failure characterized by a perpetual, pained look on her face while delivering lines with all of the emotional impact of a telephone operator, and I'm being kind.
