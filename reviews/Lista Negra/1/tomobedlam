At points i didn't know if i was watching a clich√©'d parody of a 90's FBI series or something that actually was supposed to be taken seriously. From the score to the direction to the stereotypical and hackneyed Hannibal/Starling main character relationship, this programme goes out of it's way to be unoriginal. don't waste your life. Absolute tripe.I'm supposed to write 10 lines for a successful review. How can i drag this out? Spader is OK, but i just like spader. Everything else is just so boring and two dimensional. In a time where Breaking bad, the Wire, Deadwood, Mad men are ruling the roost programmes like this need to up their game.
