This show started out fairly fun.

Like others have said, the acting is so bad that if they hadn't placed Spader in the part as Red it would have probably been a total flop. Spader began to feel his character as time went by.

The main female (heroine?) is weak, always emotional, and a horrible "agent." So many simple minded decisions, and always rescued by another due to her own stupidity. Her emotions get the better of her, and the enemy always uses this and gets an upper hand (e.g. scene baby making factory of women in beds).

The last two episodes of the first season were so poorly done, so full of holes, as if it were a work in progress.

So, what do they do when they've got nothing left to give? Throw in real political Conservatives or Republicans and juxtapose them against evil. So out of place, so transparently stupid (like all of the left). Says the child "Hey, let's place Ted Cruz and Allen West next to the villain!" "That will increase the ratings!" Except, it won't. Leftist propaganda ruins so many shows. This was the last straw to an already weak and broken show. Perhaps they know this, and this was their last hurrah on the way out the door. Pathetic. Why not show the real villains, like Rezko and Bill Ayers?
