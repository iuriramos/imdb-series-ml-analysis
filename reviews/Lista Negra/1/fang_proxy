i don't write reviews..but after watching blacklist, i was thinking to myself what is this crap?what are they doing?so i have to warn others or they will kill someone after watching blacklist the old formula..take a pretty face and so the audience feel attracted to her?she is such a terrible actress, she can't express feelings nor reactions and the mastermind on the other hand....somehow he is helping fbi to arrest everyone of them but nobody knows in the criminal world that he is the mole?like they are all stupid except him his acting is also cheesy and superficial, every case is solved easily with some out of the blue twist with no realism.....

i know this is not dexter nor breaking bad...but it's cheesy, predictable, fast paced with no realistic approach or logic....all you will see is a pretty face with a heavy makeup?

if you have a functional brain you will hate this show! 

sorry for my bad English...
