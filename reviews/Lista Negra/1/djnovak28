So the female protagonist is an emotional, ineffective,unprofessional FBI agent. Freaks out when meeting her first bad guy after training at "Quantico". Freaks out when meeting her second bad guy, who did bad things right in front of her. The husband appears to have no personality other than to stand in her shadow, and he is apparently incapable of taking care of himself. After her husband's injury, she wears underwear to scrub her husband's blood off the carpet, weeping, rather than hiring a cleaning crew. The protagonist is also too young to be believable, but What a bore. The "Silence of the Lambs" premise is trite. Am very disappointed, I enjoy Spader's work in general.
