I started to watch this show for James Spader. It turns out, he's the only actor worth watching in this show. Harry Lennix is the only actor that can even come close to supporting Spader. But Lennix isn't shown enough to do that. I think the storyline is a great one. But it needs more actors like Spader to sell the roles played. If it had better actors and they fix the ignorant little details they think "the viewers won't see". It would be worth watching. My time will be spent on other shows. It is too bad to see Spader not properly shown the way he should be. I have been a fan of Spader since "Less than Zero". He needs to smile more. His smile shows his power and strength. I watched the first three shows in hopes it would get better, it didn't.
