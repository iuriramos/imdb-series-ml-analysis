My first review

Watching the trailers and knowing James Spader would be in the lead I expected quality entertainment. 

After watching the first two episodes I was really disappointed. Spader is great like always, the rest of the cast mediocre maybe below. I never heard of Megan Boon but she can't act... It's like watching a soap actress.

Too bad it's not as enjoyable as I hoped it to be. I'm surprised that this series got such high ratings. Really? 

For better series like this check "The Killing" (Danish Version)
