I have no idea why these writers and directors think that they can just throw plots and stuff out there. This has been the worst show I have seen so far this year. #1 the FBI and the CIA don't work together... one is external one is internal. #2 criminals don't get to choose who they speak to and they most certainly don't get to go out somewhere for dinner at a place that the police/FBI have not checked out yet... so silly. It's lame to think that they think we are that stupid. I really don't think anyone could possibly like this show. Can't imagine that the general public likes this crap. Please run screaming from the room. My thoughts and mine only maybe?
