This entire show is cringe worthy. it actually makes me sick to watch. I am bewildered as to how it has not been canceled or received positive reviews. 

****This May contain Spoilers******

Lets start with the whole concept. The idea that the FBI is so incompetent and easily manipulated is just ridiculous. And that one man seems to know every single bad person on the planet is laughable. The show breaks down so each episode is stand alone and has it's own clichéd bad guy of the week. The "driving force" through the series is how Red knows Elizabeth and what his relationship is with her. Which the writers beat to death through each episode. 

Next is the acting. I don't really care who Spader is he sucks. His character is so clichéd I expect him to wear a cape and dance in the shadows and have a Machiavellian laugh. The entirety of his character consists of knowing every person on earth, having some stupid story of how he met them, telling more stupid, long and tedious stories every chance he gets and having a pervy infatuate with Elizabeth Keen. There is no character development and no relate-ability. 

As for Elizabeth Keen (played by Megan Boone) she is boring and flat. Her character is predictable and shallow and Megans acting is transparent. Her entire character arch is being the "tough girl" and telling Red she hates him and then being forced to work with him again. Why anyone thought she could lead a show shows the incompetency of the filmmakers behind this atrocity. 

The rest of the cast is just as miserable in their roles. Harry Lenox is grating as "the big boss" and all the other stereotypical archetypes are present and badly represented. We have the "tough guy" Donald Ressler, the "the nerd" Aram Mojtabai and the "straight cop" Samar Navabi. 

It's really sad that poorly designed and executed shows like this exist when other actual great works are ignored. How anyone could enjoy this show or give it praise is beyond me.
