for a series this good at least put some effort on the graphics, their are lame and they ruin the series. get someone with more experience to make them, they are not that hard, animation is easy but long, thats all. the explosions or even the private jet, the same private jet only that different background looks awful, when the bomb exploded on Red's home, COME ON, LAME, and then the parts of plain falling, really bad.

Do something about it for the next season.

that why I give it a 1 for graphics and animation, for the plot and everything else it deserves a 10 I can't stop watching it, its amazing.

ADVICE.

pay someone to do a better god on the graphics and animation.
