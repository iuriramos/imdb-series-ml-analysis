Casting, screenplay, directory and acting. Everything could be worst as it is. I've never seen any time-wasting job like this before.

Screenplay writers are extremely amateur and there are lots of holes and errors.

Director is not a director i guess. May be just a Picture Director. He has many bulky TV series jobs before and my guess most of them are copies of the rest.

Actors are the worst players i've ever seen too. I do not understand why cause i don't think they can be so bad. I guess it's about the director and screenplay.
