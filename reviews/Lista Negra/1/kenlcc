As the title suggests, there are endless loopholes that makes up the first episode, which is a very big let down and will effect my view of the entire series.

of course there is the Reddington guy who the creators of the series wants to look "intelligent". Nope he isn't, because all other people in the pilot (including the main characters) are idiots to begin with.

and also, there is the predictability of the plot. u can guess exactly what happens next, and if u can't, there is nothing that can surprise you. No surprise = bad plot.

Then there is the acting, which is mediocre at best.

Just don't waste your time on this pathetic, predictable, wannabe intelligent series
