Another violent excuse to give modern audiences what really turns them on: graphic torture and agony inflicted on people. Sick. No acting. Just anger, hate and agony. Why has modern television turned to this theme in practically every show it cranks out? Why is everybody enjoying this? Why is everyone who makes this stuff so lurid? Can't we ever see anything uplifting, hopeful, clean and good anymore? One episode was all it took for me to decide to pass on it for good. It's another in a never-ending line of "24" crap. I hardly even watch TV at night at all anymore because of how depressed these shows make me. It's a terrible show. Fit for entertainment only for sickos. Like most Americans.
