With the exception of James Spader, the cast of this show seem incredibly stupid but somehow are supposed to have the experience and expertise of aged veterans in the field. I don't believe that FBI agents are in their early 20s or even 30's. It takes years of work to get to that point. This fabrication I suppose is done to bring in a younger viewing audience. We aren't given any reason to even believe they possess intelligence.

There is a reason why James Spader is good on this show - age appropriate casting. This major flaw regarding the supporting cast keeps the show from becoming believable.
