This show is totally awful. When after a few episodes, you don't care if any of the main characters dies, you know you're in for a bad time.

Every single episode is filled with totally unrealistic and predictable plot twists. Even worse, they all have insanely huge plot holes. You can spot at least 4 or 5 of them in EACH episode.

The line of each episode is also exactly the same, which makes them unsurprising and totally boring:

-Some bad guy shows up. Usually a week after another guy blew up something and got caught by a very untalented FBI agent (who's a profiler, but shouldn't she be in an office and not ALWAYS on the front line with no bulletproof protection?). -Red obviously knows about him. -Lizzy doesn't want his help. -He offers his help to the FBI -The Fbi refuses -He leaves. -FBi: WAIT, OK, we'll give you whatever you want -Lizzy: OK, please help me. -They track the bad guy and find him super easily, Red backstabs one of his old friends to get the info. -They catch him RIGHT before he commits another bad deed. -Lizzy hates Red

and some super secret plot about her husband unravelling but honestly you don't really give a damn.

And that's it.
