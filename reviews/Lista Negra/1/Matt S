I'm struggling to even make it past the first 30 minutes of the Pilot given how bad this show is. 

As of writing this there are about 480 users who have reviewed this with an aggregate rating of 7.7. I can only guess that these reviews are not genuine given how terrible this show is. Hopefully once real people start entering a vote this show will have a more realistic rating.

If you are a fan of shows such as 24 or The Americans, you'll find that this show is offensively stereotype filled. The acting, directing, and dialog are terrible.

For anyone wanting to see a well written drama this show is more like a cartoon, which within a few minutes will manage to offend all sense of realism.

If you are curious about seeing a show with James Spader watch the pilot, then please leave a real and honest review so other people may know how bad this show is...
