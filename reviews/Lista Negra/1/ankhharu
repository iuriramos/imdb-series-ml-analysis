One of the absolute worst TV shows I've seen. Having run out of shows on HBO, Showtime, FX, Netflix, etc to watch, I decided I'd look at a list of TV shows on primetime that were not comedies (Love TBBT, HIMYM, and a couple of others), and was looking for a good drama or something more than 22 minutes long. Oh wow. This is what passes as good on primetime networks now? Bad. Cheesy. Terrible dialogue. More holes in the plot than in a screen door. One has to think that anyone rating this above 6 has never seen a good show like Game of Thrones, Orange is the New Black, True Detectives, Justified, The Sopranos, and countless other shows that make this show look ridiculously amateurish. I lasted 2 episodes and boy was that tough. I feel bad for James Spader, I guess he needed the pay. To think, shows like Freaks and Geeks and Firefly were cancelled after one season. Yet this garbage was given a 2nd season. Proof that Networks have no idea what they are doing.
