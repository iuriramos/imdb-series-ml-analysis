Clumsy, unoriginal writing (with potholes galore!), inanely absurd situations, stupid characters, unnecessary graphic violence...the list goes on. Terrible show, with a decent performance from the always-reliable Spader, but it ain't enough in this case.

In the pilot, we have poorly constructed caricatures of people (most of them really dumb), an over-the-top and ridiculous plot which includes children in danger (a little girl is abducted by a terrorist, who straps a bomb to her), brutal violence, non-comprehensible 'plot' points, and a 'surprise' realization at the end thrown in for what they thought was good measure. Not buyin' in, won't be watching this claptrap. Sorry, James.
