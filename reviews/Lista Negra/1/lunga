The premise of the show is so far fetched and the number of follies that have to occur every episode to keep this show going, are just too much. James Spader is Phenomenal, make no mistake about it, but the rest of it is just simply awful.

Like "Lost" and a lot of shows since, there is a running storyline which gets visited for about 4 minutes each episode and is fairly interesting, but in the end there was no great surprise or payoff. After the 4th episode, I just started fast forwarding through the episode storyline to get to the recurring part. I watched the entire first season, and decided to give the second season a try but could not get through the first episode without swearing at the TV. Please, if you value plot, continuity and logic, please avoid this show, or at least catch a few episodes to see Spader.
