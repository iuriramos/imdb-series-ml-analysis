This was absolutely dire.

Downloaded it on the back of the high rating on IMDb - HOW did this get a that rating? It's terrible, I couldn't even finish the first episode

acting - terrible plot - ripped off from various better series and movies, done badly this time and thrown together 

When the main character, on her first day, after surviving being crushed by a truck and then having her husband nearly murdered, goes on to stab a guy in the neck while in FBI custody (and on camera), then the other guy the FBI has randomly escapes out an open window?? Wtf, give me a break, it's ridiculous.

Terrible, don't waste your time, seriously BAD viewing.
