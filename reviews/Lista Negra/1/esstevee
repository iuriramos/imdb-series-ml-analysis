So predictable, is embarrassing, I was going to say it's a rehash of so many plot lines but it isn't, is just the same plot of so many, in a different location.

As for the "mystery" of Husband, Father etc not again. Sadly unoriginal , that may be saved by the charismatic Spader, but I am sorry to see such a great actor reduced to appearing in this rubbish.

If it makes it to a 2nd series I'll be stunned, in fact I don't think well get to the end of this series. Still if The Following can do it,who knows, it just shows in a world full of x factor etc what crap passes for entertainment.
