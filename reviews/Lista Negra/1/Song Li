Come on, if this show wants to pour dirty water on China, please do it professionally. It is true that China has one child policy. However, when you have a second child, you will only be fined and the government won't take away or force you to abandon your child. It is also very amusing to see how America has portrayed other countries as devils while American government is actually invading every mobile phone and laptop. This show used to be a big hit in China. Now the Chinese fans' feelings have been hurt and if you go to Chinese twitter you could see a lot of Chinese fans are boycotting this show. Good work, play writer, way to go! By the way, next time please find someone who can really speak mandarin.
