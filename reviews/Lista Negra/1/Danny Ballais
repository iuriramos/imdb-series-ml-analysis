They sure do a lot of stupid, senseless things in this show. Here are a couple of things that I wish I could ask the makers of the show:

1. Why is Elizabeth Keen such an incompetent, stupid character? (she makes a lot of moronic decisions, and she gets beat up for the most stupid reasons)

2. Why are the supposed elite units guarding their headquarters incapable of defending their compound? (They remind me of Red Shirts and Storm Troopers)

3. Why are they incapable of protecting/securing/disposing of supposedly Top Secret information? (approved paper shredders; NO CELLPHONES in secure areas; no sharing of access to computers-- especially with a criminal genius like Red; etc.)

There is a very, very long list of foolish, laughable and downright stupid things they have on this show!
