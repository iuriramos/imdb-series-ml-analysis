I watched the pilot episode. The acting is so bad. I was actually laughing through the entire show. Everything felt cheaply done. There was nothing in this show that seemed remotely plausible. It was like trying to watch a show that combined Silence of the Lambs and Homeland, except they dragged a bunch of people of the street, who had never worked in t.v. or cinema, and said make this show. The script, I think my son's pre-K may have written it. I'm actually quite astonished at some of favorable reviews this show has received. Even Spader, who is normally great, can't save this wreck. Save yourself the trouble, watch Homeland instead. Watch it again if need be. Don't waste your time with this show.
