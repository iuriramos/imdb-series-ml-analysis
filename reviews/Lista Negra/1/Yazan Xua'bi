I'm not sure why i watched it, i guess i thought i was giving new things a chance? Started off so well and found Reddington to be a great character BUT the acting in general, especially by Agent Keen, is terrible.The concept is great but week in week out take down of super villains is pretty unbelievable - feels like it was trying to be Dexter but without the clever sub plots and story lines. Essentially college level writing. and come on the pilot episode is like Salt "Angelina Jolie" movie By the end of season 1, which I had to force myself to watch, it felt rushed and was too predictable, BUT I am a big fan of Mr Spader so i can't wait to see another good TV show for him
