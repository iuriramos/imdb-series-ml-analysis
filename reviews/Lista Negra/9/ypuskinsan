After AMC, SHOWTIME and NETFLIX, NBC is another network which telecast great quality show. And it also is the network having the most loyal viewers and it will remain so if it continues to delivers quality shows like L & O, Hannibal etc.

Theme of this show is already seen in various other TV like white collar, various other show where a main protagonist is an informant to cops or fbi, but the blacklist comes with a different strategy to how the crooked character is manipulating the developing plot as well as other important characters. The way story unfolds it gives an impression as if RED is secretly grooming Elizabeth Keen for a higher purpose other than to enhance her carrier.

With brilliant casts and a great script this mystery, thriller, action show gives a balanced quality TV to engage a wide variety of demographic viewers. A must watch for every TV junkie and a glowing recommendation to those who occasionally watch a few selected tvs.
