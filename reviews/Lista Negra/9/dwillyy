This show has started off pretty amazing, the first episode was pretty bland but still set up for a great season.

The second episode and so-forth are amazing with the plot becoming more and more unpredictable. The connection 'Red' has with the woman agent is still a mystery and how he knows so much about her.

Just when you think its over then another twist occurs (especially with the second episode).

The acting is fairly good but Jason Spader just steals the show with his perfect character.

The idea of the show is quite a bit like Homeland but hopefully it branches off into its own show so the critics can stop comparing the two shows.

Overall, great start to the season an hopefully the twists continue and sets up a great finale
