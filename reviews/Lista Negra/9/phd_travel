This show is great because it's got the right balance of likable characters, good acting, a bit of unresolved mystery - who is her father and what's up with the hubby. So it keeps you tuning in to see what the connection is between the two leads, the young FBI agent and the mastermind criminal. It's a crime show that is not too gruesome or sickening and so far isn't repetitive. Each episode you don't know how things are going to turn out and the pace is good.

James Spader's best acting quality is his masterful delivery of dialog which makes you watch every word he says carefully. But physically what happened to him? Wish he could shed some weight and grow his hair longer.

Megan Boone is convincing because she isn't an impossibly beautiful actress being a bit full in the face. She is pleasant looking enough to watch week after week and looks like she could be in law enforcement and have a school teacher husband.

Worth watching.
