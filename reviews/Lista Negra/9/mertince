I am an ordinary guy doing an ordinary job and one of my escapades from an ordinary life is following good series. After watching the pilot of "The Blacklist" I was hooked up... Man, putting the screenplay and the story aside acting is top notch in this TV series.

James SPADER had an influence over his audience as a somewhat "erotic actor" considering his titles like "Secretary", "Crash", "White Palace". I think he found the role of his life! This Red character fits on him like a tailored suit. Let's not forget Megan Boone. She is good at playing this strong but vulnerable fresh FBI agent. Each episode is well written and the background story is progressing rather efficiently. I am a computer specialist and because of that I find the "tech stuff" a bit weaker than it should be.

I gave a 9 as it is a "should be seen" TV Series. I hope it is never canceled.
