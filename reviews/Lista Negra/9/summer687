I really love the concept of this series (Redemption is always interesting to watch). I love how the director deliver the suspense, the tension throughout each episodes. Another reason to love the show is James Spader (I can't believe i never heard his name before). His performance is just wow! I like how he seemed to be indifferent but you can almost see hundreds of expressions through his eyes and little gestures.

That's for the good part. For the bad part, i think it's really lack in their action scenes (due to budget maybe?). The fighting and chasing is really dull and not interesting at all. Another thing that really annoyed me is that, other than Spader, all other cast is really average or even below par in their acting. Most of them didn't bring anything to the table. The main actress, Megan Boone, seemed to be unable to match Spader's performance. It's not that she can't act, it's just that it could've been better.
