James Spader is never going to disappoint. He's got that smarmy, overconfident character down to a tee. In fact, have I ever seen him play a regular, average Joe? He's that person here. I think I missed an episode or too where it was explained who he is and what he really does, but no matter, he seems to be always right on the money when he outs the dregs in the underworld- so why, Lizzie, why do you still keep doubting him? Lizzie is played with a surprising vulnerability by Megan Boone. Usually law enforcement females seem to be unflappable like Kate in Castle, Olivia in Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, or Teresa in The Mentalist. My only other favorite character is Aram. Reminds me of Charlie in Numb3rs. And the shadowy husband. How come I can't let go of his image as the devoted and loving husband? Exactly the kind of guy you need to weed out potentially bad dating prospects. Everyone else is okay, but needed to flesh out the show. It follows the format of "Fringe" where we're introduced to creep of the week without having them be a recurring character for the rest of the show.
