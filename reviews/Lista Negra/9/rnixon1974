Years ago, Mel Gibson made the film "Payback". The movie's tag line was "Get ready to root for the bad guy".

That sentiment is exactly what this show encourages. Raymond Reddington (played by James Spader) is the best villain to come out of Hollywood in years, in my opinion. Jon Bokenkamp has done an incredible job, up to this point.

Dark, slightly convoluted and rather twisted, this show can be described in many ways. I'll call it the anti-procedural. Spader is top notch in the role of Reddington, and he's obviously enjoying himself in the process. Megan Boone is very good as Agent Elizabeth Keen. The rest of the cast is strong, as well. The scripts, direction and production values are all very good to excellent.

Edit: Other reviewers have commented (sometimes vociferously) on Megan Boone's coiffure. Uh, folks... as we all know, many actresses in Hollywood have wigs/weaves/extensions/Rogaine/bad taste in hats. It happens. The continued employment in show business of folks like Carrot Top, Matthew Lillard, Sharon Osbourne, as well as the cast of every so-called reality show on TV, are all much more troubling than Megan Boone's hair.
