I like mysteries and crime series, but am also a sucker for sci fi. This isn't sci fi, but some episodes have a weird and wonderful twist that feeds off my thirst for fantasy.

This is therefore an ideal TV series for me to watch. A new crime or mystery to solve every week, plus a few big mysteries that last a season or more. James Spader is excellent as Red with a charming goodish evil character that makes you root for him in every episode despite him being a nasty.

Season 2 was entertaining and fun to watch, but became a bit dull and boring by the penultimate episode of the season. But,the last episode was amazing! A thrilling crazy ride that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Cannot wait for season 3!
