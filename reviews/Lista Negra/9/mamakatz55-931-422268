A GREAT Show! I cannot wait each week until the new show! I wasn't a fan until about the middle of the 3rd show....too many untied ends left that were a bit confusing. But the writers got in the swing of things and it is an an engaging storyline. Think that again it got a bit confusing with the alan alda character, the lady in charge, still haven't unraveled the why/who/what. This is a new show that you must watch! Waiting to see how Tom Keen figures into the whole plot....they keep bringing him up in nearly every show so they must have something good planned. I believe that the writers do an excellent job of eluding to things as well as proving things so as to have it all make sense in the end. James Spader and Megan Boone are excellent-Kudos to them both.
