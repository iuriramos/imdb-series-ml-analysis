I could write a massive review about how amazing the first few episodes have been Because they are, but I wont, there are others which I am sure will do it for me.

I will spend this review loving the fact that this show can go in so many directions, Each episode thus far has had enough drama action and suspense to last you until the next episode is out and with numerous action points the drama can go in numerous directions, like Whats gonna happen with her partner, what is gonna happen with her dad, IS Reddington her father.

With so many possibilities that could unfold i just cant wait until the next episode. James Spader YOU RULE
