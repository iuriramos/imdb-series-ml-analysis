I found an interesting series , the premise is very good .. some purists may not like not understanding about it , but I guarantee that they will be few , most certainly understand the purpose , the series is extremely realistic , people have to start appreciate things rather than just throw stones , I bet that many who say that the showing here, as violence among others, are with Game of Trones in their play-lists as a favorite, then they are not hypocrites , just enjoy the show , it off, and one last thing , you see not only this series that way, but all they can, we can do in our short time on earth is to enjoy good things , we need to prove anything to anyone , teaching the priest to do the service , most entering the level of this series are mature people or am I mistaken? then gets the hint.
