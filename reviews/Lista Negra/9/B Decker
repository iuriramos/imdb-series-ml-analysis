I am forced to concur somewhat with Eflatminor that Megan Boone's character is not my favourite. I don't really find it a problem with the acting as such, but the character Elizabeth Keen: immature, self-absorbed, and self-righteous. But the world we live in is full of people we don't (and do) like. I just accept her as much a villain as the rest of the Blacklist and move on LOL.

Fortunately this show is not "Megan Boone The Blacklist" it is "James Spader The Blacklist". I never thought I would see a better James Spader than in Boston Legal. I was way wrong. I cannot over-emphasize that the overall production and script and storytelling is superbly done. James Spader emerges as a truly bankable star in this series, entertaining to watch, witty and intelligent.

This series can sometimes seem as indifferent to what we really think about the characters as Raymond Reddington can be. This is a BIG PLUS in the mood and storytelling of the show in my opinion (see earlier comments about Keen). What I really admire is this strong focus on powerful morals in the overall storytelling, without the typical tangents when the music changes and we are force fed five minutes of subtle slapstick that is supposed to make us "care more" about the characters (NCIS clich√©).

Perhaps the characters are more "likeable" in other serials (if you can actually like a fictitious person at all) but the storytelling is right here with this one.
