I have been watching the show for all three seasons, it has been a really good action and drama packed show. From the very being when Ramrod walked into the FBI, He and Liz have been stopping criminals in return for his immunity for the crimes that he as committed. Plot twist after plot twist keeps the show infringing, like when Liz finds out her husband winds up not being who he really is. But In a recent episode, Elizabeth died in childbirth. Hopefully, Tom and his baby girl will be able to live a safe life. After all this time, The relationship between Raymond and Elizabeth is still unclear but is speculated to be her dad. Hopefully, it will be revealed soon!! Overall a very good show!!!
