add a photo to Jon Bokenkamp the creator he is truly a genius ..!

there is a free photo on the net .. I love this show because the creator is really a genius the plot is really good and made excellent I also think there are some players that are not so good

like Elizabeth for example, but on the other hand have Really good actors like Red,

I think it's getting better because at first it was slow and now it's much faster, and the plot develops properly, I hope it will continue to be good and not canceled after several seasons as lot of good series go ,At the moment it does not seem that this is going to be canceled because it has a lot of viewers so ..
