This is one of those series that just catches you like a magnet. It really does. James Spader does a great justice as the lead aided by Agent Keane in her bi-polar role of a smart yet naive profiler. The storyline is great, and whereas the crime-drama theme is becoming the norm a la Person of Interest, this offers a new twist, especially after probably the producers realized they needed to layer the characters of the support characters. The beauty with it is that the blacklist could be endless and as more and more criminal masterminds are unveiled, so the sub plots run deeper, making the audience just jump to the next episode.

All in all, I can't wait for season 2. Red Reddington has me on his list!
