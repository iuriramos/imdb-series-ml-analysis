Veteran actor James Spader plays Red Reddington a former federal agent turned criminal mastermind. As he surrenders without incident to the FBI after being on their top ten wanted list. 

He will help them with this list, hence the title, on the condition that he talks with four-year agent but new profiler Elizabeth Keen, played by Megan Boone, who shows a bit of promise.

As there could be something more to this. As Elizabeth wants to adopt a baby with her husband, who has a few secrets of his own. And not who he seems to be if you saw the ending of the pilot. 

First case is that they have to rescue a small girl as Liz does a great job with the child. But then as a car crash comes to a turnpike, the girl disappears and they have to spend the rest of the pilot trying to find her and catch the main baddie, who when Liz comes home to take a breather, finds her husband beat up by him.

Harry Lennix as the FBI Assistant Director Harold Cooper. And serves mentor is a strong moral character. Who thinks that Keen is up to the job. And has potential. 

But the weak link is Donald Ressler, another head agent played by Diego Klattenhoff. Who comes off as stiff and wooden as a DC Field Agent. Who has the potential to being Liz's love interest should her marriage go south. But so far, he is a complete stiff and less than one dimensional.

Ryan Eggold as Keen's loving yet mysterious husband Tom. We know more about him in an hour. Than we learn about Ressler or Coopoer for that matter.

So far, hopefully the show will be off to a great start and a huge hit for the struggling Peacock Network.
