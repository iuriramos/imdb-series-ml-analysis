I'm so excited to watch The Blacklist after waiting for a long time! So far I enjoy the show so much! I can't wait to c for the next episode! Hope it continues to show more interesting scenes! When watching, it makes me continue to know what happen next. I think it's a movie not TV series. How come so good! I love to see some shows like this. We can't guess what gonna happen next. Who's the most trusted characters! All the casts are doing great job. The plots , casts, and soundtrack are pretty good! I pretty impress with the whole casts acting skills. Just the beginning of the show but they show how good they are. The bond between the main and supporting role casts is strong. Besides, the interaction between two main characters is so natural. I love that too. But, sometimes I feel a little nervous because the film showed a lot so blood scenes. I know it helps the show more excited but it somehow makes me feel so violent. For example, when a criminal guys stabbed Elizabeth's husband. I hope NBC will be air 3ep/wk.because it's too short to watch a good series. I bet this TV series gonna popular if they keep doing like this.
