This show is great. Best show of the 2013-14 season...HANDS DOWN. 

James Spader carries his part to the fullest and the other actors are really good (not sure about Ressler but he is not BAD). The mystery gets you hooked (or it did me). Who is Red? What happened back when he disappeared? Is Liz his daughter? Why did Red kill Sam? Who was Sam to Red? What is up with Tom Keen? Who is the girl who had his file and goes to his party and winds up in the car with him? Did Tom kill the Russian man in the hotel? 

If you want a really good show, watch this one. It is one of the only ones that I set aside time each week to watch. It cannot be beat. James Spader is so amazingly sinister that you kind of cheer for him somehow. 

The you have unexpected things happen. When Luli was killed I thought "Whoa?!". When Diane was killed I thought "Ok, didn't see it coming but not that bad". I expect at some point Alan Alda's character will be killed but who knows. 

They need to give us some more of Dembe's background and a little bit more of Malik. I love Malik. 

Highly recommended...a very enjoyable hour of the week for me.
