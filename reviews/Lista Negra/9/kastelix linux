the comments section is proof enough of what makes this show super- awesome. So many theories. So many questions. Not enough answers. Nearly everybody has an other side to them on this show.

I also think it is interesting that not a lot of people are talking about the first scene of the show (in the Pilot). The guy hands him the briefcase and says, "Must be good to be back home, sir!" And Red replies, "Yeah, we'll see about that."

The way the scene was shot and staged tells me that it was not just inserted at the beginning offhand. There's more to that scene. Why does the person address him Sir? Though I don't have answers now.

I do love the extent to which Red will go to protect Lizzy. And I agree with others that Tom's calmness is eerily unsettling. There's certainly more to him as well.

This is, by far, the best new show on television.
