James spader gave as expected high class performance and this show's plot and casting is extremely good. Megan Boone is OK in her performance but all the other character like Donald, aram, and Harold cooper were good enough to take this show to new limits. The only problem is the timing of James spader role, as it is very short, his role is about 5-7 min in complete 42 min show. the side characters like Diane, luli, tom keen are also good but the overall show is quite good. its better if they plot something big other than daily cases. the chemistry between James spader and Megan Boone is quite impressive, then characters are enhancing with every new episodes. the overall flaw in this show is about the week structure shown by FBI, their very easy skills and easy approaches, its like they don't know anything without reddington;s information which is highly inappropriate. my overall rating for this show is 8/10
