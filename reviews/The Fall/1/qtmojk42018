Pretentious script with unrealistic bad acting. Whoever decided to make this show is delusional.

All of the performances are over the top and the storyline is so unrealistic it's absurd. Please stay as far as you can. The leading actress is just totally unrealistic and unattractive. There is no character development. It's so boring and uninspiring. This show is the perfect example of how to make the worst TV show. I hope this show will never appear on my TV screen ever again. You can choose a lot of good shows but not this crap. 

Very very bad!
