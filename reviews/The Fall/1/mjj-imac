I suppose I felt guilty giving it one star. Soooo I watched it again with my laptop switched off. Okay ... TBF until the last episode it just about fell into the word entertainment with huge reservations.

Like I made tea and coffee several times and missed nothing. TBH the running time could easily have been edited to half. It was unnecessarily long and drawn out with VERY little in the surprise and thrills department. 

The last episode was doing okay; until the end. A completely ridiculous finish in-so-far as the writer or the directer .. or even the producer; simply ran out of ideas on where to take it. I sighed, yawned and then realised ...IT WAS ON BBC2. Had it been any good it would have been on BBC1. 

So after suffering it one more time, would I watch the third series. NOPE, not a chance. I'm sure I'll have some paint to watch drying.
