We know the formula for a modern TV show is that a white male always has to be the bad guy and the strong man-hating female lead has it in for him. Littered along the wreck of a plot there has to be female to female kissing etc etc.

But I expected a plot that made some sense and a police force that actually efficiently rounds up the bad guy. I didn't expect a woman who was not only a Keystone cop but a sl*t on top of it to be the lead. 

None of the show is believable .Its very slow moving and bizarre .Its on the level of a bad pornographic movie with plastic characters thrown into the series like random darts given flight in a bar full of drunks.

At the end of the second season the turgid lead Anderson is holding the killer rather than seeing if the man she slept with the night before is hurt after both were shot.

A fitting end would have been the killer garroting the already lifeless Jillian Anderson and sparing her audience the misery of her acting . 

Above all, this show lacks any sense of propriety or decency .Its just plain creepy from start to finish.
