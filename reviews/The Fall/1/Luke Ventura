After sitting through the first four installments of The Fall, I couldn't help feeling that this effort suffers from one of the key things wrong with television today. Someone comes up with a premise for a 60 or 90 minute "Movie of the Week" and then the Network Program Directors decide to stretch it out to five or six hours (or, even worse, a weekly series). Another good example of this was New Zealand's Top of the Lake with Elisabeth Moss. This one had me begging for infomercials. The Fall could have just as easily taken place in The Wax Museum. All the energy, so far, has taken place in the swimming pool! I don't know if it was the Director or the Actors or a bad sound crew, but all the whispery, sibilant dialogue has been like fingernails on a blackboard. All in all, this could have been a mediocre episode of Silent Witness.
