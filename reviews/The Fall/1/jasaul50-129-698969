Do not waste your time on this series unless you want to spend hours imagining that Ms Andersons acting will ever get better. The writing is awful in the last of the episodes year two and I feel watching paint dry would be comparable. There is no spoiler here because the whole series ends as a spoiled mess. What I wonder is what producers for year two were thinking after this ended because I can imagine it was contempt for their own work. Imagine watching someone holding on to a cliff and then everything goes black. This will give you a small glimpse of the entire show. The story year one was actually interesting if you take out a few actors, specifically one mentioned earlier in this review.
