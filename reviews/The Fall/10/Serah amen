I've watched both seasons 1 and 2 and to sum up this was one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. Everything was just too perfect.The cast is well chosen.Jamie Dornan's portrayal of Paul Spector was superb.This actor is able to express all those mixed up feeling of anger,calmness,fake sympathy,and control simply with his facial expressions and body language.He didn't need to speak.That was just outstanding performance.Actually,I started watching THE FALL for Jamie Dornan,who was newly known by me due to his role in Fifty Shades Of Grey and that was one of the greatest decisions I've ever made about watching a TV show.Jamie Dornan is an excellent actor and has potential hidden skills and talent that were waiting to be exposed.Also, Gillian's performance was great and strong,but honestly,for me,It was Jamie who created that fascination and made me so attached and influenced by this series.Great job and good luck in season 3!!
