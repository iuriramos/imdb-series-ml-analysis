Such a great TV series. I was skeptical to begin with, but was slowly drawn into the dark, exciting story line which takes place in the equally gritty yet somehow magical city of Belfast. At first glance, we could be tricked into thinking this is just another slow moving thriller, but we are not bored for the slightest millisecond. Not quite on the edge of our seats, we are held in a comfortable limbo, suspended between horror at the brutal murders of the beautiful, dark-haired Belfast victims and our interest in the role of "Peter" or Paul Spector, played by Belfast born Jamie Dornan. Drawn in by the psychology surrounding his motives and personality, we find ourselves inside Paul's head, as he spots his victim, stalks them, then "lovingly" creates his own fantasy around them through his intimate journals. Gillian Anderson is perfection in the role of Stella, an officer brought over from England to head the Murder investigation in gloomy Northern Ireland. At first we see her as an outsider, a seductress, but slowly her more human aspects are revealed. Despite her obviously elevated intelligence and detective skills in comparison to the PSNI, she remains modest and creates important human relationships with her officers, gaining their respect and trust. With "The Fall" we see the portrayal of a strong female who, like everyone, has flaws and is not the archetypal super-heroine we have become accustomed to, which adds to the realness of her character. Even more interesting is the strange relationship and psychological power play which develops between Stella and Paul, which is captivating and adds even more dimension to this incredible series. Looking forward to the third season.
