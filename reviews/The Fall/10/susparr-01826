This is the best TV series I've seen in years, certainly better than any US series. I am trying to patiently wait for season 3 to come to the US. It's disappointing to have to wait well after Europe sees the third season. I can say that I am an avid Jamie Dornan fan and I'm reestablishing my impression of Gillian Anderson. I just have not seen Ms. Anderson for a long time. Allan Cubitt has also become one of my favorite persons. What a genius! Thank you Mr. Cubitt, for taking a chance on Jamie Dornan. He has proved his metal (sp) and his talent. The series is well acted, well written and well directed. I can't say enough in its praise. May season 3 please arrive across the pond to Netflix soon!
