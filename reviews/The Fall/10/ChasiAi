I totally missed series one of this excellent drama. Gillian Anderson holds this together like a conductor within an orchestra. I watched it out of sync, from episode 3 of season 2. This meant I watched from the police perspective. At this stage I even thought the villain was being picked on by the authorities.Then watched season 1 and the first two episodes of season 2. Now watching from the villains perspective and knowing his responsibility. Finally watching the last 1 episode in-situ. Looking back on this order of episodes it could not have worked out better as this maintained the suspense that season one would have revealed. Jamie Dornan will now require a much bigger price tag for his services after Fifty Shades of Grey. 10/10. I am surprised at how BBC2 got to be involved in such an excellent drama and intrigued as to where season 3 will go.
