Jamie Dornan and Gillian Anderson perform a wonderful tango to the end. The writing of this series never disappoints. The entire cast are excellent. The art direction, lighting and soundtrack are flawless. Then we get Krister Henriksson, the Swedish "Wallander", as a forensic psychiatrist. Mind-blowing. I was slightly disappointed in the back- staging of John Lynch in Season 3. I have admired his work for decades. 

For me, the detail of the psychology and application of it in the British justice system was impressive. Anderson was tremendously convincing as the imperfect sleuth whose personality is in conflict with itself as much as with her suspect's. Her performance is up there with Helen Mirren's in "Prime Suspect". She managed to be low-key and riveting. I hope Netflix considers more crime drama of this caliber.
