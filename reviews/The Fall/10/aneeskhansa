THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT TV SERIES THE FALL... it is mind blowing series.. one of the best TV shows i watched.. brilliant.. loved it so much... waiting for the third season......... at first i thought it would be just a waste of time and their would be no pleasure in watching it but later when i downloaded it...... ohh man it was something i needed to watch.... Jamie dornan played tremendous role in the series... his accent of speaking that language... and one of the most important thing he did... The Killings .. he was so careful... he loved it... the second season was too complex it wrapped up my mind.. he did not even care when he was arrested. he was so intelligent and care full... superintendent Stella was good too she worked very hard to catch him.. he played them very well... now i am waiting for the third season.. wish it come soon... loved it very much
