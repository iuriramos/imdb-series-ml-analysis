OK it was the first drama series that I ever watched and completed within two weeks. Man, this is just awesome and kept on shocking me in every episode. The acting of Jamie is just wow. And the last episode of season two has now left me waiting and waiting. When on the earth would I be able to watch what happened next! Gillian was also superb in her acting. The twists, the plot, the screenplay, location everything is just wonderful. In love with the moments Paul has with her daughter Olivia, in fact they made me cry even. Now after completely watching the series I am here left thinking that what next can I watch that can help me gain interest.
