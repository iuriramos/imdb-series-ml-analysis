I came to The Fall in search of great drama after a post Breaking Bad hiatus and some interest in the Wire. Little I did i know the Fall would exceed expectations and both of these American dramas. I sat down to watch 1 episode and ended up staying up half the night to watch half the first season.

The Fall is brilliantly shot. It's slow, careful and deliberate direction syncronise with the plot and leading protagonists. Gillian Anderson is mesmerising.

Very few thrillers leave you affected as your eyes leave the screen but the Fall achieves this. For those that struggle to be captivated I dare you to watch this and defy you to look away.
