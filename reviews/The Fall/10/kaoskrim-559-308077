I am writing on my boyfriend's account however I just wanted to say I have seen the first season. Some people are right in that it does take a slow start, but it is the slow start with the big build up that makes it you wanting to watch more and more. If you like things that make you go WTF? did that just happen? I really like how dark the killer character is, and how far he will go. It is by far one of the best crime-dramas I have seen. I don't watch a lot of British shows and this one is one of the best. I suggest you watch this show. I finished it in a few days or so. the only draw back is that it is only eleven shows to the season. for now, and it is an hour long however it leaves you wanting to find out if they will catch the killer. I can't wait until season 2 comes out.
