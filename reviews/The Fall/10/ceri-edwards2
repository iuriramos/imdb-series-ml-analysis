One more episode to go, odd time to write a review but I just cant wait to express how good this show is.

I love detective stories, and have grown to accept a certain number of stereotypes if the plotting is good, it seems to go with the territory.

Not here though. The writing is fantastic, the tough old duffer cops show emotion, the strong female lead is a strong woman with dimensions slowly emerging as the series evolves. Without unrealistically ignoring the sorts of prejudice extant in our society the writing avoids her being a typical 'ballbuster' and allows her to develop meaningful relationships and respect among her colleagues.

The anti hero is fantastically normal and so much more menacing for this, especially outside of the killing 'events'.

The plotting is pacey and involving, the series has become more gripping with each episode. Fingers crossed for the denouement. I have very high hopes.
