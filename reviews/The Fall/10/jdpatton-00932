I am an avid thriller watcher. This is absolutely one of the best shows I have ever seen. The acting is spot on. Watching the story play out absolutely keeps you on your toes. 

This is a "true" thriller. It is a story that shows us it can happen and it is a story that shows us it has happened. Not exactly, but there are people all over the world with the same ominous thoughts and intentions. We all like to think we are safe in our little bubbles. We like to think we know the people we surround ourselves with so we don't pay attention to the little things that we do and see everyday that can end up catastrophically changing the course of our lives. 

The entire cast is fierce. It seems as if every part was made for that particular actor. It was filmed so well. The the two main characters, in my opinion, perfect casting! I had only seen Gillian Anderson on the X-Files and I wasn't aware that she actually is British, so I was blown away on her transformation into a British Detective S.I. She is brilliant and beautiful. Jamie Dornan is absolutely amazing and I have to add..... extremely easy on the eyes. He plays his part so perfectly from beginning to end. NO ONE else could have done this part. It was made for him. 

This is truly the best Thriller on Netflix so far.
