Interesting and inviting use of wardrobe and color filter changes to match emotions of characters as they reveal bits of themselves throughout both series. Main characters dance without touching, the dance of mind and strength. G.A. portrays the vulnerability and power of a woman with confidence, heart, and focus. J.D. is excellent choice for character, refreshing and not type cast. Unlike so many American films, we have time to attach bits of ourselves to each character, drawing us in closer to the stories that surround the lives of those whose lives are dedicated to helping others and themselves. Hoping for a third series.
