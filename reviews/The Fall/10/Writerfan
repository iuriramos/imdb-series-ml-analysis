I feel bad for the viewers that didn't appreciate this series. I might be a little prejudiced but since seeing every episode of Xfiles & everything Gillian Anderson has done, I remain completely enthralled with her ability to portray a character with the depth she does. I was very impressed with Jamie Dorman as well. 

Look - this series isn't like what Americans are used to. It isn't bright & shiny, every character doesn't look like they came from Central Casting and THAT is why you should give it a chance. It's raw, and dark and if you let it - it will suck you in. It feels so much more REAL 

So it is very procedural and there's a lot of talking but it can take you places that pictures or actions might not. You might not like all details but that's closer to real. Let the power of your own mind and imagination and the brilliance of Gillian & Jamie transport you.

I compare this to the works of Stephen King - whose written words can scare me deeper and longer than any of his movies. His books are extremely detail oriented but that's what draws you in. You feel there. His characters don't just eat dinner. They have freshly caught catfish, with tender golden French fries with a tall glass of iced tea with a splash of lemon.

Give me details and procedures- and then the drama with have so much more.

The end left me breathless and watching Gillian Anderson will never disappoint me
