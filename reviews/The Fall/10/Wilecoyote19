I've never watched a series quite like this one. It is original and very well acted by Jamie Dornan. He is incredible in this series. I wasn't sure he could act after watching 50 Shades of Grey, but I have since changed my tune completely regarding his abilities. He played this role to perfection, in my opinion, of course. Gillian Anderson was very good as well. Her accent was a bit muddled in the first season, but she seemed to get it together better in season 2. I'm very much looking forward to seeing season 3. The story line is great and very suspenseful. I enjoyed watching things from the serial killers perspective while being hunted by the police. Jamie Dornan has created a thrilling darkness with his character and that's what made me want to continue watching. I'm not sure why they made three seasons with it. There's only 5 episodes in season 1 and 6 in season 2. This could have easily been wrapped up in two seasons and been more of a short series like Under the Dome. I am now a big fan of Jamie Dornan and I love his Irish accent. Very hot!
