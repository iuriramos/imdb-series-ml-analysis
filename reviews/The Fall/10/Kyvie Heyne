It's been a while I haven't being that much fascinated by a shown TV! All the actors are very good! The story is not common. The scenarios are very sought. The suspense is present and the events go fast! It's a pleasure to watch it! At home, I can tell, no one come disturb me when I watch it on the TV p, they know it's my moment and I love this moment with the Fall!! Thank you so much Allan Cubitt!! I adore Gillian, it's an example for me! And Jamie is very good in this kind of role!! Love it!!!! I can't wait to watch the next season!!!! Will he die? Is she that fascinated that she will fall in love with him? Will she keep this obsession which is born for him?
