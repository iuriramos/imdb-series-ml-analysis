This is a very well written and shot series, with the perfect amount of tension within each episode. Each and every episode is in equal quality, shifting emphasis from either the story line or to the character struggles. Gillian Anderson acted simply superb. She brought a certain depth to the character. Jamie Dornan also did a splendid job, reminding me of Tom Hardy, not only physically, but also in his acting style.

If I would need to compare The Fall to another series, it would have to be to Broadchurch. Although they are similar in tone, The Fall has more depth within its characters. There is not much knowledge about the characters given, but through the series, you catch how interconnected their lives are.
