In the same fashion as so many other excellent BBC dramas, ("Downton", "Broadchurch", "Selfridges", "Call the Midwife", so on and so forth) this show is/was... well... excellent all the way around. Superb acting and directing; this show - once again, like a lot of other BBC offerings - has a terrific blend of sophisticated camera work, music, and everything else that goes into quality film making. The plot kept me guessing and I enjoyed the way it went off into several sub-plots while the main crux played out. Spotted it on Netflix and sure glad I perchance gave it a shot.(Question; Why just 5 episodes and more importantly - will there be more?)
