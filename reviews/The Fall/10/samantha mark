Incredible script, incredible acting, incredible direction, incredible producing the best programme my husband and I have watched in so many years - I am hoping there is an series 2 and beyond

we were drawn so far into the story line - sat on the edge of our seats - this is the most perfectly executed programme I have seen - EVER!!

Jamie Dornan was beyond words amazing - he had us feeling sorry for him - almost hoping he would not get caught - he had compassion yet an evil streak in him that was very alluring - as said previously perfectly executed script and acting to have this affect.

I would give this series a 11 if possible.
