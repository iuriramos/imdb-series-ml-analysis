Wow!

Just got done watching the entire second season (finally!). This is an excellent series that keeps you at the edge of your seat every episode. The actors are intense and each plays their role to perfection. We don't have to guess who the bad guy is and this is what makes "The Fall" an instant classic. We get to see inside the mind of a sicko and the authorities that are out to catch him. Bringing in the family adds to the suspense, as we all know what's going on, but they are oblivious. It is slow at times? Yes, but that adds to the allure of this excellent series. I don't rate everything I watch, but this time I have to. Binge watch away!
