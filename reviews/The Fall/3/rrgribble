This series started out well and as time progressed it was clear the writer lost the plot trying to stretch out the series. This is not a topnotch crime thriller as rated by many, but a bland analysis on how not to lead a major crimes investigation. The series is an insult to police women and women in general and policing in Ireland. There are so many holes in general policing practises and procedures. The character portrayed by Anderson is shallow and detracts from what could have been a good story. The second season degrades from thriller to frustration and quickly becomes a snooze fest. Jamie Dornan's acting in the series is very good, but is not enough to elevate a series with trite plot.
