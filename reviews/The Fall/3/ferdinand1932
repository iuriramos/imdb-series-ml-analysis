The interest and commentary for this series is at odds with the product. This has been done often and in similar guises since the genre proved a money-spinner in the early nineties.

The psychological police process drama of such a story is hackneyed to the point where it has a template for the writer to choose options and even dialog.

Why was it popular? Hard to say. Apart from the perp there are only about three male actors, the acting ensemble is largely female and led by a TV star. That statistically may be a reason and no reason why not; men like male-themed films and TV for the same reason.

It may have moved things a bit in terms of female/male portrayals but that is moot. Gillian Anderson is photogenic but her performance is copied wholesale from Charles Bronson. Perhaps the right eyebrow will rise in the second series? We can but hope for such a range of technical acting skill and raw emotion on the screen.

The production is high quality and the city location adds another layer of tension, or should that be, adds the only layer of tension as the bulk of the piece has already been seen sometime in 1994.
