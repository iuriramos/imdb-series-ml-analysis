Gillian Anderson is more a therapist with a sexual urge on the side to keep her going. She feels emancipated having sex when she is in control - a kind when a star detective gets after solving a case. She is cold, slow and deliberate towards the victims and always alive, refreshed with men around her, and attracts an odd women too. Therefore much of the story revolves around her living her life and the killer is on the loose. She gets off elsewhere while is the case is running rife! The twain have never met - not even in mind...yet. After a few episodes, there aren't many substantial leads that this so called 'SIO' has. This is drama at its best - I have to give credit where credit it due....but hurts my intelligence to watch it. While I prefer and still watch Euro crime drama a lot more to American ones - this is is overrated. Having Anderson as lead was a mistake, IMO. Daring close ups reveal the wrinkles on her face - showing experience, none of which have boiled down to the story line..more on to the bed! X-files was enough with pretend-police work. She should use her talents elsewhere instead.I had high expectations, but this one seems to deliver little less...Maybe, just maybe if she gets off more solving murders...it would turn me on!!
