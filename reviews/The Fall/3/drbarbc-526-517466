Gillian Anderson plays some so-called sexy cougar detective in this show. Her one-time lover says "you have no idea the effect you have on men..." Problem is: if you want an actress to play that role, she should be sexy herself. But Anderson's forehead is freaky flat, she NEVER smiles and has ZERO sex appeal. A Botox overdose failure. Why cast her in this role? Bad choice. She struts through this entire series as if every man should be melting in her presence. Really? To top that off, her acting is atrocious. It is like watching someone read a script. I will re-watch a few episodes of X-Files to see if she was always such a horrible actress. I was quite young when I watched it, so I wouldn't have noticed. Overall, the show might have been good but Anderson killed it.
