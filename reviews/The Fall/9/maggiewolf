Intriguing characters, beautiful cinematography, realistic dialog and a good basic story all compelled me to watch the entire 2014 season. Gillian Anderson plays a calm, cool, and collected Superintendent DI who instills confidence with a splash of envy in all her police entourage as well as her audience. Jamie Dornan plays the egocentric criminal with modest arrogance, a contradiction that seems simply genuine. The story builds through character development, illuminating a common thread running between criminal and cop: the human need for achieving control. Both cop and criminal maintain low-key demeanors, making the pace of the show drag in some places, but creating an overall feeling of intensity that kept me on the edge of my seat. However, the story falters with several instances of questionable police protocol. I have never worked in a police department, but I doubt any police department would assign 10 to 20 plainclothes police to tail a suspect while, simultaneously, only 2 to 4 uniformed officers are available to respond to street crimes. Technical goofs like this make the whole story less plausible. Instead of "Deus ex machina", we have "cops do dumb stuff", allowing the author to add a new twist (or is it just stretching out the story?). More's the pity when a show this promising comes along. Next season, Mr. Cubitt, hire three technical consultants and make it real.
