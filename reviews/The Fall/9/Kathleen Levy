One thing I like about British detective series is they portray believable characters. Unlike American detectives who dress in sexy garb as if they are going out for a night on the town, the female detectives in British shows are just as gritty and appropriately dressed as the men. The characters are more complex because of their imperfections. The female cops aren't all super heroes like so many Hollywood portrayed female cops. They have wrinkles, a few gray hairs, foibles and quirks. 

The same can be said for their villains. Even though they do evil things, they can also exhibit a more normal and even compassionate side. All the more frightening because they could be your neighbor, co-worker, or even your spouse and you'd never suspect them.

This series pits two great hunters against one another. Gillian Anderson as Stella Gibson and the very handsome Jamie Dornan as Paul Spector are a well suited match. Watching these two characters, you realize that there is very little difference between the two hunters except for their reasons for hunting and their control over their impulses. They understand each other and toy with one another towards the end of the first season and beyond. This show exhibits a greater insight into the thought processes of a killer.

It can be a slow paced show but well worth the wait. Just when you start to become bored, something exciting happens to pull you into the story and keep you watching. There are plenty of twists and turns involving peripheral characters that make you wonder how it will all fit together in the end. It is better and more realistic than anything on American television because the characters and the crimes are so believable.
