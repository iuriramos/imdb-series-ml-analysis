Well written, excellent cinematography, keeps you hooked and on the edge of your seat. Characters are complex, and not predictable, also developed as the plot develops. Certainly there are some details that are not believable, mistakes that you don't think a serial killer would make, but they are easily overcome because of the writing and character development, and th eeriness of the storyline. If you want a comparison, think of Dexter or The Killing. Not much humor in the daily on goings of the characters, Very dark and serious, don't know if that's more common in Irish series. But you certainly want to keep watching it.
