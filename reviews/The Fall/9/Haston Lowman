Gillian Anderson is an excellent choice as lead detective in this series about her pursuit of a serial killer. The show also follows the life of the serial killer giving the audience an inside look that is rare and quite similar to Hannibal, but less dramatic in a good way. Ironically Gillian Anderson also has a prominent role in Hannibal as his personal Psychiatrist. I wish there were more shows like this on television, but I fear that the average person is more drawn to less sophisticated programming. At times it seems a bit slow, but the characters are so interesting it really doesn't bother me at all. I have yet to notice any glaring wholes in the writing and quite honestly the filming and cinematography is excellent! I pray this show is on for many more seasons to come, often though it is this type of show with all its perfection that gets cut short... let's keep our fingers crossed... they did at least get a 2nd Season.
