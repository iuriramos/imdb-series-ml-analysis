This is one of the best programs that I have watched in recent times. Suspenseful and frightening. I really like that it does not rush the story and that we are privy to the killer from the start. Both he and Gillian are amazing. They are the two sides of a single coin. Both cold, calculating methodical and brilliant. It is a dark series so those who might prefer more of the fluff coming out of the US will probably not care for this series. Have just watched episode 3 and am really looking forward to next weeks. I also like that it is set in Ireland and not in North America and lacks the car and gun chases that frequent dramas in North America. The acting is superb.
