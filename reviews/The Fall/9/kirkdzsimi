Dark, compulsive viewing. Great cast and excellently put together.

Jamie Dornan as Paul Spector is a terrifyingly calm and methodical serial killer and we are under no illusions as to what he is from the very start. This reminds me of the superlatively good "Cracker", where the viewer also learned from the outset who the culprit was but got the chance to sample the murderer's twisted fantasies and complex motivations through the superbly written and directed action and dialogue in a way that 8 seasons of Dexter did not quite achieve even despite having Dexter's voice-overs to clear up

While Dexter was great I am trying to get across how much more gritty, dirty and realistic good British drama can be than its less demanding and more accessible American counterparts and The Fall epitomises that perfectly.

John Lynch plays the police chief with the beautiful brooding tragedy that has been his trademark for several decades and Gillian Anderson plays the beautiful but cold SIO who is as cold and unempathetic as the killer himself.

It should also be pointed out to previous reviewers Stateside that Anderson's well spoken southern English accent was flawless as it is in all British dramas that she does.

I would have liked to see a bit more of Robbie Coltrane "post-match analysis" but in a way the ending, while not to many people's taste, was refreshingly different at least and I look forward to the next series with relish.
