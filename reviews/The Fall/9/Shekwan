The Fall follows a serial killer in Belfast and the police force trying to catch him.

The series has a definite Scandi Noir feel to it from the beautiful greyscale cinematography and elements of harsh realism that get under your skin. There are no cheap Hollywood horror tricks, no suspenseful string refrains or CGI. The acting and screen writing speaks for itself in its honesty. The political and sociological themes are extremely well addressed and add a fascinating element to the examination of human nature, which ultimately is what the series is about.

The show is masterfully scripted, shot and the acting is on point. Both Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan perform their lead with effortless grace and conviction, but what truly surprises is the incredible standard of the supporting actors. John Lynch as Jim Burns, Bronagh Waugh as Sally Ann Spector and Aisling Francioci in particular deserve a mention.
