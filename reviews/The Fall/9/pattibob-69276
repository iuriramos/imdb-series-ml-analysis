After Breaking Bad it seemed there was no other series that had my attention including House of Cards. We stumbled on this series by accident and now can't stop watching. Anderson was a favorite of mine since the X-Files and takes on a similar serious persona in this series but different. The series does move slow at times, but definitely keeps your attention enough to want to see what happens on the next episode. Many of the main characters are Irish and sometimes the accent is hard to understand but the actor who plays the serial killer is stellar in his performance and keeps you wondering how in the world he is getting by without being caught. He is convincingly accurate in the personality of his character and found myself completely irritated that he wasn't caught sooner. Am wondering if this series will move Anderson on to chasing other despicable characters or if the series will continue with the present plot. Currently the series only has two seasons.
