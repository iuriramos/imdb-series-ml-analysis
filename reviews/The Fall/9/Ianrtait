I have really enjoyed the first 2 episodes. It is interesting, dark and detailed with real people and real issues. It unfolds slowly but surely but inevitably.

It is set in Belfast and always has a dark feel.

The script takes the time to detail all of the lives of the main characters not just gloss over them.

The UK knows how to tell a great story with realism.

The cast is very strong and Gillian Anderson is outstanding in this different style of role. 

Well worth watching.
