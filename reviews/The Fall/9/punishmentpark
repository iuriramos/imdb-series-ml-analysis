Sure, there are some coincidences here and there that feel a little too contrived (for instance: what are the odds of Paul taking so much time in Stella's hotel room ánd Jim coming by that very night?), but the big pluses of this series make me very forgiving.

I loved the dark atmosphere of the whole (a fierce serial killer who pretends to be a good father played very well by Jamie Dornan^, good 'old' Gillian Anderson as a somewhat troubled investigator, Belfast itself), even when the first season seemed a little more intense than the second. As far as all the issues that were addressed go, 'The fall' takes on a whole lot, but never strays too far from the main story.

It's been a while since a TV-series drew me in like this one did, and I'm really looking forward to a new season, ánd watching the first two again not before long!

9 out of 10.

^ Didn't know he also did the lead in 'FiShOGr', but there it is...
