So far I've only watched the first three episodes and I'm looking forward to finishing season 1 today. I love the show so far. I like the slower pace and the focus on various story lines. My husband came home when I was in the middle of episode 1 and he was confused as to why we already knew who the killer is. He thought that it couldn't possibly be good since the 'mystery' was already taken away but he ended up watching the next two episodes with me. Even he got hooked. I love that we know who the killer is right away because we can see what he does leading up to the murder and try to find the signs in his life that everyone else is obviously missing (I would miss them too if I didn't already know that he's a serial killer!). To me this show exerts a different kind of terror because he seems like so many other people. He even seems respectable on the surface with a good career (as a grief counselor!) and a wife and kids.

I wish more shows today were like this. I've had a hard time lately finding a show that I can really get into but I'm already hooked on this one and looking forward to the next season.

On a side note other women must be more trusting than me because when we watched a scene with the nanny I told my husband that there's no way I would hire a cute 15 year old nanny and leave her alone with my husband!
