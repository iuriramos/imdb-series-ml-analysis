This show, as many British shows, takes its time developing. It's not in a rush like American TV. 

This happens to be one reason why I like British television. Anyway, this show scared the bejesus out of me showing everything in such stark, real detail. 

It's very very scary to see someone who has such an ordinary life (wife, kids, job) being such an evil person on the inside. 

Anyway, if you like British television and you like VERY DARK shows, this show will probably rock your socks off. Me? I don't know if I can handle how dark it is in spite of its excellence.
