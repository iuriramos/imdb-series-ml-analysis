Fantastic acting - suspenseful! I would have given it a 10/10 but some places it was like - why didn't the police do this or that (kind of obvious things) For example - it was obvious that the wife beater should have been arrested and in jail after the scene where he finds and beats up his ex-wife. At that point, when he ran off - well you just knew he was going to be the one to stop Paul Spector in the end. That was the biggest let-down. So the end was no surprise. But overall - the series was excellent! The shooting of the scenes - slow pace. It was great to watch the relationships develop or should I see unravel. The writers just knew certainly know something about what dysfunctional people feel & think. And to be able to get that across to the viewers - well what a great job they did. it's oddly enough - HEALING to watch - although I can see how it might be a trigger for others. But you begin to understand why abusers become the monsters they are. Understand but of course not accept. I was hanging on to the end waiting to know Spector's story. The shots between Stella and Spector were great. The words/thoughts exchanged between the two of them. A lot of realism. Humanizing the bad person and having the audience feel empathy for him - ugh! Then you kind of find out Stella's reasons for hating men - and only Spector seemed to understand. Poor ol' Spector. You come away with the feeling the guy really tried to hold off on his madness. And just like Bonnie and Clyde or Charles Manson - there is an odd infatuated teenager who falls for Spector. A loyal disciple. The viewer keeps getting drawn into each episode. A lot of tired days at work for trying to squeeze as many shows in one night. (WWWAAAaaa - there are no more to watch) Terrific acting and terrific writing- can't wait for the third season. in the mean time -- Stella please heal thyself. You really deserve better :)
