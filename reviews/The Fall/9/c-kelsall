This series had me gripped from start to finish, and I couldn't be happier that a second series has been green-lit. As a senior police officer leads the hunt for a serial killer in Belfast, we see the similarities in these two amoral protagonists. The story unfolds with an economy of scene structure which never omits important details; every scene drives the narrative, but it never feels unreal or stretches credulity. Beautifully paced, tension abounds with spine-tingling murder scenes. The characters are very well written, and played with pitch-perfect performances from the leads, Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. Another reviewer on this strand didn't like the ending, but for me it was spot on. The story took the time to include complexities and unresolved events which are reflective of real life. Are we to castigate every TV show production team who leave a show on a cliffhanger ending to give them somewhere to go with the next series? If the next one carries the universally excellent production values of the first, then I for one can't wait.
