Why a 9, well the last episode left me a bit upset (to say the least). This story was written with Gillian in mind for the main role, once she agreed then the writing took off & more episodes were generated. I have noticed that a lot of reviewers did not like this series, whats not to like. Gillian's character is so unassuming & has absolutely no idea what she is doing to the male characters around her.....or does she? Paul was so calculating & clever just what you want from a vicious serial killer with a unique sense of wrong & right that only applies to him. The cast is excellent & the graphic nature of the series really made me feel like it was written for an adult audience & not for the teenage population that so many drama's are written for. To end I will say this, the storyline may be done a million times before but this had so many layers it had me thinking & discussing the angles with my wife for days after. Well done to all involved for a staggering drama for adults.
