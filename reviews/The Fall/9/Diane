This is my first ever review and I'm glad it's started with my thoughts about The Fall which in my eyes was the best thriller series ever. I thoroughly enjoyed this show, brilliant and believable acting, cast and storyline. I was gripped from start to finish and enjoyed the emotional journey this series took me on. The relationship between the two main characters Stella and Paul was enthralling, all the characters made the thriller jigsaw puzzle complete, there wasn't anything that I thought was surplus to the storyline. However, I do agree with a previous review in that I would of given 10/10 if they didn't end the last episode with a cliffhanger...I just needed one more scene to satisfy my appetite and tie up the loose ends but other than that it was truly excellent and I cannot recommend it enough!
