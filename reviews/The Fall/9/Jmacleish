I don't leave many reviews, and I don't use the word "beautiful" much... and a strange word to use in a serial killer/crime drama - but you have to credit the balance here of storytelling, acting and direction. To me this is beautiful. I'm late to the "The Fall" party, only started watching last week but I am approaching the end of series 2 fast. I can't stop watching. This is a real world crime drama that works and the realism is abject. The story is clever enough, not entirely original but what is entirely original anyway? I'm not going to go into the plot (I'm sure you've guessed it) and that's not the stand out reason I'm writing this. It's the delivery. The lighting/direction is masterful, the plot is blood drainingly tense and the acting is superb - not just Gillian Anderson or Jamie Dornan (who are both brilliant) but the entire cast including the kids are exceptional. Well played the writer(s), director and all involved. More please :-)
