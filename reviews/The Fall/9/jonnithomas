This is a very strong and realistic serial killer drama.

It has been criticised for being 'too slow' and for Gillian Anderson not having a good English accent. These criticisms are laughable and shallow in the extreme.

GA grew up in England from the age of 2. She has lived in England for well over 10 years as an adult. She doesn't do a Dick Van Dyke mock accent well, she speaks as a middle classed English woman which is basically what she is !!! England is her home.

As for it being 'too slow'... it isn't as it builds and shows strong characterisation without spoon feeding the story in the way so many American series do.

The subject matter is unpleasant and the presentation of it is very very real. It isn't a relaxing program to watch with a cup of warm cocoa. It is gut wrenching and harrowing. It is set in Belfast and shows the city and it's people in stark grainy reality. I have worked there, it's realistic.

All the acting is to a very high standard and the writing is excellent. The director has presented things in a very chilling manner with solid fully 3d characters.

This program isn't for the hard of thinking that believe a Big Mac is a quality evening meal to be washed down with a can of pop and high comedy is repeated farts. If your favourite cop series was starsky and hutch or the professionals then it probably isn't for you. you won't understand or appreciate it.

I cannot praise this series enough. If you have the time watch it. If you haven't got the time then make some. Personally I can't wait for series 2.
