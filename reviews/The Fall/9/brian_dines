In some ways, I think we're in a golden age of TV, with movie actors unhappy about limited and stupid roles in film working out their craft in well-written dramas like "The Fall". I just started watching this a few weeks ago, but I'm hooked and I hope there's another season coming. 

Gillian Anderson is amazing in this. Her accent sounds good, the acting is great and the other major characters are all lending genuine quality. This one goes down in my book along with shows like "Banshee", "the Good Wife", "Suits", "House of Cards", "The Walking Dead" and other quality shows that don't insult the intelligence of the viewers, bringing adult-ish stories to the little screen. The fact that this is set in Belfast helps with the intrigue.

I'm Happy I stumbled onto this show.
