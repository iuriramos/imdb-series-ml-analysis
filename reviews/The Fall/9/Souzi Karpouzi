"The Fall" is a very well filmed and developed story. The acting of all the cast is accurate and right where it needs to be. No more, no less. 

For all of you that are used to the fast paced American type of the genre and everything that it includes, the directing will seem a bit/quite slow. 

But actually it is not because it is very realistic. Real serial, real police people, real police building, with no unnecessary details, no unnecessary high tech gadgets or theatrics. It is purely European (british-irish) style. 

So, do watch it for what it is and not for what you are used to and what it is not.

This is an addition for the second season of the show. The review remains the same except the pace of the episodes. In comparison with the first season they have become faster and tighter. The second season is more personal for both the leading characters. The ending was somewhat ambivalent and can definitely bring a third season if so decided from all parties.

Gillian Anderson's performance was even better than the first season. Jamie Dornan's as well. Everything was just as good and a little bit better. In conclusion "The Fall" is TV at its best!
