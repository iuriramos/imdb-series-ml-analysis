Oh my but this is just very, very good. Whilst not a 10/10 like Broadchurch, in my mind the 'gold standard' of TV, it is simply excellent. The psychopath here is beyond chilling, at times quite uncomfortable to watch. This is one of those shows that leaves you talking about it after each episode. 'How can she not know?' 

The back drop of Belfast and the relationship with the UK is also very well drawn and a reminder of the push-pull between the two. It adds to the story quite brilliantly but might be confusing for Americans.

You want to keep watching and keep watching, in this regard it equals 'Breaking Bad' but it is the details that the Director nails. When the victim see's the psycho take off his mask and knows right there that she is going to die, it is chilling to the bone.

Watch it. Brilliant.
