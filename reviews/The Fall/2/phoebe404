OMG...where do I start. Slow. I have read all the reviews and wondered....what are they watching? This is no Prime Suspect. Bad acting, bad scripts and no redeeming value. I have watched all the episodes in order. Again, I still don't understand what is going on. And GA's really BAD English accent is an insult to all! I have read that so many of you think this is her break out....sorry, not even close. No acting here, just phoned in the character. Someone, please tell me why this is a great series????? If this is to be the next Helen Mirren....well, not even close. I am so disappointed and still trying to figure out the plot!!!! I will seek internet help to figure out what is going on....perhaps that will clear up the mystery!!!

Bad, bad, bad!!!
