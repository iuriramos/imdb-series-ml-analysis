I don't know why everyone gives high praise to this lame series; if the main purpose of it was to show Gillian Anderson's wardrobe and an unbelievably clownish incompetence of an entire police operation, then yes, it gets a 10 at that. More than half the show the police are made look like stupid monkeys by a serial killer which is not doing anything special to anticipate or outmaneuver them. It's not like the killer has an extremely elaborate plan or is playing with them; no! It's just that the police are scripted to be plain stupid! At one point they have found their main suspect and he is in close range to them, but they still let him stroll right under their noses without making the first move (and no, the clich√© of "let's leave him make his move so he takes us closer to where he is hiding the victim" is not even well developed to justify that dumb approach).

And the other half of the series is to show Anderson's wardrobe and lust, which in the end has NOTHING to do with anything from the case; it's not even that the series is deep in character development, it's like the screenwriter thought "hey! Let's portray Gibson like a hungry cougar that takes to bed anything/anyone that stands near her. Oh! and let's include a lesbian kiss! yeah! Homosexuality out of the nothing should raise the ratings! ::genius::" I mean, Gillian Anderson is not even attractive enough to fit the role of a woman who is desired by everyone...

A female detective who wears skirts, unbuttoned up to the cleavage silk blouses and 4 inches high heels to a crime scene on a muddy road by the country side... Seriously?????
