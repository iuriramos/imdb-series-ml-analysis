It gets one extra star from me for being a well made (with one critical exception) good story, but easily loses the other 8 because the whole story (both series combined) could have been told in a four episode mini-series, in which it might have been entertaining. Every single scene was edited abominably Â– At least 80% of it should have been edited out, including a lot of entirely redundant scenes. The Fall isn't really entertaining; instead because it's too slow it's an assault on your free time that is barely intriguing enough to keep you watching (if you're unlucky). It just doesn't provide enough value for your time by a long long way. I wish that I'd never started watching and I'm only wasting my time reviewing it now through pure altruism in the hope that anyone reading this will think again about buying the boxed set.
