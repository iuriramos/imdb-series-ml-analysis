This TV series was horrible disappointment for a number of reasons.

1- 5 hours of watching the same incessant thing over and over with no resolution to ANY issue. I never expected that. 2- A septic actress with a lousy British accent and a drip of a personality. She couldn't act her way out of a paper bag and was as boring as a snail in my backyard 3- continued, unnecessary bad shots from overhead for arts sake. 4- too frequent scene changes that are short and abrupt

I enjoyed the backdrop of Belfast and the fact it did not deal with IRA type issues. It was refreshing in this sense. They should have focused a bit more on corruption within the police rather than just the serial killer.

Jamie Dornan is great as the serial killer. 

I certainly will not "FALL" into the trap of watching series 2.
