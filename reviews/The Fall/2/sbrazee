This show is beyond garbage. I wont give it away for the few that actually want to get sucked into the pure half ass written show but just like lost you will have a million questions and a totally pointless crap stupid ending where nothing really mattered to begin with. The acting was OK at best on top of it all. Gillian Andersons attempt at a British accent is funny and annoying at the same time. None of the performances really stand out. The serial killer is a handsome fit guy married to a fat pig which has many scratching their head. There are other very questionable pair ups but at this point who cares
