The Fall is the most un-original, uninspiring show i'v seen in a long, long time.

Lets start with the storyline; (if you'd call it that) this is a simple serial killer show, the killer you know right from the start so there goes the 'who dunnit' element. There is no attempt from the writers to let you like or hate the villain and the same can be said of the detective trying to catch him. There is no profiling of the killer and to be honest the whole show could have and should have been condensed into a 1 hour episode. Anyone who has seen The Wire will be very unimpressed with this attempt of a show.

By the way, the acting is as poor as the story line, rarely will you see so many wooden actors in one show.

Couldn't be more disappointed with this... and of course it's getting another series!! unbelievable!
