The only difference are Hannibal owned his action, and has more control. And also Hannibal is a cannibal and Paul is a pervert. First season was great, second one, i think it's just dragging too long. Also there is sexism, where male cops look dumb and every dumb male cop objectifying Gillian Anderson's character.....and lesbians. And is that supposed to make people keep interested in the series? For me, it was Jaime Dornan, the Mr. Christian Grey, from fifty shades of Grey, no wonder he got that part, i guess he got the tying the knot done from this series! Lol what else to say. Well there are better crime drama series, like CSI, that's why I am very picky how the series goes, although I did enjoy the first one, and this series should have done as mini series.
