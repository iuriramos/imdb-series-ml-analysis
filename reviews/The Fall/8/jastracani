Despite the plethora of cop shows out there, there are very few of them that capture gritty realism and tell a story with a gripping, slow-burn pacing the way "The Fall" does. I like to compare it to the American cop show "The Killing," which has a similar vibe and pacing. Only thing that disappoints me, is the show's location. Belfast is a beautiful city that is rich in history, both tragic (Titanic and the Troubles) and inspirational (the Industrial Revolution, the recent peace and economic boom). But very few of Belfast's landmarks or neighborhoods are featured in the show, and very little of its history is reflected in the plot. The show might as well take place in any United Kingdom city and still not lose anything of value. Still, it is a small gripe and it does not take away from that fact that Belfast is becoming a place that's friendly to filmmakers and a hotbed for excellent actors.
