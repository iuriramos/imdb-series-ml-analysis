Its interesting to observe how different the UK and USA treat serial killers who are almost always psychopathic in their thinking. The USA like to analyse their characters, but the British want to brand them as just evil, in order to distance themselves from them and their behaviour. The Fall is very good drama, and Gillian Andersons style of acting, very brave, in that the poise she exhibits holds her under scrutiny for longer, which requires a very confident actress. It would have been more interesting if a psychiatrist had been included in the drama, as would have most certainly been done in the USA. As it was characters were presented purely for dramatic effect and motives hinted at without professional input.
