For some odd reason there aren't a lot of psychological crime thrillers on US television, and I seem to be okay with it. Why? Because BBC fulfills that want with gripping, high-quality, crime dramas. The Fall is extraordinarily real, scary, compelling, and just outright excellent! Jamie Dornan delivers a performance that rivals to Ruth Wilson's, Alice Morgan, in Luther. However, Jamie is far more darker and closeted with his emotions. At times one almost feels empathy for him, and that is not right (he's a serial killer for goodness sakes!).

Gillian Anderson plays the detective hunting Jamie Dornan's character. She, too, is controlling, dominant, intelligent and somewhat heartless. Although Gillian Anderson's character is aggressive and seeks respect for women, Mrs. Anderson plays the role in a way that the character doesn't come across as overbearing or a woman who has a feminist agenda.

The only issues that I have with the show is: the dual storyline involving the death of a fellow police officer and the widow of one of the victim's of Jamie Dornan's character, and the absurdity of a fifteen year old always being home alone when Jamie Dornan's character comes to her house. I find it distracting at times. I'm selfish, I guess. I only want to watch the storyline involving Mr. Dornan's character and the detectives chasing him down.

I highly recommend this show if you like to see how lines can get blurred when someone chooses to act on his or her fantasies that are not considered sane by most of society. It makes you ask the question: How does a person become the person that most people loathe-a murderer.
