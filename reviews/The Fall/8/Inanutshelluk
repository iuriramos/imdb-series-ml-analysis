Spector (J.Dornan) vs Gibson (G.Anderson) return for Series 3 of the acclaimed crime drama The Fall and what started off as a slow burner has quickly turned into a fiery concoction of tension, darkness & eeriness....Back on form you could say! The next episode screens tonight on BBC2, however, if you're new to The Fall we'd highly recommend you start with Seasons 1 first.

For fans of: Happy Valley, Luther, The Killing, The Missing, Broadchurch.

Geek fact: The naming of the characters along with some business & place names are legendary guitars (Gibson, Spector, Burns, Stagg).
