Very well acted by the two leads, and yes, Gillian is hot.

It's nice to see a drama set in Belfast for a change, and I suppose the 2nd series will be in a Scottish city. I hope it isn't Edinburgh because, although I love that city there needs to be a change from the usual British sites (London, in particular).

Ms Anderson has shown great form on UK dramas: she was terrific in Bleak House. I cannot understand some of the criticism over her British accent. It's not at all false, and she has spent half of her life here, including her childhood.

There were glaring faults in the plot. How the killer could be so careful on one hand and then utterly amateurish on the other beats me. And the ending was ridiculous. Still, I'm hoping they will take note and make the next series more believable.
