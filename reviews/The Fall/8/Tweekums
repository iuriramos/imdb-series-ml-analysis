Set in Belfast this drama followed the lives of two people; one a serial killer called Paul Spector, the other; Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson; the police officer in charge of the case. We see how the apparently charming Spector selects his victims, lays in wait for them in their own homes then brutally attacks them and leaves their bodies posed before returning home to his wife and children. On the other side Gibson is outwardly selfish; she has barely set foot in the province before she is inviting another officer to spend the night with herÂ… she is clearly used to getting what she wants and what she wants most is to catch the killer. 

This drama was rather unusual as we know who the killer is from the start; the only question is will his pursuer catch? Gillian Anderson does a fine job as Gibson although it is Jamie Dornan who plays Spector who stands out here; he does a great job believably portraying a man who is a vicious killer some of the time but a caring family man at home. As the series approaches its conclusion it becomes clear just how manipulative the character is as he persuades his wife to believe that he lied to the police because he had done something shameful rather than let it come out that he was the killer. The biggest surprise of this first series was the ending; although it did set things up for another series.

The Belfast setting added to the drama; it may be in the UK but it is clear that policing here isn't like in the rest of the country; our heroine must undergo firearms training that wouldn't be required on the mainland and the killer has to worry about upsetting the loyalists on the Shankhill Road in the course of his job.

Overall I'd say this series was well worth watching although I wish it had been longer so we could have got a conclusion rather than having to wait ages to find out what happens.
