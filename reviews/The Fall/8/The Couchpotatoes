Now this is the kind of television series I like. A nice thriller that makes you want to watch the next episode immediately. I saw the two seasons in only a week time. That's how much I liked it. The absolute star is Jamie Dornan (as Paul Spector). He completely nailed it as the normal day-to-day person and sexual predator. It was really a joy to watch his performance. It could be anybody, it could be your neighbor. I was wondering about Gillian Anderson, because when you think about her you obviously going to think about Scully from The X-Files. Her acting was not bad but not stunning either. Like I said before it's all about Jamie Dornan to me in The Fall. The storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat during all episodes. I really enjoyed it and will surely watch it again in the future.
