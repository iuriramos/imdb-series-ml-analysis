The acting and photography in this production are both outstanding. The story demonstrates that serial killers are not unique to any one country. What is lacking in many areas is adequately trained and competent police to deal with them. In this case the Police Service of Northern Ireland seems perfectly capable of the task. The killer like many of his ilk has the ability to appear perfectly normal while committing abhorrent crimes. Spector who is seriously wounded during the final episode may well survive his wounds and perhaps escape? Will Supt.Gibson develop some warped (love hate) relationship with him? We must remember that he has read her diary and is aware of something dark in her past. Looking forward to season 3.
