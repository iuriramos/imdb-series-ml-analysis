When deciding whether or not I should start this series, I was a little skeptical just because this main plot is a very common one. I absolutely loved Dexter, so I decided to try it out. Despite the basic similarities in the two titles, they are nothing alike. The Fall is definitely a very slow series, while Dexter seemed to keep me hooked with its fast paced intensity. After watching a couple of episodes of The Fall, I quit watching for a week or two, and almost gave up on it completely. I eventually decided to give it another chance, and am very happy that I did. Despite the many slow moments, there is an underlying feeling of extreme suspense. The game of cat and mouse kept me wondering how it would all turn out. The last two episodes, though, were definitely the best of the whole series. They had a much faster pace, and it seemed as if the ball was finally rolling. I do hope the tap into this for the next season(s).
