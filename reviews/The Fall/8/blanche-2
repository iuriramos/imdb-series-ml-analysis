First let me say I never saw one episode of X-Files. I have only seen Gillian Anderson in "The House of Mirth," a period piece. Here she stars as the head of a Belfast investigation in "The Fall." Anderson plays Stella Gibson, sent to head up the investigation of a series of murders. It doesn't take her long to realize that they're linked.

We see who the killer is, so there's no mystery there. What is intriguing is the psychology both of the killer and Stella. The killer becomes obsessed with her as he grows to hate her - she knows too much about him, and it's made him angry. So he makes it his business to know too much about her.

We feel that Stella has a back story, a tragedy in her life - we aren't told what it is, but it's there. She gives away nothing. In the entire first two seasons, she has one moment of real emotion.

I found the performance of Gillian Anderson mind-blowing. Colder than ice and professional, she's a woman who goes after sex the way a man does and makes no bones about it. She's detached from her team -- it's only late in the game when she shows a sign of friendship toward any of them. 

Great to see one of my favorites, Archie Panjabi, in this as a medical examiner.

I don't want to give too much away. The story is multi-layered, the characters complicated. I'll just say the story is absorbing and intriguing, and the acting from everyone is wonderful, particularly Anderson, Jamie Dornan, Bronagh Waugh, and John Lynch.

Looking forward to series 3.
