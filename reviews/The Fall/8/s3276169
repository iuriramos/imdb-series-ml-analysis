The Fall is a crime thriller set in Northern Ireland. A serial killer pursued by a driven female lead detective brought in from London based on her experience and expertise in leading investigations into serial crimes. 

Both key characters have issues. The killer is obsessed with a specific type of woman whilst the female lead detective has an obsessive need to bed younger men who fit a certain profile. 

Its a disturbing drama. It not only looks at the crimes but also the fall out for those touched by them. The family of the serial killer, a young girl who becomes obsessed with the killer and to a lesser degree the families of the victims and the police seeking to catch him. 

The main theme of this drama, for me at least, is the nature of obsession. What drives peoples predilections in a specific and often self destructive direction? 

The acting is top quality. Gillian Anderson does a great job as they tough female lead detective, whilst the killer, played by Jamie Dornan, is both charming, cold and calculating. 

Its an excellent series perhaps only let down a little by some of the rather inexplicable gaffs made by the highly intelligent killer. The sexual merry go round that revolves around Anderson's character also seems a little implausible at times too.

Eight out of ten from me.
