I have seen Gillian Anderson in a lot of stuff and I'm old enough to have watched her grow from a newbie TV fad into a fine actress. She plays this detached icy woman with all stops pulled and makes you still care for her. It's a dicey road at best to make the audience empathize with you and yet feel your aloofness and selfishness mess up other people around you. She is fab. I think Jamie Dornan is good as the sociopathic killer although I've seen him in other roles from his early years on and I can't help but feel he rides the wave as a pretty model boy who depends on his photogenic face and body for most of the time. It's obvious the cameraman was in lust with him in this one. I've never seen so many close ups of sensuous body parts in my life. It's as if the filmmaker wanted us to feel like we were making love to Jamie. I'm personally afraid of handsome people--too handsome that is. I think they are undeveloped, not necessarily their own fault. They've been fondled from birth and told by a million people how wonderful they are even if they just flushed a toilet. They feel and act 'special' but it's that quality that makes them stiff and unreal. This works as a sociopath but not so much in roles calling for human qualities. I think Jamie is most likely just like this character in real life minus (hopefully) the serial killer tendencies. It's his lack of acting ability that makes him so convincing here. He's most of the time on a runway walking in his tight little muscle defining outfits changing a lot and even enthralled in an attic with a mannequin (how Freudian). This part might have been written for him.
