I believe you all are aware of the quality of BBC productions. At a stretch just now finished another one of their brilliant installments The Fall - TV. The success of a psycho serial killing show depends on the depiction of showing the intensity of the fetish perversion of that killer. The Fall did that job meticulously. Beautiful n Gorgeous Gillian Anderson was the best thing that could happen to her role. There is an unique vibe and glitter in her presence that showcase a staggering personality, that is what called a real show !

The most perfect job that the show did was not exaggerating or over- qualifying the killer, nor glorifying or idolizing his motives. A serial killer always doesn't need to be recluse. He could a loving father to his children, a loving husband to his wife. He has to deal the redundancy and mundane clich√© of the day to day life. But at the same time he could do the 'Doubling' perfectly. But when the hunter meets his perfect opponent, he could really get 'hunted' ! The devil lies in the detail, stark-gory-scary detail. And the details of this series parts it from others. You wont feel rush like the traditional USA releases, it takes time to build the story in UK production. But less dramatization and raw nature of the fetish was something 'sickening to the stomach' was present here that you won't be able to deny. This is dark, really really 'DARK', and if you don't have the stomach for that, don't come near here !
