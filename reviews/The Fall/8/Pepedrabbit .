Warning ****May contain spoilers*** 

A police detective series not set in NY or LA, or even Paris or London, so it had my interest. I watched the entire five-part series in two sittings. I was hooked from the beginning. I could identify the multiple characters after the second time, something not normally easy for me.

I thought the killer was eerily good. He led a mundane normal everyday life. You can see why there wouldn't be any focus on him right away, even though there were some tense exchanges. His wife was an awesome, almost angelic beautiful woman who was the perfect contrast.

It was good to see so many fully bearded police officers, something not quite popular here in States, even though mustaches are quite common.

I thought Gillian Anderson was a weak choice as detective. She was just lifeless. Not that she needed to shout or break down doors, but that she gets lost in mix. This was a four-part series at best. At certain points, it was really slow and you wanted it to get moving. Certain scenes stretched two long. The ending really was crappy. Unless they knew the series would be renewed, it should have been wrapped up after these five episodes.
