I'm currently on season two episode three of the series, and I've grown to find it quite enjoyable/intriguing. I like how they use a lot of real forensics techniques or facts. Like how they lift tire impressions, rigor mortis, ways to figure out the time of death, etc. they also mentioned facts about serial killers personalities, and how they can be charismatic, and blend in with society. also in the first episode I think, there is a very cool tracking shot from the ceiling, which followed the handsome actor, Jamie Dornan, from room to room. I'm sure the camera trick was probably used in plenty of movies and shows, but it was my first time seeing it, and it was pretty cool.
