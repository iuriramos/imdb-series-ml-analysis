I just binged-watched all of season two(at least I think I did). It ended where a lot of you are either upset or confused. However, I liked the ending, leaves it open for season 3 and another shot at this killer. She was very concerned her hard work and risky field trip may have put an end to the beginning of her investigation, it's not over by a long shot. Anderson had on a vest, his risk of a fatal wound would be less likely than Spector's. 

I didn't know Jamie was from Ireland originally, makes this show all the more interesting and easier to believe.

Found "Katy" to be extremely scary. Too many unanswered questions for that to be the end of it all and not a season 3. Very well written and well acted.
