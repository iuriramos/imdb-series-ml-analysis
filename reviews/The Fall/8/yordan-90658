I stumbled upon "The Fall" by accident, and it was worth it-every minute! If you're into gore, or should we say, visual messy violence, this is not the show for you! It Is a little bit slow paced, but leads to agreat culmination. It raises all kinds of questions-real ones-what makes a murderer kill? How does the system work when dealing with psychopaths? Does the punishment meet the crime? It shows both sides-the side of the killer and the side of the police trying to catch him and bring him to justice. It's a deep story, one that looks very, very real-not like some horror shows that...well, you just know that what you're seeing is not possible, and it's not going to happen. Jamie Dornan does a great job (nothing to do with 50 shades of Grey), and Gillian Anderson is fantastic! Just see for yourself-if you like a dark story, with characters that have real problems-this one should do the job for you!
