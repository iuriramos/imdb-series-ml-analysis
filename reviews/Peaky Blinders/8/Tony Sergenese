So far this series is very entertaining. Plenty of action and different characters makes it easy to enjoy and pick a favorite. I did notice a HUGE ERROR in season 2 episode 4 that makes a large impact on the plot of future episodes. Canada was NEVER part of the prohibition laws followed by America, in fact they were the number 1 supplier of alcohol to America during that time. The following is a quote from Wikipedia; After Edward, Prince of Wales, returned to the United Kingdom following his tour of Canada in 1919, he recounted to his father, King George V, a ditty he had heard at a border town:

Four and twenty Yankees, feeling very dry, Went across the border to get a drink of rye. When the rye was opened, the Yanks began to sing, "God bless America, but God save the King!"[40]

I'm not sure how to forward this information to the writers of the show but it is in my eyes important to do so.
