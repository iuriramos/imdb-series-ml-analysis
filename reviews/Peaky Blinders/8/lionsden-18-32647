I hoped I had found a diamond in the rough, because I had not heard a lot of people who already knew it. I was not at all disappointed. Rough and filthy sort of scenery with good quality filming and acting to start with. Now I would advise everyone to keep watching, since the characters really do deepen throughout the episodes. Also for the ladies watching, we are not left out ;) !

In my opinion 'The Peaky Blinders' is making promising progress to being one of the big series of this time. 

Looking forward to the second season very much!
