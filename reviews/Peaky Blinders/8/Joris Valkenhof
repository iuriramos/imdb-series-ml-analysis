I must say, the first two episodes of the series were difficult to get through as it us more talking and less action, so I do understand the bad ratings. But for those who gave up after 1 or 2 episodes: those episodes sets up a continuation for the rest of the show, which is totally worth it.

I love everything of it. I am seriously blown away by the setting and how they created it. beautifully done. I also believe that the director used less coloration to give it a bit of a darker look.

As for writing: great job. No plot holes and if there are some, they'll get filled up in later episodes. The were a lot of things that left me questioned, but eventually, all the pieces of the puzzle will fall in place.

The acting is great as well. I have even more respect for Cillian Murphy after this show. I like how Ada shows her feminism, although it looks like every woman in this show is stepping up.

All in all, the director did a great job reflecting time and place for this era in history. Awesome work!
