It has been compared to Boardwalk Empire but that show knew how to follow through when a good ding-dong was required. This show kept walking up to the mark then retreating. Follow through and do something decisive that has consequences. The big showdown in the final episode, great build up then splat. It also had a Guy Ritchie vibe to it, which isn't a bad thing but then you realize how good his scripts are and how mediocre this script was, maybe that's a bit harsh, but it could have had a bit more pizazz, no need to be so sincere. Other than that great lead and atmosphere. I'm looking forward to the new series, especially with talk of Tom Hardy appearing in it. To hell with it, I'll change my 7 to an 8.
