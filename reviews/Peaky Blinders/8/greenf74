People will keep comparing this BBC series to "Boardwalk Empire" and "The Sopranos", but its lineage goes back well before those two shows. One would have thought the influence of Sergio Leone, Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola was rather more immediately discernible. The lettering of the credits, coupled with the anachronistic use of modern-day rock music for a series set in 1919, immediately recalls "Gangs Of New York", but that, of course, was conceived partially as an homage to the far superior "Once Upon A Time In America"; and the epic scope of Steven Knight's plot-line, with its archetypal characters, is very much along Leone lines. The family hierarchy of the Peaky Blinders can hardly fail to remind us of the Corleones, with the foul- mouthed, dim-witted oldest brother Arthur serving as a Fredo equivalent to Tommy Shelby's Michael. The notion of setting this operatic gangster saga in post-WW1 Birmingham is a piquant one, but maybe Steven Knight remembers a BBC series of the 1970s called "Gangsters"? That, too, had several different ethnic minorities involved in Brummie criminality. "Peaky Blinders" is, when one considers all the influences on it, perhaps not quite as brilliant as its admirers claim, but it is still pretty riveting. But maybe it should have been just the one series?
