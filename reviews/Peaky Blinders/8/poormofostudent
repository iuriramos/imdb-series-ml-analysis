This programme is pretty solid. It's a good replacement for Ripper St. which the BBC has regrettably tossed aside for now. I do like period flicks, but I think the Irish/gypsy thing is a bit of a stretch and historically questionable. Irish "gypsies" aren't gypsies like the rest of Europe (i.e. Roma). The Roma and Irish travellers share no common ethnicity, no common language, customs, etc. Yet, when the lead Blinder meets with the Queen Gypsy he speaks some Latin-based language presumably some Roma language, but the Gypsies are meant to be Irish. I'm not saying it couldn't/didn't happen, I just question the historic accuracy of this.
