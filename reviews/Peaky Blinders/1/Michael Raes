It took 2 episodes for me to skip all the rest. It's awful. It could have been good . Just replace the music, the stupid style, the cameraman. All those comparing this with Boardwalk , well open your eyes. Boardwalk was at least believable, had music that did fit and the acting and pacing was perfect even if being slow, because at that time there was still time available in life. Now they make a show which does reflects the same time-frame with music that does not fit and use stylistic camera-work that does not fit. What is worse is the overacting. Everybody is trying so hard.This is bad directing as well. There is so much talent on the floor and it is used in a wrong way. No sorry, not for me.
