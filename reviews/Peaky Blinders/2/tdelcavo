It is bizarre to represent EVERYONE as a chain smoker who never eats a bite of food. The creator(s) of this series are obviously smokers who want to legitimize their suicidal habit without any sense of reality. The drama is compelling, but it makes one wonder if there is any truth behind the story when there is not one character who has the intellect to resist nicotine and alcohol addictions. Anyone who engages in these self destructive habits would not win a fight, race, contest or competition in the long run with someone who nourishes his/her body. Any actor who chooses to legitimize smoking is causing kids to take up the habit which is what the tobacco companies want. You have no sense of moral responsibility to your fellow man. Disgusting.
