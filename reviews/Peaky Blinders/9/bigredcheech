This series does an excellent job of keeping the viewer wanting to come back for more and more. A period drama set in the gangster world post World War 1 in England, the series represents the era in a classical/historical way but creates a modern tone via the music they choose and makes the series feel up beat and fresh. The story lines and plots are well thought out and presented flawlessly leaving the viewer satisfied yet wanting more after each episode. The cast is very recognizable and able to deliver on the expectations of the roles and characters. Comparable to Boardwalk Empire but in my opinion better! Hopefully this one sticks around for several more seasons.
