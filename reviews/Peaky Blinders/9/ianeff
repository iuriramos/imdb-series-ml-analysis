Okay, so I don't know why everyone feels as if they have to modernize King Lear any more than I know why Sam Neill's taxis are all back-lit, but I'm really just insanely glad that they are. The cool, clean lines of this thing, echoed in everything down to the cheekbones of the lead, are amped up by the Nick Cave soundtrack, and the film's heavy grain.

In the vein of the retake on King Lear, you have a mother ceding her wartime claim on the family's business, book-making, to her two children. One is willful, the other, perhaps too clever for his own good. Casting a shadow over everything are the early days of Irish sedition.

Watch this. Take this in. It's a masterpiece.
