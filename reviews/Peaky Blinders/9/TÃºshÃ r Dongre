I have literally watched every good show there is on to watch but i like something which has more of a historical feel. Somehow, I came across this amazing show which literally got me hooked up. Cillian Murphy has done an amazing job as a lead who is fierce and loving as well. The whole cast in the show is amazing. Amazing direction, Awesome storyline. It takes you away from the reality for a moment which is what makes it extraordinary.

Imagine Boardwalk Empire relocated to England and revamped as outright pulp instead of prestige TV, and you'd have something pretty close to Steven Knight's historical gangster drama.It Has more direct pleasures than the departed "Boardwalk Empire" thanks in part to a fresh, hellish setting and the reliable chill of Cillian Murphy, whose icy stare pairs well with the show's grim Nick Cave soundtrack.

Trust Me, This show is AMAZING.
