This is the first review for TV. I had to write a review because this show is not well known but should be. Its done so well, such good acting and good cinematography and well written story. I enjoy gangster movies, and I also enjoy movies from other times, so this was a perfect TV choice and it paid off to choose this. I liked boardwalk but didn't love it, this was just so much better. I highly recommend to anyone who likes a well written story. If you like non stop action like a Michael bay movie (transformers), then you might not like and think it is slow. You would be unintelligent, but hey, thats your choice in movies. Now that I found out Tom hardy will be in season 2, I'm even more excited to continue watching. Please give this a shot it is well worth it.
