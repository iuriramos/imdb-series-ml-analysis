I really loved the first season and anxious for watching the second season. I do not get the negative criticism. Awesome cinematography, music, and narrative. Accents are quite accurate for those Who think otherwise. I really can't wait to see what Tom Hardy brings to the story. I'd call it a cross between Boardwalk empire, and sopranos mixed with British humor. I find it to be a very interesting story told in a Time period I'm not all that familiar with in England. The cast is terrific. I'm happy to see Cillian Murphy get A great role and pull it off. He has been in some recent blockbusters and I think This performance proves his talent. Enjoy!
