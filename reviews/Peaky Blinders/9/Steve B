I mostly put in reviews for films or series I really like. This show is great because it appears to be true to period and location, but adds all the plot needed to keep me watching. 

Betrayal, family, business, brutality, it is all there. You really get behind these bad guys in a strong way if you watch it for long. 

The brutality of the police of this era is probably true, but still shocking.

The family interaction is crazy.

The gangland stories are intriguing and somehow underdog type of situations.
