It's winter. It's cold. There is nothing else to do other than WATCH PEAKY BLINDERS. Yeah, I know, the name sounded weird to me too, in the beginning. Even more when I tried to convince my boyfriend to watch it with me, as we were in the early stages of our relationship and that I took everything as a test of my coolness and he said, "What the hell of a name is that?"Â…

Yes. It's not easy being cool.

But there is Cillian Murphy, the amazing actor who I used to consider as a pretty strange beauty and now, after this, I just consider plain hot.

And there is the cinematography of the show that's absolutely stunning. And the story, the one of the Peaky Blinders gang that actually existed in the 20s in England. Oh, and the music. Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, wonderful stuff that fit perfectly with the show. And the stories in the story, stories of passion, of love, and of death. And the fact that it's a Netflix show, which is a real stamp of quality today.
