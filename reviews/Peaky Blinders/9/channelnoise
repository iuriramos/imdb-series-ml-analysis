The season is sheer class which grabs your attention the moment you start seeing it. The good thing about Peaky Blinders is that, it grows with time. The directors have let it grow slowly and have been good at not over doing it. It looks natural and you find it close to reality. Cillian Murphy has been outclass in his performance as a lead actor. Hez cool, classy and is well articulated for future. This is his strongest performance in his entire career and I've started loving him for that. Folks watching Narcos and other seasons on gangz will find this appealing in its own way. A must see for folks interested in top quality British Season!!!!!
