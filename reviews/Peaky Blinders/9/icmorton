I throw myself behind all the applause for this production - it's extraordinarily strong, but just for the sake of discussion, does anybody else out there get a bit tired of watching so many cigarettes being lit or whiskeys being poured? What a load of screen time it takes up! And actually, as much as I love Sam Neill, I find Major Campbell just a bit too evil to be believed. I would have preferred a bit more "grey" in his characterization. Anybody on my side? That's all I wanted to really say but IMDb tells me I have to add more lines! Maybe I will add that Tom Hardy's Alfie is a much more interesting villain to me - a lot more layers than Sam's.
