I never give a ten unless it is blinding so a 9 is excellent but not astounding.

The Blinders really took me to the grit and dirt of post WW1 Britain, it is atmospheric and draws you into the time. It was actually bit of an education of how people lived.

The plot is complex and mysterious and you find yourself trying to guess what will happen next.

There is a fantastic underlying romance cracking on.

There are a good few sub plots spinning about to keep you amused and entertained; a few laughs and feel good moments; a few tragedies to keep you depressed if that's what your into.

I started to relate to the characters quite early on and they are all distinctive. You really feel involved from the start unless you have no social skills.

All in all a good watch, I was waiting for it to come on the next week ... not literally obviously ... I didn't like sit in my flat for a week looking at a blank screen till it came on, but I did look forward to seeing the next episode.

You certainly won't waste your time having a gander!
