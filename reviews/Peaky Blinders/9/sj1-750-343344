I just love this show and had to keep watching to find out what would happen to the characters. The storyline is strong and the writers have done a fine job - you are immersed into the world of the Peaky Blinders who rule 1920's Birmingham. The ugliness of life for the inhabitants of the city is realistic and justifies the decisions that many of the characters make. Themes of loyalty, betrayal and morality underpin the plot.

Stand out performances from Cillian Murphy and Sam Neil - two actors who just never disappoint. The nemesis relationship they have is fascinating to watch unfold. 

All supporting roles are equally as compelling with the character development of family members and those close to Peaky Blinders a joy to watch. 

So many other series have disappointed by being either plot driven or character driven, whereas this show logically and artfully progresses both. The team who have created this series have done a stellar job and should be congratulated for a job well done.

I am hanging out for Season 3!
