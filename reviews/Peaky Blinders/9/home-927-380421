Superbly thought out film. Well done the BBC and the European Union for financing and supporting this film. I loved the way supporting characters come to the fore play their part then gently drift off screen maybe reappearing maybe not. That in itself is intriguing as I don't have the time to consider their direction as I'm pleasantly carried along by the strong story line. Sam plays the bigoted Presbyterian to a tee whose true character is well confronted by his Sargent before what appears to be the big battle. It's not often that the establishment is shown to be rotten and with an accurate portrayal of the 'Hero' Churchill in his true colours of a vindictive thug who history has shown cares little of ordinary people . The only jarring point for me is the accents which tend to Irish rather that mid English but maybe that is only my perception. A great film that I have happily being unable to guess every outcome so far. Episode 6 is that really the last one???
