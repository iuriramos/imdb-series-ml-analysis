Cillian Murphy plays an excellent role as a de-mobbed Sergeant Major who is not about to put up with poverty after returning from Flanders Fields. 

His leadership qualities have been honed by trench survival and a nothing to lose environment in working class Birmingham. 

Small Heath was as much an economic migrant stronghold then as it is now and probably always will be. 

The cinematography creates a Dark Satanic Mill environment where the city of a thousand trades is expressed as a dour backdrop to young and hopeful Brummies whose aspirations don't always keep them within the law. 

Their violent demeanour is secondary to the story and overshadowed by sharp Edwardian fashion, haircuts and their willingness to overcome adversity one way or the other. There seems to be some integrity to their unlawfulness which could almost be forgiven.

The subtext between Londoner's, Gypsies, immigrant Chinese, Italians, Republican and Norther Irish factions, spice up the plot making it interesting and varied to the main plot of stolen guns from the BSA works. " We've got the machine guns now Tommy and they're in the mud"

Based on truth the Peaky Blinders is a refreshing drama about the criminal classes not based in London or Chicago. Such a nice change even though Thomas can't sleep without his opium pipe. Some things never change. 

I'm not one for watching things twice but I have watched all three episodes at least twice as a week is too long to wait for the Shelby's exploits. 

Steven Knight NB - please write more episodes immediately, you've hit a seam now please mine it for all it's worth.
