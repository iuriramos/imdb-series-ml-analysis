Dragged kicking and screaming by my 16 year old son to watch this and I settled down for a night of tedium watered down by a little Budweiser to help time pass...how wrong was I? This is probably one of the best shows I have ever seen, not just on the BBC but on any channel. Every part of the drama - the acting, the atmosphere, the script, the costumes is absolutely first rate. It's a great ensemble piece with Cillian Murphy's brooding and ultra cool Thomas Shelby running the show. Sam Neil has never been better as the squirmingly awful intelligence man, Helen McCrory is brilliant as the grande dame of the family and special praise has got to go to Paul Anderson as the crazy mixed up Arthur - that actor will go places. Read the other reviews to see what it's all about but this show is real class - the excellent special effects, the nauseating violence, the dark, almost Blade Runner atmosphere and the brilliant sets - you can almost smell the iron kilns blinking and flashing. I can't wait for Series 3 and I've already bought the T-Shirt - a shadowy Thomas Shelby with the words: "I do bad things."
