Simply the best I've seen.

It hits it right in the sweet spot between the elements that make up a great TV-series. In my view, better than Sopranos, The Wire, Lost, Downton Abbey etc.

Excellent acting from Cillian Murphy, Paul Anderson, John Cole, Helen McCrory and Tom Hardy. And from the more surprisingly, one has to point out Finn Cole as Michael Gray.

Simply, the best TV-show made.

Hold on - it is a costume drama, thriller, mafioso, (at some times splatter-like bloody), romance, detective, saga-esque series, with roots in Birmingham history. 

Feels like i was written in thick chapters in an old classic novel. Feels genuine and true without becoming a slave to the underlying historical events and people.
