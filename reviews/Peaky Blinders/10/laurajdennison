I personally have never been a huge fan of any gangster drama, but this show is spectacular! The whole cast does an excellent job at portraying their seemingly immoral roles giving them multiple facets to their character like any actual person making the show seem so real, and you fall in love with the characters (even the bad ones). The music throughout the shoe fits every scene perfectly and makes me very excited every time I hear the theme song. The set and costumes feel very authentic and real as though you were in that time period. Lastly, the story is impeccable!!! The very unique time period and location is very original and is something I've never seen before. While you might have seen every gangster drama, this one is not like the others and deserves to be watched to the full extent from the acting to the set to the story. This show is amazing!
