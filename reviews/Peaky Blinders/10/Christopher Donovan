Quite the most riveting Drama I have seen in years and it just gets better and better. Full marks to all who have made this possible.

I read some Mainstream Critics have compared Peaky Blinders with Boardwalk Empire and The Wire thereby missing the boat entirely - Peaky Blinders is Unique. I pleased to read that the writer of the series has said that he has never even seen these dramas - that much is obvious to anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear and I do not wish to demean either series just to say the comparisons are completely irrelevant.

Such a tremendous and deep pleasure to know that there is such a well of talent around and now I understand a 3rd series is in the making.

There is more to this drama than meets the eye - do not be surprised if your 'stable data' about what you thought it meant to be 'English/British' subtly starts to change without your conscious intention! Never forget there is space between words and it speaks also and with such a subtle voice.

Here is script writing of the very highest order delivered by a director and actors at the peak of their game. It truly speaks to parts of you that others do not reach. Wonderful/Compelling the list goes on and on..............................................................and on.
