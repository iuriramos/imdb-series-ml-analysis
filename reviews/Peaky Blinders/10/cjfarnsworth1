This show is phenomenal! A large cast of rich, complex characters, evolving, fully-developed. Humor when you least expect it. Lush settings and costumes (just want you want in a period piece) - can't take your eyes off the screen. Incredible cinematography and the soundtrack - though not period - is perfect...Top quality acting, even from minor characters. Multiple story lines that don't compete, but play together perfectly. Stays away from clich√©...sexy, exciting and addictive. In a competitive genre, this show still rises to the top. Truly satisfying...can't wait for season 3...and many more after! So glad I found this gem.
