Great entertainment starting with excellent casting, very realistic characters. Fun to watch, sex, violence, drama, the underdog, the theme. My new favorite show. Gravy on your mash potatoes baby! The depiction of the era is great. History fans will love this. The show isn't just a depiction of the times, but includes people (don't want to spoil anything here) from entertainers to politicians as well as a great taste of what the culture in England was like at the time. I would recommend the show to most people and to all of my friends. I can't wait for the next season to start. I disagree on some of the critics on other boards making comments on how the story was lacking. Sorry, just never saw that. It just keeps pushing you and pushing you and never lets up. The show doesn't drain you either, as sometimes the underdog wins, and how beautiful is that!
