Seasons one and two were excellent. Sam Neil always does a good job in historical dramas. His role as Major Campbell reminded me of a much earlier mini-series when he played Reilly, Ace of Spies. Grace was very attractive and well cast. Arthur and Polly gave excellent performances. The use of razor blades sewn into peaked caps would not produce an effective weapon but offers an interesting concept. An historical criticism would be that the age that you attained majority in England in the period 1919-1922 was 21 not 18. Polly's lost son could not make legal decisions when he turned 18 as the age of majority was only lowered to 18 in 1970. Home Rule for Ireland was a major political issue and the treaty negotiated by Michael Collins and Winston Churchill was rejected by the Irish Republicans leading to the Irish Civil War.of 1922-23. The Peaky Blinders is particularly interesting as it depicts the difficult transition of many ordinary British soldiers returning home from the First World War. Some of these men brought weapons back to England. Gun laws in England were less stringent in 1918 until the passage of the 1920 Firearms Act.
