I Really love this show.. Just wish the season's were longer. Hate that it only has 6 episodes per season.. Can't wait till season 4. BBC You have a great show right here. Sometimes it's hard for me to understand some people on the show because of their strong accent.. but that's OK I still love the show. It's awesome how this show is presented in the early 1900's.. If your a fan of Gangster movies and TV shows.. this show is what your looking for. I don't want to give any spoilers because I think you really will enjoy this show by watching it from the start without knowing what's going to happen. Ease up on the nudity probably would increase views because more kids could watch and tell their friends to watch.. Over all you will enjoy this show.. watch at least 2 episodes and you will be hooked!
