*Spoilers from Ep.6 of S02*

I can't remember the last time I posted about the impact a piece of television had on me, but I just watched the final episode of Season 2, and it was so wonderfully intense, suspenseful, unpredictable, and satisfying. Cillian Murphy gives one fantastic performance, breaking through his gangster confidence into a believable, compelling, emotional breakdown. And the photography of that scene in the field, it was both gorgeous and chilling. The writers so efficiently tied up all the narrative threads, and did so in such a creatively inventive way. This is such an awesome show and I can not wait for Season03.
