I don't write reviews often, but I love this show. I love the costumes, the music, the way it's filmed, the drama, the story, the acting, and all of it. 

About the accents, I don't come from Birmingham so I can't tell you how off they are, though Helen McCrory (Polly) has said they're actually historically accurate. Also, I feel that I must defend Sam Neill's accent. People are saying it's awful, but it's actually bloody brilliant. I was surprised to hear he's not actually Northern Irish. And also, I am Northern Irish so I would know if my own accent is being done well or not, so those who argue with me can **** off, as Arthur Shelby would say.
