this is solid you can build from it a great TV SHOW . you BBC , just needs to keep it going without changing the main things thats made it solid i wish to see a third season very soon .

every body love peaky blinders and every body wants it to continue. with good development i believe it can get to boardwalk empire and beat it also .

..... ...... ........

and why there's not even an announcement for the third season release 

do BBC considering not keep it going ? 

thats Will be disappointing
