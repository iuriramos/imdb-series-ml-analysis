I was watching a BBC drama called Copper and it was supposed to be the most acclaimed series for BBC America. Then one day on Netflix I stumbled across Peaky Blinders and thought the title was silly and would reflect on the series quality.

Oh Dear Dog. This series is mind-bending from the get-go. The various twists were expected but still done in amazing ways.

I never really thought about the effects World War I would have on men. They came back to lousy dangerous jobs like coal mining (roughly 1 in 5 men worked in a mine) so being in a gang and having the same guys who looked out for you in the trenches in your gang was a natural thing.

What's so strange is the Crown wanted to imprison these guys for things that are legal (more or less) today.

I hope BBC makes more series like these. This is as good as anything I've seen.
