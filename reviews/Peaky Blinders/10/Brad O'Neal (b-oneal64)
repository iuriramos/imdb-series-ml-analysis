I absolutely love this show. I am so glad that I was bored and stumbled across Peaky Blinders on Netflix! I instantly became addicted to it! I highly recommend this show. The Peaky Blinders has everything! Action, humor, sex, drugs, booze, and so much more! I have a new found respect and admiration for Cillian Murphy who leads the show as Thomas Shelby, the success driven gangster leader of the Peaky Blinders gang. I binge watched this show and am so happy I did! Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this show! You will not regret doing so. Peaky Blinders keeps me on my toes. I never know what the Shelby family are prepping to do next! This show is an absolute home run!
