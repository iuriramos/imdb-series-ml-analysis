I just love this show from the characters to the costumes, dialogue and sets. It seems that the US wasn't the only country having problems with its returning WWI veterans turning to crime as there weren't enough jobs for them.

I can't believe just how grimy Bermingham was during the turn of the century and the men who did work did back breaking work in some of the harshest environments.

Cillian Murphy and Paul Anderson are just fantastic in their roles as Thomas the younger but level headed brother, and Arthur the psychotic, loose cannon brother, and watching Sam O'Neil as a heavy is a treat...

If you liked Boardwalk Empire, The Sopranos etc, you will enjoy Peaky Blinders....
