This show is the best thing that the BBC has produced for many years! A true return to form, Steven Knight has done an amazing job and the show just gets better and better with each episode.

The cast are great, Cillian brings a dimension to his character that shows his haunted war torn past is driving some of his decisions and when needed his softer side comes forward. The rest of the cast are great too - Paul Anderson's unhinged Arthur and Sam Neil's calculating Inspector Campbell deserve high praise.

The addition of Tom Hardy's Alfie Solomons is especially enjoyable in series 2 bringing the London Jewish underworld into the mix.

The settings, clothing, props and use of CG help to paint a real world setting that has really impressed me. I come from a Northern working town in England that was built on the iron industry and suppling all sorts for the war effort and i can imagine where i live being quite similar around the time this is set. The location scouts also deserve praise for there vision of what would make this all seem real.

Forget all the American stuff thats starting to become the same stories repeated over and over and watch some real story telling!
