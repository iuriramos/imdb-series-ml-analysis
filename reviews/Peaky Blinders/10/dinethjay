A historical fiction drama, the series is set in the 1920's in Birmingham, in a gloomy, dark industrial setting that is very convincingly but together by Stephen Knight. The rich detail and careful thought put into conceiving the show, as well as the soundtrack provide a perfect look and feel to what you would expect Victorian England to be like.

The writing is incredible and the show is well paced. Episodes tend to exceed 1h in length but the show remains intriguing and captivating throughout.

The acting is on a different level compared to most TV shows, and the characters have a depth and substance that I have begun to miss in other dramas.

Cillian Murphy is probably the best thing that has happened to this show. His portrayal of Thomas Shelby is perfect, and who is without doubt one of my favourite characters from a TV series.
