The ongoing development of characters (read: evolving) was so intriguing and refreshing that I felt like I was watching a new movie at each episode. Finally, here was a gangster movie whereby the lead gangster wasn't killing everyone in sight at each turn like so many of it's ilk. That said, though the violence was not as useful to me, overall it spoke to the rawness of the key characters having recently returned from war and the Post Traumatic Stress that lingered on upon their return. Their suffering continued to play out in their lives as they tried normalizing their place in this down trodden tired town in Ireland. Fewer bloody episodes might not have conveyed as well the intensity of the edginess of their lives. The accents were so interesting especially between the Jewish and Italian Bosses. The opposing characters, the tough iron justice Policeman (Sam Neill) v. Tommy the low key gangster who cared deeply for the well being of his family way was a masterpiece as it ebbed and flowed throughout. The attractive undercover cop, Grace became the center of a growing intensity between these two strong characters. It was loaded with cool and romance. The surprises kept me on the edge of my seat and rarely have I felt so engaged toward the outcome. Whew. Hold on to your hats. Cillian and Sam Neill! Wow!
