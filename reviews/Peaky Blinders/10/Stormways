You know you've watched something very special when you find yourself thinking about the characters afterwards as though they are real people. The sets are atmospheric and transport you to time and place. The characters are well drawn and perfectly cast, especially the brutal and damaged soul that is Arthur Shelby. The contemporary soundtrack shouldn't work but is perfect. It is a dark, haunting and violent drama, that'll have you sitting tensely on the edge of your seat. The only criticism is the occasional dodgy accent, but if you're not local you probably won't notice. The best drama the BBC have produced in a long time.
