Peaky Blinders is an absolutely magnificent series. The "gangster" genre happens to be right up my alley but this show has so much more going for it than just an entertaining topic. The sets from 1919 England are fantastic and while the characters reside in a dark and dirty world there is a haunting beauty to it. From what I know the story is loosely based on historical figures which makes the storytelling all the more incredible. Most everything that transpires is believable or close enough that it never detracts from the story. Finally, the acting. Cillian Murphy is a powerhouse as the leader of the Peaky Blinders. His performance draws the viewer in and holds them close. Throw in a great performance from Tom Hardy and virtually every supporting cast member and the acting is bulletproof. It is a crime to me that Peaky Blinders is not a world renowned television show at this point. I recommend it 100%.
