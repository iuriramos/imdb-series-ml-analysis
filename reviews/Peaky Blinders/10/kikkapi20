Looking for something to watch on *.* last night, I found what I thought was a movie, watched the opening and subsequent scenes and became "hooked." I then realized I was watching the first season, 1st episode of Peaky Blinders. The story line took me further and further in until I decided I just had to keep watching and was going to attempt to watch the entire 1st season. The end of the first episode left me anxiously looking forward to watching the next and so on. I can't wait for the second season. I was sitting here watching the first and thought to myself that Tom Hardy would be perfect for this show, then I get online to read about when the second season is going to be released and I see he's in it. My excitement went from a 10/10 to a 15/10. I only wish that there were more episodes in a season but fantastic show all around. Have had it on repeat since it dropped. Perfectly executed. Brilliantly scribed. I suspect it will do well here in the states. My new addiction.
