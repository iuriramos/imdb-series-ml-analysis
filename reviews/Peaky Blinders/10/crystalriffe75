Found this show on Netflix's, and was hooked from the first scene. I spent the next 12 hours watching the first two season. It is good! Its a believable story line, the writing is intelligent and will leave you thinking. The sound track is fresh and modern and weaves the show together. The casting is amazing, they really make the Peaky Blinder's come to life. Cillian Murphy is at his best, he becomes Tommy Shelby. The filming and the locations of the show are beautifully shot and allows the viewer to escape into their world. So sad I have to wait a year for season 3. BBC please give the Peaky Blinders more than 3 season! Steven knight, Tommy must marry Grace please!
