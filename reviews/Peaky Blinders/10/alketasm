I'm pretty sure it's the best TV show I've watched. (and I've watched a whole lot) The character development is amazing, every character is unique, yet interesting and vital for the progression of the show, the writing is phenomenal and the setting is also on point. The way the viewer feels about the characters, and the amount of complexity and depth of their personalities is also worth mentioning. The acting of course is perfect, not only Murphy but everybody delivers an awesome performance. Great OST, that consists of artists like the White Stripes, the Arctic Monkeys, Nick Cave, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen.

WHAT ELSE TO ASK FOR??? You'll definitely LOVE it!
