I rarely feel compelled to share my views and this will be brief - it's a more of a recommendation than a review...

There is some serious talent on show here, and not just in front of the camera. The production, direction, cinematography, script and score are all world class. Then there's the acting, which is equally brilliant. If you like watching intelligent and pulsating drama you will love this show - it will have you hooked from the first episode of the first season. For me the second season succeeds where many fail, in surpassing the first.

10/10
