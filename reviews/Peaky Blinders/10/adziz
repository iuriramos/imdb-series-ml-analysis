Firstly, I am a fan of well-written dramas. The Wire, Boardwalk Empire, West Wing, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, (US and UK), and Sherlock. Peaky Blinders is up there with the best. The characters are excellent, the script a page turner and the acting, especially by Sam Neil, Cillian Murphy, (my favourite), and Helen McCrory. Post-World War Britain was a difficult place to live in, just as many countries after the conflict. Peaky Blinders gives you an idea of the social problems in Britain after the war...a land 'Fit for Heroes' anybody? Written a long tome before Boardwalk Empire, this is a series worth watching. For non-native English speakers, the accents may be strong so subtitles may be needed.
