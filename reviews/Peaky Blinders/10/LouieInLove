When viewing Peaky Blinders we must remember to put time & geography into context. We're all familiar with American crime-family dramas' set in industrial cities.... but Birmingham (England) was the first Industrial city in the world. Indeed at the time of Peaky Blinders Birmingham was still one of the largest Industrial cities in the world & was located in the largest Industrial geographical area in the world, that being The Midlands of England.... later to be over-taken by places in America but at the time The Midlands was still the place to be in relation to heavy Industry.

Crime gangs/families had plagued the city for decades. Birmingham fueled the heart of the British Empire & there were pickings to be had. Into this world steps The Peaky Blinders (based on a real gang).

I really dig the aesthetic of the show, they've managed to bring an almost sci-fi feel to the look. The accompanying contemporary music also works really well, which is a hard thing to pull off, weaving modern music on a period piece. I think that only worked due to the almost sci-fi aesthetic.

A few of the accents are dodgy, Sam Neil misses his accent beat at times as does Murphy, but on the whole they do OK....I've heard much worse.

Look! No show is perfect, ergo worth 10/10. However I have given this show 10 to encourage those who make TV to maintain such a standard, as there is so much poor-quality nepotistic television around theses days.

I'd like to see an equivalent made in Salford & Manchester set post WWII, when it possessed the largest industrial park in Europe & Salford crime families were infamous (including the likes of Sharon Osbourne's dad).
