Don't dip in and out and don't just give it go . . . instead allow yourself to be engulfed into the hard and dark underbelly of the north of England after the return from war. The Shelby's are three brothers, who like many other men are war torn and tired. The have given it all for their country and yet when they return home the promise of a better life is far from the reality. They must forge a new life of their own and boy-oh-boy do they forge.

I have never written a review before as I have never felt compelled to do so. But in my humble option, Peaky Blinders is the best TV show I have ever seen. Scary, sexy, fast and nail biting it is a must watch for all but the young and faint hearted.

To top it all it has the most amazing soundtrack ! 

Enjoy it people.
