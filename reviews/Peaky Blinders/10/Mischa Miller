When i saw, that Killian Murphy is acting, i was very looking forward to watch the series. I had very high expectations about this piece. In fact, when i think about it, i never had it, that a movie was nicer than i expected. This one was. Its incredible how nice the actors master their characters, especially the three shelby brothers. The thing i adore the most, is the Picture. Very clean, detailed and a lot of new perspectives. The stage is well prepared and organized, and looks always powerful. Every scene has so many detail and is worth to be seen a second time.

Peaky Blinders is original, daring and quality. Peaky Blinders is a milestone in movie History. Peaky Blinders is culture.
