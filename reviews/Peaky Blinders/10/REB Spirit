Spoiler Alert. I LOVE this show for so many reasons. . . however one in particular, is the strength of its women. They are strong, brave, independent, capable, willful yet vulnerable, not unlike the male characters. This is why I am so disappointed to lose Grace. I understand story lines, arcs, etc. but I could see Grace being a steadfast partner (I believe she and Tommy have a deep connection of love and honesty of true self. Tommy was able to let his guard down with her.) She could walk effortlessly in the different worlds. Grace might have been a force to be reckoned with, especially with a son to also defend. I enjoyed Annabelle Wallis portrayal of Grace as woman who played her hand close to her heart, until her love of Tommy began. This grew right into Season 3. Her happiness shone in this life with Tommy Shelby and their son. I hate that she is gone. I will keep watching because there is so much more to Peaky.
