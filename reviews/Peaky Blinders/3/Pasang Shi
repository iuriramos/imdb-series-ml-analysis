I had no expectations but watched because a story set in Birmingham is rare, about British working class is rare, about British organised crime is rare. I was unimpressed. I found it dull and un-involving and hard to watch. 

The sets are very unreal and I was never able to forget I was watching a television drama. The opening sequence was laughable and reminded me of the American movies about Sherlock Holmes but what they would be if done on a tight budget, with few extras, and no CGI. 

Thus far I find none of the characters interesting or engaging. They all seem to be cardboard cut-outs. The dialogue clunks along and now and then a character is given lengthy passages of exposition to explain the story to the thick people in the audience e.g. SPOILER ALERT: the dialogue in the museum or the explanation about the execution which was not an execution. Bloody hell! 

It is a period drama but now and then we get contemporary music (why?) and bizarrely the poet Benjamin Zephaniah pops up now and then dressed as a preacher and spouting doom and gloom on the ungodly of Babylon. So, is this 1919 or 1979? Can we expect every episode to feature a has-been from real-life Birmingham come to pay us a visit? 

It is a dog's dinner of a mess - a nice idea, some talented actors, but the result lacks drama, action, humour, ideas, emotion, aesthetic pleasure. In short, anything to make it worth watching. Some reviewers liken Peaky Blinders to The Sopranos. They have to be joking! This is not anywhere in the same league. If people cannot tell the difference between this creaking BBC homage to When The Boat Comes In and The Sopranos then they should stop writing reviews because they clearly have no idea what they are talking about. 

Will I watch episode two? I doubt it.
