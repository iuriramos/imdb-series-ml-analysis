Just started watching this series... it's really dull. Cillian Murphy is extremely good looking, and he's the only thing that's keeping me going with this series. The characters and costumes are a bit annoying to me. The characters are not relatable - many are trying too hard to be cool and hip. Some look totally misplaced (bad costuming) ie., Grace Burgess. She looks like she's a girl from 2015 living in 1919 Birmingham. The hyper-macho bearded guys remind me of a lot of current- day Brooklyn, SF, or Portland hipsters. The 'gangster' haircuts are too well kept. Guys end up looking like Adam Levine from Maroon 5. The story is (from where I'm at) pretty generic - 'cowboys vs. Indians' style. Very 'American' in that way. The music is extremely annoying. Not sure why they feel they have to play Johnny Cash-styled music every time something's about to go down. Doesn't fit the era. 

Ugh... I still prefer Downton Abbey.
