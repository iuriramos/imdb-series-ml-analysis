After being hugely excited about the arrival of this show, I have to say I abandoned ship halfway through the second episode. 

It feels like a show that needed to be made ten years ago, when it might have felt fresh and compelling. As it is, it appears to have been diminished through the 'drama by committee' process that so plagues the BBC. 

Episode 1 felt like an expensively-dressed Boardwalk Empire impersonator (out-of-town cops coming to get our heroes? CHECK. Mole sent in to get on the inside? CHECK. Trouble brewing with rival gangs? CHECK.) that wore its influences far too heavily and awkwardly.

Sam Neill was excellent, but no-one else was...and these are several actors that I like. It wants to be something it has neither the imagination nor the stomach for (the slow-moing of the clumsily- shoehorned-in violence with the Lees was as gutless as the whole scene was preposterous).

It may get better, but I for one will only find out by other people telling me.

3/10...a real shame.
