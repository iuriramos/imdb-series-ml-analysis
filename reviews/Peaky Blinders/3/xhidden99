If it weren't for the jarring pop music that randomly blasts out this show would be, hands down, the most coma inducing show in the history of television. It can go a quarter of an hour without any dialog or sound at all where the camera is fixed on either one or the other of two faces staring at each other. The only action scenes appear to be a single flashback of the same WW1 event over and over and over by the same character. Moreover Sam Neill's accent is the worst ever. Cillian Murphy's is barely better and not a single actor in the show actually sounds like they're from Birmingham. Somehow this family gang of criminals is involved with BOTH the Gypsies and the communists and entire underpinning of the plot arc is they committed crime against the army accidentally and if only Winston Churchill would listen they could put it all right no harm no foul.
